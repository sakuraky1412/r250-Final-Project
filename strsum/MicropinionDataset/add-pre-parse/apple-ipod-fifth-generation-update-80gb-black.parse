the video stated that the screen is brighter , it is not , side by side comparison showed that the 5g ipod has a red tint , while the 5 .
5g -LRB- the one shown -RRB- has a blue tint .
i would recommend this model to anyone , the audophile , and the person just looking for a cheap mp3 player .
it has a decent size hard drive , and tons of customizable options if you are willing to look for them on the internet i love this thing , and cant live without it .
i got this product one year ago , but now after one year experience i offer it to users who need music like food i prefer it to other ipods cause .
newer ipods can not play videos on widescreen by a simple av cable 2 .
it 's very simple to use , you can control your music even if ipod is in your pocket , trust me .
i do not know why users reviews like this if you know about what is real music then choose this one however if you like distortion music , find other one .
i would have got one sooner had i known it is as good as it is .
i bought the 80g ipod after my family purchased three -LRB- count them , three -RRB- creative labs models for various family members .
they were hard to figure out , and every single one of them croaked within a few months .
just went belly up .
mine went out about 2 weeks after the warranty expired i switched to the ipod and never looked back .
it 's a breeze to use .
i think my cat could figure it out .
and it does everything it 's supposed to do and it does it well .
to top it off , it does n't break , quit , flop over , shake , rattle or roll .
it just works some people have commented that the screen is too small for viewing feature length films .
that 's a matter of personal taste , i guess .
i 'm so near sighted , i need my glasses to find my way to the bathroom , but i have no trouble watching movies on my ipod .
i just got back from a long flight on which i watched 3 movies back to back and enjoyed them all .
-LRB- the battery is up to the challenge , as well .
it took me a few days , but i figured out how to get the dvds i own onto the ipod .
that took care of my one beef with the player .
now , i 'm watching x files and star trek and er and all the movies i 've bought and love , as well as those i 've bought on itunes .
it 's great i do n't want to listen to fm with it .
radio just does n't compare to my own music , podcasts i like , etc , so that 's no problem for me , althought it evidently is to other folks i 've dropped it .
i kicked it .
you name it .
the ipod can take a licking and keep on ticking i do not have enough experience with other products to make much comparison , and i doubt if i get that experience .
why switch when you 've got the best already .
i 'm a tech guy and have always enjoyed the latest and greatest .
with this said i have never seemed to invest in an ipod , what a mistake .
this is a quality product .
i understand why there is so much hype behind these things .
it really is a great product .
i am not afraid to criticize products i do n't like , for example my crappy liteon dvd recorder , -LRB- do not ever buy one -RRB- .
however , i have nothing negative to say about the new ipod .
i am very impressed with the quality , ease of use , and features .
i am so impressed with the quality from apple , and since i hear the same about their computers maybe i will get a macbook pro and drop my dell xps tradition .
i never really cared for the previous ipods and i said that i would never buy one , never say never i have out grown my iriverihp 120 seeing my music collection is 35 + gbs .
i have always been a windows user until early this year when i started using a mac at work i decided on the ipod for not just performance but because of the almost limitless number of accesssories available although some of the other players , iriver , toshiba , etc may have a larger screen here , slightly smaller player there , none have the full package like ipod .
this is my fourth mp3 player , second hard drive player .
you just can not beat it .
this is my third ipod , i had to get the second because i ran out of space .
the second is a diy and it died one yera after i made it .
i had to wait for a few weeks unitil the 80gb came out but is totally worth it .
what a machine .
i think this is an excellent upgrade from apple .
i believe the next one will include options that will make the clones shake in their shoes .
apple is always designed the best products and everyone tries to clone them without much luck .
excellent customer service in the us .
this thing kicks all kinds of butt over the plays for sure rubbish out there .
ipod and itunes is still the king of the hill .
350 for 80 gigs is amazing deal .
if you have alot of music and / or are a movie / tv fan -LRB- like myself -RRB- it 's just the thing you 've been waiting for i go across the contry a few times a year to visit my girlfriend for weeks at a time , and i am considering getting this so that i am entertained on the plain and all by my lonesome self between seeing my gf .
this is for any age and any media lover .
i 've had mine for over a year , and i 'm a media nut , and have hardly even reached the 10 % mark i highly recommend this bad side this has been known to freeze up from time to time when you try and turn it off .
all you have to do is hold down the menu button and center click button until it shuts downs and reboots .
no memory is lost and the battery life is hardly affected .
this thing rocks .
best mp3 player iv ever owned .
i have 14000 songs on it and plenty room for more .
this thing is great .
i would deff .
recommend this to anyone .
apple ipods get a bad rap from the techie community for -LRB- amongst other things -RRB- trying to do much besides play music videos , games , calendar etc .
but if the ipod does all of these things well what 's the prob .
as a person who travels all the time , i love these functions .
the music sounds good , and the ipod keeps track of playcounts and ratings , important if you use smart playlists .
the interface is one of the best ; easy to get to a song even when you have thousands of songs stored on the thing , as the display will scroll faster as you spin the click wheel .
videos load quickly and look great .
and i like the games while this is no sony psp , the games that apple releases -LRB- now with increasing regularity -RRB- are well made , fun time killers and you 're not completely tied to itunes .
there are other music managers , including mediamonkey and winamp , that will happily sync your music to your ipod .
winamp will even sync your videos -LRB- hopefully this will be coming soon to mediamonkey -RRB- .
continue to use itunes only for firmware updates and syncing games no msc support , but the majority of the public do not care about that .
oh yeah , no fm radio either -LRB- though apple sells earphones with integrated fm radio -RRB- .
but who cares , fm radio is terrible these days .
i 've had this 80gb ipod for about six months , and i could n't be happier .
the battery will still let me watch movies on a cross country flight -LRB- preserving my laptop battery for more important work -RRB- and while the metal back does not quite have it 's original sheen , the screen and plastics have held up reasonably well the click wheel has a positive feel , and the software on the ipod , along with downloadable games , makes this a great music player .
being in the market for a good portable mp3 player , i checked out several brands , including the vision .
coworkers had great things to say about their ipods and their experiences with apple support ` when ' their ipods malfunctioned due to their own error running in the rain .
so after reading lots of reviews on various models of music players , i splurged and purchased this gem in january 2007 .
this is my first purchase of an apple branded product .
i basically use it while i am running and working out , but sometimes play it in the car .
i have had no problems with my ipod .
i have had it lock up on me only one time , but i followed the instructions to reboot and have not had any problems since .
the ipod has proven to be very durable for use while working out .
i purchased ` skins ' to protect the finish and the screen .
i also purchased a totally enclosing arm band to use while running .
i 've been caught out in the rain on a couple of occasions while running and these two added layers of protection helped shield the ipod from moisture the ipod 's controls are very easy to learn and navigate .
even while running i have no difficulty adjusting the volume or changing tracks , etc the size is not a problem for me .
others have noted that it is heavy or too large .
it is an 80 gig hard drive .
but i have found its size to be very portable and light enough that it does not distract me while running with it strapped to my forearm or when running with it in hand the sound quality is excellent .
the video and picture qualities are excellent as well .
the chrome and black finishes are beautiful you should be warned that the black finish will easily show the smallest of blemishes , scratches and smudges .
it is worth the extra few dollars to buy a good custom fit ` skins ' and protect your investment if you are in the market for an excellent mp3 player , i highly recommend this ipod .
i got this unit about three months ago as an upgrade from my 2gb ipod to the 80gb and i am happy i did .
i put all my songs about 5 , 000 songs , 15 full length movies and my 4 gb of photos .
i use my ipod every where i go from home to my car to the gym .
it is sleek and you can buy accessories for it like the car adapter so i dont have to lesion to the radio and the home stereo for the ipod .
the only thing is that it scratches easily but overall rating for mp3 i give it a 9 .
i love my ipod .
it becomes pretty much all you need when it comes to your music because there are so many stereos , docks , and cables to connect it to everything .
i put all of my cd 's on my ipod and then stored them away .
i just carry it around and can access any of my music in one package .
i also love the video function , although the screen is a little small .
i can not wait until they make a widescreen one , a la the iphone without the phone .
the 80gb ipod works great for me because i have a huge amount of music from being a dj .
also i have several videos to amuse myself when waiting at doctor 's offices , etc .
it works great for me except that it 's big and heavy , but for the most part that does not bother me .
i 've try 5 of the top rated , this one wins .
a bought this ipod just to back up my entire itunes library and all crucial files on my laptop .
i do not even use it as an ipod , just a cool looking portable harddrive .
-LRB- interesting , i wanted to give it a 10 , but i got a pop up window for confirmation , saying do i really want to say this product is perfect .
im afriad to comment , so it gets a 9 .
i really love my new ipod video 80g .
this is my second ipod .
i find this a nice small way to carry 80g of memory around .
i use it for my music and i just love podcasts -LRB- especially buzz out loud and gagettes -RRB- .
i have a lot of smart playlists that just update themselves when i sync .
i can even put all of my pictures and movies of my nieces on it , very easily converted with itunes in one step .
i have still plenty of room to put more pictures , songs and movies i do wish the battery life is a bit longer .
it is better than the old 30g video i had but it could still be longer .
the screen is still too small .
i think this is a must own or if your a gamer ub3r m1cr0 pwn3r .
i love mine possibly more than i loved the last one which is the 30 gig model .
the only thing i wouild ask for from apple is to give these things a better battery life .
it makes my day go faster until it dies .
it 's depressing when it dies with all the music i own on it .
definately get one of these .
i have a sony nw e99 , which is small , has a great battery life and sounds excellent .
the last thing i wanted to do is buy the apple ipod at least thats what i thought .
first my daughter wanted one , then my wife .
so to kick start them i loaded i tunes onto my computer and started loading music .
i tried several codecs eventually decided on 192kbts aac , sounded good to me .
the whole experience is easy , the music files etc auto updted the moment i attached the ipod cool .
so to stop me having two music systems -LRB- sonicstage itunes -RRB- , i decided i would get my self the new video ipod -LRB- 5th generation -RRB- .
so i loaded my psp movies , then i loaded a couple of hundred tunes , a few podcasts along with a couple of pieces of ipod specific software wow .
truly stunning , all in a little steel and acrylic case .
so i bacame an ipod nut however which things are really better which bits are worse first the audio codecs , without doubt the atrac system from sony is a better codec , the files are better for a smaller size , however does this mean the ipods ones are bad , no .
aac seemed to my ears to be excellent , you need to use a higher bit rate -LRB- bigger files -RRB- , but as long as thats no problem to you the ipods just as good to listen too the headphones that come with the ipod are ok , but i ended up buying a pare of shure e2c in ear headphones that improved things entirely .
for what its worth , i have some sony in ear headphones that are also excellent -LRB- sony mdr ex71sl -RRB- the screen is fantastic but very small for video , however i bought it as a music player , as far as i am concerned the video is a bonus .
whilst the screen is very small i still find it very watchable .
certainly good enough and big enough to watch a movie or two on a long flight .
the podcasts are a great thing , news , tutorials , film reviews fantastic for the trip to work i do wish we had access to all the content for television in the uk that they have in the usa , but i am sure this will get better games its not a psp , but the little games you can get , like poker and pacman are great fun .
once again i see these as a bonus so why dont i use my psp , simple , its too big , the ipod is as big as i want in a pocket .
that said the psp games or films are great on a plane or long journey so has it replaced the nw e99 , absolutly , i loved the little sony device , in fact i have always been a sony kind of guy , but something about the whole ipod covenience and ease of use has been a fantastic experience that i wouldnt want to change the itunes software is fantastic , you can load your whole library of music then make individual playlists for different family members .
you can then very simply tell the software to only update specific things on each ipod .
so mine might auto update andrews playlist along with andrews podcasts and films .
the moment i attach my ipod just those things i highlighted update .
really really cool and easy so really its the entire experience that makes the ipod so good , every component part is excellent , you might find an mp3 player that has individual better bits , ie battery , better supplied headphones , bigger screen etc , but overall the ipod is always close to the top of each specification if not the top .
for instance the ipods interface touch wheel is fantastc , this combined with the internal software makes operating the ipod a breeze .
its also fantastically well made finally , i hope my comments have helped , i bought the 30 gig one , that still has 16 gigs free , thats with 12 movies -LRB- 320x240 mpeg 4 -RRB- , 400 songs and 2 bought games and 20 podcasts loaded .
the music part is just over a gig loads more room .
a few of my friends have 80 gig ipods and have really only used around 20 gigs .
so dont be put off by some comments suggesting you need the 80 .
with regards the battery life , this is an area which is better on the 80 , but i have never had a problem with mine , that said i did buy a micropack dock/battery for the ipod that adds a huge life to battery times and is of course portable .
if you want the ipod to play back movies as a portible player onto a tv , then the 80 might be a better bet .
you can then record the tv shows at a larger file size and larger pixal count , that will of course look way better on a tv but need alot more space for me this is an excellent device that i can highly recomend .
i love my ipod i 've used it for about a year now .
i use it for everything from music to video to even audio books for my classes .
and with an ipod is itunes which i absolutley love thanks to their huge array of podcasts , .
movies , and music .
thanks apple .
i should start by admitting that i am a recent mac convert .
until about two years ago , i is a pc only kind of gal .
however , they say that once you go mac , you 'll never go back .
i now know why .
i purchased this ipod three months ago to replace an old ipod mini that had finally bit the dust .
i decided to go all out with this purchase and get the most memory i could -LRB- i am a music junkie -RRB- when i first started using this ipod , i is only listening to music and a few npr podcasts .
then , i bought a few tv shows off itunes .
however , i is quickly pissed that i could n't load my own dvds onto this device and watch them .
just 30 minutes of google searching and i found my answer handbrake .
this shareware allows you to upload dvds to your computer in an mp4 format , and then drag and drop them to your itunes .
handbrake soon gave way to mediafork -LRB- http / / www .
freemacware .
com/mediafork / -RRB- , the new standard for this application .
while it takes a few hours to burn a dvd , it 's well worth it when you 're sitting on the train/plane/whatever and watching a movie or tv show .
yes , this does suck your battery life a little bit , but not as much as i thought it would .
the battery power on this thing is amazing .
the best thing about this ipod is that it 's almost impossible to fill up .
also , the picture function is really neat .
basically , this is an interactive hard drive you can fit in your pocket i love the whole ipod line .
this is a solidly performing product and i personally see the whole ipod thing as being one of the greatest consumer technologies of our time .
it 's also very eco friendly , because when you purchase music , movies , and other media online , there is no waste generated , no shipping , nothing .
just a quick transmission and you 're good to go .
i would recommend this to anyone who is a media loving person and does not mind shelling out a bit of money for a really good product .
i really love my ipod other than a few minor glitches its awesome i use this all of the time in my car , at home , on the go if you hard wire it into your car it sounds awesome .
they do need a little bit more cases that are fashionable for it but its still pretty new .
this is first and foremost an ipod .
this is the perfect all in one music device .
i absolutely love it 's integration with itunes , and the on the go play list creation is a great feature to simplify play list creation while using the ipod .
the screen is very bright and i can see it even in the brightest of rooms or outside .
while the screen is a little small for feature length movies , it works great for tv shows .
if you 're super worried about the scratch resistance , put a cover on it , they are not pricey or even better put a case on it .
bottom line , the ipod is sleek , sexy , powerful , and as with anything apple makes , it just works .
now the apple earphones may not last long because i blast the hell out of them listening to my ipod all the time .
because it is overall ` the ' mp3 player and no creation of microsoft can ever knock it of its throne at the top .
its awesome buy it now .
i bought this new ipod because my older gen 2 ipod that i got for xmas in 2003 only lasts about an hour on a full charge , and freezes constantly .
my new ipod , which i have had for about 5 months , has only frozen once .
i do not download anything off of itunes , so i have no say about the compatibility of the two or podcasts or anything as such .
in any case , it holds all my music , lasts easily for 12 + hours on a single charge , and the video looks really good .
there is only one ipod , and i am very happy with mine .
the only thing that could make it better , would be adding maybe bluetooth connectivity , so that file tranfers could occur wirelessly , as well as between two ipods .
overall , this ipod is really great .
as soon as i got it in the mail , i got a really great case from iskin .
i still have n't even skimmed the surface as far as space goes , but i did notice that if i look at photos , sometimes it wo not turn off , but you can just let it go automatically .
great ipod .
this music player is by far the best i 've ever had .
sound quality is great , storage capacity is tremendous , and functionality is wonderful .
i had the rca lyra jukebox -LRB- which is a piece of trash -RRB- , and it 's like night and day .
there 's a reason everyone owns an ipod it 's the best thing around .
get it , and be happy you did .
i thought that 80g would be overkill , i have mine for three weeks and over 30g are already taken by music , podcasts , seminars , family photos , tv shows and movies .
so i say get the 30 only if you do not have a lot of music and you are not going to use the videos capabilities which by the way are surprisingly good .
and about that , the little screen is gorgeous and perfect for tv shows and video podcasts .
i have watched regular films but only 30 minutes at a time -LRB- eyestrain i guess -RRB- .
some itunes behaviors or lack of features can be annoying but really is awesome software that does an outstanding job with music .
not so much with files or video overall a great experience .
i love this player .
jay .
ipod world .
i 'm one of those would n't be caught dead with an ipod on my waste types .
like many of you , i 've had or tried several portable music devices waiting in vain for the proverbial ipod killer .
it never came and i doubt it ever will .
i 've used an archos 400 for a couple of years and it has been great -LRB- especially sound wise -RRB- , but i outgrew it .
i 've also toyed with zune , zen , and toshiba gigabeats .
i took them all back for 2 big reasons 1 -RRB- getting content i wanted was not easy , 2 -RRB- we live in an ipod world ipod/itunes dominate .
i hate to admit it , but the signs of the times are clear ipod will be dominating the market for a while because itunes has the widest content in one place , ipod has the largest number of 3rd party accessories -LRB- including bmw/luxury car integration . -RRB-
, and they 've mastered the space/size thing better than anyone sound is a real issue .
sharing is painful .
the principle downside , other than conformity , is that the ipod sound quality is average not bad , just not great .
this is a real issue for any sound gurus .
there are ways to hide it with equalizer setting , other accesories -LRB- i .
docks , headphones , etc . -RRB-
, etc .
but there is no getting around this obvious weakness .
it is even apparent to my wife who by no means considers herself a techie .
again , it 's average and many people wo n't notice or care .
however , i expect this to improve with later versions .
my other gripe is the sharing issue , especially since i use both an imac and a pc .
why can not i push my non itunes content to another computer .
-LRB- i hope apple changes this annoying limitation -RRB- .
after days of tweaking and 3rd party add on software , i now have my libraries almost set jam packed with content .
only going up .
my 80 gig ipod video is packed with itunes songs , my cds , music videos , movies , tv shows , audiobooks , and podcasts and i 'm still only about 40 % full .
30 gigs just can not cut it anymore .
plus , we know apple wo n't stop at 80 gigs we all want portable libraries of congress .
summary .
i give a 9/10 , mostly for the average sound , otherwise it 's a 10 .
in my mind , the total package is hands down the best out there bottom line if you do n't plan on buying online music and you are happy with few accessories , do n't buy an ipod gigabeat , zen , and archos all have much better sound and equally good or better video .
if you are like me and see yourself buying tv shows , movies , music , audobooks , etc .
online and you do not want to restart your collection again in a couple years , play it safe and get an ipod .
you can be guaranteed that you will have a player in the game no matter who else tries to compete .
sorry so long .
i got mine for 290euros last week .
but very very much improved than the ipod shuffle i have .
it has very good video clarity .
if only there is a better option than the itunes software .
great for any application you like to do .
i am happy i bought it .
it keeps growing with extra 's .
something i would like to have for the protection of my ipod is a lead lined water proof pelican case .
i know but it is all it needs to be totally indestructable .
otherwise it is pretty rugged but just do not drop it , or submerge it .
apple has already left its mark on history in the eighties with the macintosh and the classic 1984 superbowl commercial , and it did it again with its imac comeback .
but , the ipod has quickly become an iconic symbol of a generation .
thirty or forty years from now , people are going to remember ipods lovingly i had one of those .
for all the conspiracy talks about itunes compatability and format wars -LRB- which are in essence moot , since most of us archive our music as mp3s , playable on everything -RRB- , the simple truth is , the ipod has earned its spot in the books by being the best mp3 player on the market , shoving aside its ancestor , the diamond rio , until few remember it or the injunction the riaa filed against its release , and then eating for breakfast its competitors and imitators , from the creative zen to the latest incursion , that zune thing that right now is on its way both in and out i got the current flagship ipod , the 80 gig updated video model , as a christmas gift from my wife .
upon opening the box , i is surprised to see that unlike its immediate ancestors , there is no cd included .
you 're pretty much assumed already to have internet access and itunes downloaded .
the included usb connector doubles as its charger though , thankfully , the ipod 's ubiquity makes a large market of power outlet units , audio docking stations , and car chargers available itunes functions as the ipod 's control center .
it offers synchronization between its library and the pod , as well as an interface for uploading photos , video , and a less documented feature , contacts and calendar .
since the latter can not be edited from the ipod , it 's not going to replace my pda .
because my music library is constantly changing , and because i put new music downloads and cd rips into a new folder rather than in the standard music spot , i 'm having to work around itunes ' automatic sync feature , but a manual setting is available and easy to turn on and off .
temporarily creating an itunes library out of my entire music collection , synchronizing , and then deactivating synchronization is a handy way to automate loading the ipod .
though it 's a point and shoot device that 's easy to figure out , there 's still tricks to learn from the computer 's end .
i suspect that future generation ipods will have better stand alone capabilities that will be less dependent on connecting to a computer one gripe it 's mac or windows ; one ipod can not connect to both unless you restore factory settings and wipe out everything between connections .
that means my wife 's new ipod , which i just loaded , will have to be reloaded from scratch in a few months when she gets a mac notebook others gripe about lack of am/fm radio .
i have n't missed it .
i stopped casually listening to radio about a decade ago .
with an eighty gig hard drive , you do not need a radio .
but , if you want the feel of radio , you can compile genre playlists and play them back in a shuffle mode ; similar but without crap in between the good songs the only other gripe is perhaps the pettiest , and yet it 's the only one that affects daily use .
the polished black screen invites fingerprints easily and constantly has to be wiped clean .
and , the accessory wires are white , even with a black player .
still , the white earbuds are part of the ipod iconic design , so i can certainly live with it .
it 's not like i can not find black headphones everywhere .
so far i love my 80gb ipod video , i am not disapointed in the least .
granted i have only had mine since christmas day , however i already have subscribed to several podcasts , have 118 songs and 108 movies and tv shows on my ipod .
i still have 59 .
95gb of free space .
i have watched in one sitting 2 1/2 hours of video with the brightness about 50 % audio about 75 % and feel that one should be able to watch 3 full length movies on a full charge i have seen plenty of comments about the small screen , but to me they are unjust .
the ipod video serves a purpose , and to me it is perfect .
this is about convienence , something to do while waiting for your flight or perhaps an appointment .
it is also a great way to take your movies on the road with you , and use the hotel rooms tv to play them directly from the ipod .
i do not want to pack around anything much bigger then this in my day to day travels .
my ipod , though a bit heavy will easily fit in a shirt pocket , something like a psp , or anything with a much larger screen wont watching a widescreen movie that has been converted to mp4 is a pain for sure , but it is still doable , full screen is definately better .
this might not be the best platform to watch a high action movie , however i still will to me this just seems to be the perfect mp3 player for a video geek , while everyone else on the train is listening to music , you can watch your favorite tv show , movie , documentary etc .
i must say , having upgraded from a 40g photo , the ipod video is really nice .
the screen is noticeably larger .
i 've already watched video on it , and i like it .
-LRB- just do n't try to watch wide screen movies or tv shows .
it 's just too small . -RRB-
also , the battery life is great .
i can not wait to take it with me when i fly .
you 're theoretically able to watch a 2 hour movie three times before you drain the battery the new ipod also gives you more control .
you can change the brightness of your screen , and there 's a new search feature that lets you search your entire collection in a snap .
another great addition is the letters that appear when you 're scrolling through lists of artists or albums .
it helps you keep up with where you are alphabetically so you can slow down and avoid scrolling past it however , like other ipod models , the back of the ipod and the screen are easy to scratch .
it did not really bother me when i had my first ipod ; i just accepted it as normal wear and tear .
however , now that i 'll be watching videos on the screen , i 'm a lot more concerned about it .
i really recommend buying a case .
they 're worth the investment .
i spent alot of time looking at reviews over cnet and i really think that the reviews i read were very helpful .
i started off expecting to get the 30gb zune .
i have had a very long standing appreciation for microsoft and figured that they havent failed me before and i should stay with my company the two mp3 players i chose to decide between were the 30gb zune , and the 30gb ipod .
they both range at about the same price at $ 250 .
1 -RRB- zune pros overall better sound quality , sturdy body , and a bigger screen 2 -RRB- ipod 30gb pros very easy to use itunes , easy functions , and free of bugs .
in 5th gen .
stage 3 -RRB- zune cons 1st generation product possibly not free of bugs 4 -RRB- ipod cons not the best sound quality with stock headphones , scratches easily now , what i have come to realize is that the zune , although possibly a very decent product is in it 's first generation stage .
the newest ipod is now in its 5th gen stage .
apple has had a big first start on the mp3 market , and has become free of any possible bugs , or widespan technical problems .
i have read quite a few reviews on possible problems with the 30gb zune to stop myself from rambling on i am just going to explain one thing if your looking to spend around $ 250 .
00 and nothing more then i think that you would probably be happy with either the zune , or the ipod .
i myself decided to go with the 80gb ipod , first off because its the only 80gb mp3 player at just $ 100 more then the 30gb .
-LRB- 7 , 500 songs or , 20 , 000 -RRB- in my honest opinion , if you want a decent mp3 player go all out , and get the 80gb ipod you dont wan na be worried about filling up your storage capacity and if your so worried about the sound quality , just purchase some $ 30 headphones , and you will be set .
that 's what im doing .
hope this review is helpful .
i bought the new apple ipod 80gb a week ago and it is perfect .
it sounds great and with a 20 hour music playback battery life you can listen to your music non stop .
besides that is the 80gb storage impressive .
no more choosing wich music files or wich pictures , now you can store everything on it .
and with some nice programmes you can put youtube video 's on your ipod , and you can control your ipod without itunes .
-LRB- copy music on different pcs and put together music from different pcs -RRB- .
in the past year or two i have gone back and forth between different mp3 players , brands and models but in the long run i always go back to apple ipod 's my last mp3 player is the creative labs zen vision m .
the form factor was not much different from the ipod video , but getting music on it is quite a hassle .
for me i had to drag and drop each newly downloaded song onto the player , and convert all my pictures and videos with the ipod video , putting music onto it could n't be easier .
plug it in , and in seconds itunes has all your new music onto it .
when i first got this player i had 650 songs , and it took itunes only 2 minutes to put them onto the player .
-LRB- it took 2 hours to get all my music onto the creative zen .
so yes , apple gets a a + for simple and easy to use .
battery life is great , i have use my ipod a ton since i got it , and its still running off the charge it came with and note that is 2 days ago .
apple always does a great job with their screens and the ipod video is no exception .
viewing videos and pictures on it look awesome the new ear buds or head phones do not sound any different to me , but that 's ok because apple always does a great job on sound quality form factor is not any different from the previous ipod video , still the same shiny black -LRB- or white -RRB- with mirror finish on back .
but believe me , you wont find a better looking mp3 player out there , most other companies make there mp3 players look too much like toys , rather than a sophisticated good looking eye catching mp3 player price .
i 'm pretty sure for the 1st ipod video 30 gig , i payed about 300 .
this ipod video is only 250 .
00 for the same amount of memory , that is a big + plus + for me included accessories .
you get the usual player , ear buds , usb cable , and pouch protector thingy .
i do strongly suggest buying a case for your player , its prone to scratches .
i purchased a body glove case and it works great differences between old and new .
ear buds are different .
quick search feature .
better battery life .
buy movies and games from itunes .
and thats really it , its still the same great player the only cons or gripes i have , are i wish they would have done something with the finish of the player so it was not so scratch prone .
and i would like to be able to set a picture as a wall paper like the creative zen .
and maybe get an included case .
-LRB- after all , after paying 250 dollars for it , the least they can do is include a case -RRB- .
so i hope this review is helpful , and anything else , feel free to contact me viz email .
upgraded to the 80 gig at bestbuy .
is still in my 30days and they let me upgrade and gave me $ 53 back video runs great , as well as longer .
can send it right to your tv as well with any cable .
-LRB- if you have a camera video cable switch the video to the red line -RRB- i found a little program that will convert most any video and then i drag and drop it on itunes7 .
0 i hear 7 .
1 has more digital rights which just means mac/ipod wants to sell you more things .
the day i can not drop my own videos of any kind after paying over 300 bucks i will never buy from them again .
as for now it 's still working .
i have music videos i downloaded , dvd 's i copied .
both music and movies , and of course all the free podcast videos i can find .
go frederator .
do not let itunes run you , turn on manual once you grab your hard drive stuff and then you drag and drop anything you need to add or remove .
storage room is excellent battery last forever now it seems better price by far .
80gigs , smoother video , brighter screen , better search function , longer battery life and down 50 bucks in cost .
rad .
this is my 2nd ipod , i bought the new nano about two weeks ago and found the memory size is too small well i kinda learned how to use it with the nano , but keep in mind there is not a user guide in the nano box transfer music from computer is , well u do not have to do anything itune software does it on its own in seconds .
the software look for the difference from the computer and the ipod and makes two device up to date .
it even updates the firmware for you , unlike my old iriver h10 which i read the instructions twice there 's no work to be done on this ipod .
you simply use this thing to listen to songs and watch movies .
over all i love this ipod , and i highly recommend it .
i had the 2nd gen ip -LRB- it took a swim -RRB- and is looking for a replacement .
i checked all brands , and ended getting the latest ipod , big difference in what i had .
same good quality i expected as the 2nd gen i had .
i is not looking for a fm radio/recorder on this unit .
these lack of features should not be the factor on buying it .
the apple ipod video has the best quality in all mp3 player land .
bright color screen , great sound quality , great photo quality , great video quality and so muchm more .
it 's light either 30 or 80 gb .
and it has way more accessories then any windows mp3 player .
plus it has a low price tag for both the 30 and 80 bg moudles .
$ 250 .
00 and $ 350 .
overall , i am highly satisfied thus far , though i would have liked games to be a little cheaper .
if games were half the price they are , i would have picked them all up instead of just one .
i recommend it highly if you don t mind the small screen .
i don t watch for long periods of time , usually 30 minutes to an hour tops and i switch between music and video , so it s perfect for my needs .
i absolutely recommend purchasing it if you don t want to wait for a bigger screen or extended features .
i bought the 80gb version .
excellent value .
the ipod is still the slickest digital player available .
great design , easy to navigate , great integration with the itunes store , very good sound , bright screen .
ability to watch tv shows , movies , play games , as well as listening to music , including gapless playback .
only thing missing is a larger wide aspect screen .
i noticed that there 's quite a large group of people giving ipods a very low score .
i think it 's quite obvious that most if not all of these negative reviewers do not even own an ipod .
they just love to bash apple products .
please be objective and give constructive criticism in your reviews .
i love product .
i upgraded from ipod photo and i am glad i did .
the screen is big enough to watch and not strain my eyes .
the games play is a huge added bonus .
i immediately ordered pacman mini golf .
this product looks so nice that ordered ivisible shield to protect it .
now i do not have to worry about scratches .
apple has to upgrade the casing like the did the nano .
the new 80gb ipod video is not what i expected at first from apple , but i is still impressed .
i expected that a widescreen video ipod would be released with pda functionality .
i would be willing to pay $ 400 for an ipod that also works as a pda and gps .
the new 80gb ipod battery allows you to watch 6 .
5 hours of video and listen to 20 hours of music -LRB- more than i 'll ever need -RRB- .
for only $ 349 it s a deal you can not pass up www .
navobravo .
com .
nice to see the ipod getting some good enchancments , still , id like to see a bigger screen or the 6g ipod soon .
ok so this is not exactly one of those rediculous pmp 's yet .
but the ipod is not about what 's on the paper .
it can not record voice or tv or anything like that .
it can not play full movies comfortably on it 's 2 .
5 inch screen .
it also can not make you a pot of coffee or tuck you into bed at night .
so what .
if you want to put some music videos or short commedy clips to share a laugh with friends on it , or throw some pictures so you can show how you broke you arm in a crash , then this works great .
it 's original design , remember , is music .
not a full computer replacement the 80gb is big , and not many people i know have enough time to fill that , let alone listen to 80 gb of music or movies .
it 's small in size , making it easier than a brick to take around .
controls are always great , and no cumbersome buttons are around to find .
it 's a uniform machine gapless playback it wonderful .
it 's smooth and crates a wonderful listening experience , especially with pink floyd 's the wall .
20 hours of battery life is just fine , as i can charge it up almost every night , after maybe 5 hours of listening a day , 6 hours tops .
i 'll get a power adapter so i can charge it on the road .
no personal eq , unfortunately , but that does not mean that the music sounds bad .
it still is crisp and clean video is good , but remember , it 's not made for long movies yet .
i got a portable dvd player that is 10 inches , and is much better than a little 4 inch screen on a pmp .
and dealing with dvd copywrights and all are a pain , so keeping it simple here is what it 's all about .
and who takes bunches of cords around with them for recording a tv show .
they have itunes , which helps the artists make a deserving profit off of what they make for everyone , everyday .
pirating is a problem , and apple has helped the industry a lot .
that may seem bad , but music is what i use everyday , and have no problem paying a few bucks for it i used to hate ipod as many still do , but after going through iriver , iaudio -LRB- which i still like -RRB- , archos , samsung , and creative , ipod seems to just work .
i got this unit a week ago as an upgrade from my 30gb ipod photo and am very glad i did .
i did a one time batch conversion of all my free downloaded tv shows and movies , and now have 6 , 000 songs , 26 full length movies -LRB- were divx and converted easily for free -RRB- , 8 gigs of photos , and tons of free video podcasts on it had never gotten into the whole podcast thing but found a ton of great free video podcasts on itunes and are great to have new ones to watch every day i also decided to lay down about $ 50 to get all the new games offered on itunes and am glad i did .
thought they 'd be bad but have enjoyed them a lot , especially mahjongg and zuma -LRB- have n't played the others a ton though yet so they could be bad -RRB- i can understand that there are some devices that offer more features or bigger screens in the same price range , but the fanboyism and name calling is pretty rediculous .
i 'm not a sheep or lemming because i like this device .
i 've owned many mp3 and video players .
the itunes/ipod combination is easy to use for me and does everything that i want it to do without a ton of tweaking , managing , wires , setup , etc .
it just works and works very well also , i do n't care at all about lack of in line recording as i do it all on my computer and have no use for fm radio .
the reason i use my ipod so much is because i can not stand fm radio , its commercials , and playlists of only 20 songs .
would like to have am but nobody offers that .
sure many people use ipods as an image thing to look cool , and they 're the popular thing to have .
that fact does not mean that they are not great , useful devices .
just to clarify , my ipod is one of the first video ipods , and the software update allowed me to get gapless playback but yeah , ipod rocks , apple rocks , and that is the end .
the ipod fifth gen update is in my opinion one of the best mp3 players on the market .
the design is wonderful and the performance is outstanding .
my only problem is it scratches like crazy so be careful with this product .
buy new one ipod in our store www .
buynewone .
com .
thank you .
i currently own the 5th generation ipod video as well as the 3rd generation nano .
i love the video ipod as it has more than enough room to store my entire music library as well as a large number of videos and movies .
the design is beautiful but also has it 's flaws as it does scratch easily and shows fingerprints .
the new design of the ipod classic is much better .
another complaint i do not know why apple can not provide software upgrades to allow 5th generation users to utilize the benefits of the ipod classic updates .
of course , they want you to buy a new one .
very happy .
nose supressing head phones small portable .
hi fi stereo player .
my music any where i travel .
i am a returning ipod user .
i had a 4th gen ipod but it is stolen .
i did n't much care for the sound quality but the interface is outstanding i replaced my stolen ipod with an iriver h10 .
the sound is amazing , color screen but a clunky interface now the big rush to get the new ipod touch has left used 5 .
5 gen ipods in the right price range .
sold my iriver and paid another $ 100 to pick up a 2 month old ipod 80 gig video 5 .
5 gen here is what i noticed since coming back .
the sound is much better .
the ear buds are still a poor choice for listening .
the black look is appealing to the eye , granted knowing how easy everything scratches i plopped it in to an iskin evo case and it looks sweet .
next , the video is pretty good .
granted , the screen needs to be bigger but for a flight or commute , it is adequate .
if video viewing were the main reason for an mp3 player , i would probably wait for the new ipod touch in the 80 + gig range .
the interface is still the best i have used .
the screen is crisp and clear and the search function is a great add .
i do n't care much for the games and have n't had a chance to play with the photos but i am sure they will be adequate for quick views but limited by the small screen another great thing about ipod 's they are supported by just about everything out there -LRB- audio wise -RRB- i recommend this player but do not pay too much .
look around on ebay for all those bailing for the new ipod touch .
mine is two months old -LRB- at purchase -RRB- and has 10 months of warranty left .
all for around $ 200 .
i love this ipod for travel i can carry enormous amounts of content with me at all times and listen to or watch pretty much anything anywhere .
the screen is a bit small but it 's bright and clear .
the sound quality is very good and battery life is decent .
no other player has a better user interface period .
itunes makes for an awesome interface with your pc .
yeah , i hate drm too , but there isnt ' a piece of content i 've found yet that i could not get on my ipod with a little help from the interweb .
yes , there are other players out there with better screens that may even be a little cheaper .
however for me at least at the end of the day it comes down to the simple question of can i get the content i want on the device easily .
with my ipod yes , always .
with my zune -LRB- which does have a better screen -RRB- hardly ever , and with far greater difficulty .
i do n't know how i lived without an ipod .
i love how i can watch videos while i 'm on the train -LRB- living in south korea , there 's a lot of dead time , train , bus , commute time , etc . -RRB-
this alone reduced my cyber cafe bill .
i love the storage on this bad boy , i have over 3000 songs on my itunes , plus i 'm a shinchan and doraemon maniac .
other products that have some of the same features -LRB- cowon and iriver -RRB- were just too trebley for my tastes in terms of music one drawback for the ipod in my opinion is a lack of a recording feature .
here , in south korea , alot of the students record their class so they can listen to the lecture later , with the ipod 's storage capacity , they should have a record option , if they had it , i believe they would replace iriver as the king of the mp3 player mountain here in south korea another thing i do n't like , when i watch videos , after one video ends , it goes back to the selection screen .
i do n't want to have to make a playlist for seamless video viewing , i wish they would have the seamless video play .
also it takes a few seconds to load the video , the video does n't start right away .
sometimes i do get the occasional skipping when i take the clip off my belt to choose another song .
and why the heck did the apple experience center close here in south korea .
the contract sellers suck .
geniuses , please come back outside of these gripes , the pros far outweigh the cons , my philosophy anybody that does not own an ipod is an idiot .
apple computer 's iconic digital music players are built primarily by female workers who sometimes earn as little as $ 50 per week , according to an article in the print edition of mail on sunday .
workers labor a 15 hour day building ipods , for which they usually earn about $ 50 per month .
when they 're not on the assembly lines , they live in secluded dormitories that each house 100 people and prohibit visitors from the outside world .
the workers are allowed a few possessions and a bucket to wash their clothes .
it 's a shame to have it .
this is actually my 3rd ipod .
i have had an original 5gb -LRB- still in operation but on a new battery -RRB- , a 1gb shuffle , and now this 80gb ipod .
it is excellent .
i have over 8000 songs on cd which i have loaded into my computer .
this ipod stores them all with tons of space to spare .
it works great in my car with an fm modulator and even better at work in my bose sounddock .
the sound is great as is the screen and interface .
i have owned other mp3 players , but apple 's have always been the best for interface and reliablity in my experience .
this is a great mp3 player .
i especially like the 20 hrs .
battery -LRB- i can get a good 18 19 hrs personally -RRB- the audio is excellent but people tend to bash the ipod of its audio quality , but that 's because the stock headphones are n't great .
i suggest 1 . -RRB-
manually manage your songs on itunes 2 . -RRB-
get a new pair of headphones -LRB- preferably noise canceling -RRB- 3 . -RRB-
get a case for it .
-LRB- iskin is a good brand , but there are others -RRB- . -RRB-
you do n't need an ac adapter but if you 're on the go often , get it 5 . -RRB-
if you want a personal video player , do not get this .
there are other pvp 's out there that give you a larger screen 6 . -RRB-
have fun with it .
hope this review helps people .
i love my ipod .
i looked at all other brands for 2 months and i went with an ipod .
i use it for my music , photos and as back up storage .
i purchased it in december 2006 as a xmas gift to myself , so far i have jst over 1400 songs almost 6 gb , and i have not loaded all my cds as yet -LRB- those who think that you wont need the space think again -RRB- , i am a part professional photographer and i use the photo feature to show current and prospective clients my work , it beats walking around with a large porfolio or my laptop all day .
i have almost 500 mb of photos on -LRB- and counting -RRB- .
i use the external storage feature to back up my photos and other important stuff , i travel frequently and it beats carrying my other usb drive .
with only two months since i have purchased it and i have been able to use 50 % of my storage space .
i would recommend get a case as soon as you purchase it , ie buy the ipod and case together , i have a two a snug fit case for everyday use so that i can plug my fm transmitter easily plus a hard case for travel that can clip on to my belt .
i would also recommend the screen protectors .
basically i stuck on the protectors and put it in a case before i began using it .
i have used it every day since i have bought it .
it is right next to be as i am writing this review .
the only reason it has only gotton an 8 is because i am waiting to see what happens after a year .
i have a 3rd gen ipod and wanted a back up for it once i need to send it it for a new battery .
i use my 3rd gen at the gym , i have the glove cover to protect from drops .
i use the 80 at home to play through the stereo system .
though it does not turn off sometimes , i let it run till the battery is done , they recharge and its fine .
will probably purchase a mini for the gym next anyways .
look the ipod video is the best mp3 there is but it cost to much .
the player itself is not very much but when you add an fm tuner , dock , and new headphones to replace the terrible ones that come with it you are talking somewhere around $ 550 .
the ipod has the market and the docks are why it truely is the best .
so many 3rd party companies have made docks dedicated to it instad of making you use an aux cable .
if your buying it for video i 'd lock elsewhere .
quality is great but the screen size gets old after 45 mins .
if buying it to use more as a pvp buy something like the archos 604 or archos 604 wifi because there screen is much bigger and better quality .
overall i 'd say that the only negetives are the cost and the screen 's size but they are outwheighed by the good qualities such as the sound and the many accessories .
extemely pleased with my nano , i decided on a video .
was not sure about the quality of playback , but purchased an 80gb with a kensington digital fm radio transmitter combo for $ 318 at amazon on black friday .
amazed at the quality , more than i is expecting actually .
the picture is cystal clear and sharp .
i do not even have it on the brightest setting , that 's how good it is .
for dvd transfer , i chose pq dvd to ipod video suite , about $ 24 .
99 online , simple and easy .
now , i really prefer the zune texture , or even the new nano , so why does apple still use the easily scratched model .
with all the complaints .
that is my biggest problem .
for the price , a few charging accessories should be added in as well .
i have always hesitated when it came to getting an ipod .
as a dj/sound engineer , lossy audio -LRB- and video for that matter -RRB- compression just does not appeal to me one bit .
so i 've waited for almost 5 years and since there still is not a 500 gig ipod available to hold all my current mp3 files , i 've decided to settle for this baby and just use it for my special dj mixes .
it seems like just enough storage space to hold all my live or studio dj mixes in their full .
wav -LRB- windows -RRB- uncompressed formats .
this seems to work for me for now .
i currently have about 3 days worth of dj sets stored in this thing in their full uncompressed wav formats and that took me about 3 years to compile -LRB- 1 mix set recorded every other weekend -RRB- .
that 's over 70 cd length dj mixes which is about 40 gigs worth of memory .
so i figure by the time i run out of space , it should be time for an upgrade .
besides , i 'm also experimenting with converting my mixes -LRB- for ipod use only -RRB- to .
m4a at 384 kbps , the highest possible sampling rate on a lossy format that i know of -LRB- which to me means the least apparent deterioration of audio quality -RRB- .
that would shrink the audio -LRB- and video -RRB- files to just over a quater of their original size , greatly increasing the practical capacity of my 80 gig ipod however , that whole itunes only compatible issue is a major let down .
i understand that apple needs to make money but come on , opening the ipod in general to be compatible with other software would greatly increase it 's appeal .
plus , the whole one library at a time synching limitation blows when you have multiple computers .
thank god for podworks .
i bought a 60gb ipod after researching others and i am very happy with it .
my only complaint is screen size .
a complaint in disguse because having a larger screen means hauling a bigger ipod .
with accesories like the new sonic impact video 55 that is no longer a problem .
i know it ups the price , but i can now choose what to carry around .
so , in hindsight , i would have preferred a larger harddrive with the 80gb release in lieu of some of the new features .
i love the itunes software but i have never purchased stuff from the itunes store for two reasons .
1 -RRB- i like to have a hard copy of what i have purchased -LRB- dvd or cd -RRB- as a back up and , 2 -RRB- the video and audio quality is superior on the conventional media so , why pay the same price at itunes .
all i have to do is convert the files on my own .
i will get the new ipod because my son is using the 60gb .
weather this player is the best or not depends entirely on your expectations .
i found it amusing to read people putting down its sound quality .
i choose the ipod after giving up on a sony minidisc player and and a zen from creative .
it all boils down to taste .
shop around and actually try the devices at a local store before buying them .
go with what you like and not what raving fans of a particular product advocate .
incidentally , i am an ipod raving fan .
i have not complain about this mp3 player -LRB- sound quality and battrey life could be improve -RRB- but only about online store and appple strict user end policy .
like no monthely subscription service on itune , movie and tv shows not available for other countries .
registered compu synec only .
btw some ipod fav sites are very strict too .
person not alowed to say anything like even cons or loose membership what a freedom by ipod fav sites .
personaly i listened quite few other players too and iam convinced to buy other mp3 player if i want exc sound quality , more battery life , fm radio , voice radio and monthely subscription .
like cowon iaudio x5l , new toshiba gigabeat , creative and samsung mp3 players -LRB- upcoming zune will maybe better choice too -RRB- .
i wanted to upgrade my 30gb ipod photo over the summer but is in fear of apple releasing new ipods or an update to this one so i waited to see what would happen .
i have this for a few days now and i will say it is amazing .
i have used the old 5g ipods several friends have and this one is much improved .
i think the 30gb feels a bit too thin holding it and fragile and this is still actually a bit thinner than my old ipod photo so i like the size .
the screen is very nice , the old 5g ipods i thought had some of the best screens i had seen but this new one is very noticably better .
the ipod + itunes interface with my old photo is good but all itunes did is update songs , i had to use a seperate ipod updater to update firmware and such .
now this is all built into the new itunes 7 , syncing is also a bit faster now and the managment of the ipod in itunes is excellent .
finally the battery life finally on par or better than the competition .
the one thing they could always hold over apple is they had better battery life .
while some players may still have better battery life the ipod now has nearly an equal amount .
our power went out at school the day after i got it for 14 hours and i watched videos on this for well over 6 hours after all my friends had died out after 2 or less .
after recharging audio battery life is very high , in 3 days using audio only it still has about 1/4 life left and i would have had to recharge my ipod photo probably after 2 days of use i would recommend this that people purchase this over the 30gb version , for $ 350 you get a high capacity player with excellent batter life , even though the 30gb is only $ 250 if u think about it its only $ 50 more than the 30gb used to be and less than the 60gb is and most other mp3 player makres charge more for this much space or less .
_____________________________________________ .
pros .
the interface is very comfortable , but getting to the now playing screen can be slightly annoying .
i really like how the letters show when you scroll , although i really stopped noticing it the video playback is great , despite the screen size it looks great , as with all apple products the price is very reasonable , especially now cons .
as pretty much anyone knows , it attracts scratches ridiculously it looks pretty big in your pockets because of how thick it is compared to newer gadgets the stock headphones suck you can not change the look of it whatsoever , unless you rockbox it , but that really ruins the great interface of the ipod anyways not everyone likes the click wheel , i know it took a little while for me to get used to it _____________________________________________ .
notes for nit pickers .
the audio quality is merely average , which most people wo n't notice does not support lossless and some other formats it gets even fatter with a big case lol my hold slider is pretty weak , not sure if anyone else has this problem .
i 'm not really bothered by it at all , but it 's worth mentioning you need itunes to transfer music you can not update your ipod if you 're on a different os than it is formated to .
i set up my ipod on a windows computer but replaced it with a mac .
i could fix this problem relatively easily , but it 's still not convenient .
as always apple brings out a device that looks stunning , design never is their problem .
however , because it has become more of a fashion icon then a music player it also becomes overpriced .
true , it brings quality but make this thing cheaper and it would be true hit .
also itunes works bad under windows , it not only installs services you do not need , like iphone synchronization and such , it 's also slow .
only got because so people have itunes .
i love the ipod 's .
i have had 5 of them and only 2 have been retired .
i 'm just getting bored with it .
good but is it worth the money .
dear steve can you advise me what to do with delkin remote and mic/loudspeaker which i 've been using with ipod photo 30gb .
80gb has no socket for these accesories anymore maybe new 6th generation will have all these inside including headphone splitter and fm radio .
i really like this device , the 80gb model is much cheaper then the old 60gb model .
i like how apple udgraded to a brighter screen and better playback for movies , and videos .
but i wish there is wireless capabilties as well .
apple made a great model , but we need a bigger screen , maybe like a 4 inch screen .
earbuds work great and are better .
i rate this iteration of the ipod a 7 because to me it 's not really a new generation of the ipod , even tho it 's being called the 5 .
5g ipod .
the fourth generation -LRB- 4g -RRB- ipod started out with the removal of the four buttons under the screen of the 3g , and integration of those functions within the click wheel , ala the mini .
but the initial 4g ipod is a monochrome screened ipod later , the 4g ipod got a color screen , and is then called the ipod photo , but it is still the 4g ipod so the latest ipod upgrade is still the 5g ipod , imo usually the ipod has been known to raise the standard bar to a certain degree in styling and ease of use , and other digital audio player -LRB- dap -RRB- makers would follow .
in the case of the 5 .
5g ipod , however -LRB- as well as the 2g nano , it seems that apple is having to play catch up to respond to other dap makers challenges the 5 .
5g ipod is basically the 5g ipod still looks the same , still feels the same , with only a few feature upgrades .
new features such as gapless playback , the brighter screen , brightness control settings , and the interactive search feature , are all features that have been implemented by other dap makers for quite some time .
in fact , the gapless feature is not a feature of the ipod at all it 's implemented into the new itunes 7 , which analyzes your music library , and adjusts the music by removing the gaps , before it 's downloaded , or synced , onto the ipod .
there is new firmware for the ipod that accepts the new implementation , but really itunes 7 should get this credit more than the ipod .
but since the ipod can now play this gapless music , with the assistance from itunes 7 , then i guess it 's better than nothing it 's just funny to me how when this feature , along with the brightness control , interactive search , a fm tuner , a user eq , voice recording , or on the go playlisting is always listed as pro 's for other dap 's , they were summarily dismissed and laughed at by the ipod faithful as being geeky techno frills , and irrelevant .
now that the ipod has -LRB- some of -RRB- these features , cnet has to provide an unprecedented , in depth analysis and dissection of each feature -LRB- gapless , brightness control , etc . -RRB-
, which is never done before with the other dap 's .
but then , if cnet did not , there would be nothing to review here , would there .
the brightness control is a good thing , if for no other reason you can adjust it down and save battery life .
i thought the screen brightness is fine before , with the 5g ipod .
the big problem , though , is the wasted screen real estate of the ipod 's screen .
there 's too much empty white , which makes the added brightness even more uncomfortable to view , unless you 're viewing photos or a video .
why could ` nt apple come up with colorful wallpapers , backgrounds , and themes .
now that the creative zen vision m , toshiba gigabeat s , iriver clix , and soon the microsoft zune have these features , the ipod 's gui looks old , and dated .
i 'm surprised at this ommitted upgrade the search feature , like gapless , is also welcome as any added feature to the ipod would be , since the ipod has so few features .
but seriously , any dap with the storage capacities of the ipod really should include some form of interactive search function as a default , as the libraries are just too large for manual seek and find expeditions .
but once again , as with gapless , the ipod is playing catch up here .
the interaction of this feature is definitely inferior to the feature on the zen vision m , which uses a graphical qwerty keypad , and can search more categories than the ipod 's feature , such as genre , etc .
the vision m 's feature looks nicer , and more thought out and refined than the ipod 's .
this may hark back to my gui issue above about the only upgrade to the ipod that i consider to be both exclusively attributable to the ipod , as well as a pro active upgrade , is the capacity increase .
but again , i have to consider that the vast majority of the ipod masses , or the dap masses for that matter , do not have such massive music libraries that will require such size .
i know 2 other people that have the large 30gb 5g ipod , and they both have 5 10gb of music , photos , and videos on them .
the discontinued 60gb 5g ipod would 've been more than sufficient for holding music , as well as a vast video library the 80gb 5 .
5 ipod will be excessive of course , there will always be some out there who would prefer a 200gb ipod , but they do not represent the ipod nation at all there 's a reason why the 4gb 6gb ipod mini is -LRB- and still may be -RRB- the best selling ipod ever , and why the 1gb ipod shuffle and 2gb 8gb ipod nano easily out sells the full sized ipod so after that , we are left with the same ipod , with the same -LRB- basically -RRB- design since 2001 , and the same highly scratchable body .
there have been more people screaming for a user eq than there have been for gapless .
the color screen and video playback is still bested by other dap 's that have been out there for the better part of a year -LRB- vision m , gigabeat s -RRB- , and the audio quality is bested , as well -LRB- vision m , iaudio x5 -RRB- .
the new prices are great , but even tho the 30gb zen vision m is at $ 299 -LRB- msrp it has since been lowered to match the 30gb ipod 's $ 249 -RRB- , you could buy it for around $ 250 $ 260 at several online sites .
so based on what 's really put on the table , i give it a 7 ok , but definitely could be better .
i have owned a sony nw hd5 for the past year , and have been spoiled by the sound quality it produces .
however , i could not pass up picking up this new ipod -LRB- as i 've been an avid dissenter of ipod culture for the better part of 3 years -RRB- because of the many features taht were added , battery life in particular .
the ability to play movies , games , and such are very nice as well , and the 80 gig hard drive and 349 price make it a steal with the good comes the bad as well .
the sound quality from the ipod does not compare to the sony , in terms of overall clarity .
the bass often time blends into the music failing to define itself as the beat .
i 've listened to the same songs on both the sony and the ipod through the new bose quiet comfort 3 headphones and there really is no comparison in terms of sound quality .
however , the ipod is just infinitely more convenient , which is why i like it .
the ability to make playlists on the go , itunes over sonicstage , and the many many available accessories for the product give it an edge over all other mp3 players on the market please do yourself a favor if you buy this ipod or any ipod , go out and buy some real headphones .
as much as apple has done a tremedous job marketing their product the quality of their headphones is absolutely atrocious .
for a 350 piece of equipment do yourself , and everyone around you -LRB- since they can probably hear your music leaking through the stock headphones -RRB- a favor and buy sony 's $ 30 sound isolating ear buds , the clarity you will get out of the hi 's and lo 's of your ipod will increase tenfold .
okay , so the ipod has gapless playback and brighter screen .
great .
but its not worth the money to buy a new one from the previous one .
and i think the ipod trend is starting to end .
wire head phone is a little outdated .
if i can listen to music on my cell phone via my bluetooth stereo head phone -LRB- a2dp -RRB- , why can t i do it with ipod .
imagine you can connect your ipod to your home stereo , car stereo without any special adaptor wirelessly .
c mon , cell phone companies can squeeze bluetooth into their tiny cell phones to play music , why can t apple do that to their ipod .
over all it 's a very simple and easy mp3 player which i think is part of it 's appeal .
it looks gorgeous , but it falls short when it comes to capabilities .
virtually no features most other mp3 players have .
not very far along on the mp3 player evolutionary scale .
but i will say the price for an 80 gig player is amazing .
prior to buying an mp3 player , i borrowed a friend 's 30 gig ipod for a trial run .
i also borrowed this 80 gig ipod .
i finally bought the creative zen vision m 30 gig mp3 player .
although the user interface lozenge of the zen takes some trial and error , i love the sound quality , the fm radio -LRB- for times when i tire of the music and books on tape -RRB- , and it has an amazing battery life -LRB- compared to the ipod -RRB- .
the screen graphics are also far superior .
i only listen to songs i rip and burn from purchased cds , as i do not want the hassle of drm , so not having itunes does not affect me at all .
i like the way the nano and ipod video work , i do , but why can not see that they are missing a market .
i would love to have a high capacity mp3 player that is small enough to take to the gym .
the nano is too small , why not beef it up a bit .
how about an mp3 only the size of the mini -LRB- maybe even a little smaller -RRB- with a 20gb and 40gb version .
give it a nice color screen and i 'm in bliss .
i would be able to put most of my music on it , but still take it to the gym .
i do not need video , in fact , i rarely see anyone watching videos on their ipod .
i 'm telling you apple , there are many more like me .
feed us .
i bought one of these apple 80gb ipods on jan .
6 , 2008 .
this morning i plugged it to my computer .
it said sync complete .
when i disconnected it and check the ipod there is nothing .
none of my ipod from the itune has been uploaded .
whats wrong .
really , i tunes is ugly .
there is no eye candy .
the interface is really clean , which is good and bad .
at least they should have had some visualizations for the price .
the battery is poor .
like 4 hours poor .
its horrible .
the screen is excellent , and if the battery goes it makes a wonderful external hard drive .
if you honestly need to have a top of the line mp3 player and want an ipod but do not want to use itunes , winamp .
has an itunes plugin .
yes and unlike itunes , you can use the ipod on any computer with winamp and you wont be prompted to wipe the ipod .
also it will not sync the entire media library to the ipod .
just what u want .
unfortunately , there is no video support .
pay the $ 20 and get the full version of winamp and unlock the aac + encoder for winamp .
it converts 3 times as fast as itunes aac converter .
there is no antipiracy restrictions allowing you all the freedom you need .
and winamp , when skinned looks sweeeter than itunes .
plus it does not require quicktime -LRB- which kills system resources -RRB- and takes little or no time to install .
the free version of winamp works fine , u jus have no aac conversion .
i can not delete song from ipod .
do not have touch screen lock .
every song come out different volume level .
itune software required to manage media contents , can not manage your own media without plug into the itune available pc .
this is still the same old concept of mp3 music player with some photos and video capabilities , but still for video is far behind other brands such archos 604 , cowon a2 , creative and other really video players , also is missing the fm radio and todays must have wifi this is a big apple business behind their video/music store and that is why is itunes dependant , but they are not anymore focus bringing the latest technology in their ipods cause they dont do the money with them , it is in itunes and their online stores so i would say if you want a real open mp3/video/picture / fm radio / look at other brands starting wiht the ones i mentioned before .
with all the great features of this player and now with 80gb storage capacity and a brighter screen this version of the player seems more like a firmware upgrade than a makeover/update .
gapless playback should be available for all players including the first 5g ipod .
if apple feels this is a ligitimate selling option for the player then i feel abused .
make gapless available for all apple players .
update the old firmware or get rid of your apple firmware and go to rockbox .
org and load their free firmware that has gapless playback and no restrictions .
well i went to best buy to get my ipod 30 gig , thinking it is going to be one the best mp3 players ive gotten well i is wrong a week or so after that it starts freezing it took like a 1 min .
to turn on and when you do it freezez i constantly go through this procedure , another thing is sometimes when you have it hooked up to your pc all night it doesnt charge .
if you only use your music player while sitting at your desk , or have it plugged in to speakers as your home stereo , then you should have very few problems with the ipod .
if , however , you listen to music in the car or while walking/jogging , the scroll wheel could very likely get you killed .
it is inaccurate , especially when you 're already moving .
you have to look at the screen when you are selecting songs , which is why it could become illegal to use ipods while crossing the street in ny .
nine times out of ten i scroll past the song i want , then scroll past it again while backtracking , then again and again for something marketed as a player for people on the go , the ipod is a complete disaster .
it does play music , though , so if the price is right and you just need a music player you wo n't be disappointed .
i give it a seven just because it works as for features , it is well behind the competition .
does n't work with subscription services , does not have fm or recording capabilities , poor battery life -LRB- mine dies in under eight hours -RRB- , only plays one format -LRB- and itunes creates a second copy of mp3s when it converts them to aac -RRB- , and the playlist feature is a joke .
you can not add to the current playlist in the middle of a song you have to change albums/playlists .
you can create playlists , but only one per day and you can not name them or remove songs once they have been added .
itunes has all the expected playlist creation features , but the device should be able to do more .
i have been using a zen micro 4gb for about a year .
i though i needed more storage space .
i bought the ipod from costco as soon as it is available i transferred about 10 different albums of various types .
i connected my shure earphones and i thought the quality of playback is a little off i connected the ipod to some decent hifi equipment and the sound is really poor no matter the equalizer settings i connected my old zen micro and played the same music .
there is almost no difference between the original cd and the zen if you are into sound quality , do not waste your money on the ipod .
among the included features , if anyone has noticed , the letter search when you scroll fast through your music library is actually included in the current update .
so , everyone can get the letter search so , overall , the only real change in the new ipod is the battery life , size , brightness , and the typing word search .
not exactly worth an additional $ 350 .
the biggest gripe of this player is sound quality , which for being released in this day and age is inexcusable .
i work at an electronics store , and there is no way ipod lovers can tell me that this player compares in sound to the new zune , the cowon 8gb player , and anything by creative which is tops in sound quality .
i mean all the other features are important , but c'mon , does n't it all come back to sound quality .
and i do not want to hear about ripping quality , because at 80 gb capacity , i ripped every track at 320 still poor sound quality .
to ipod lovers who fell into the media hype get out there and get a better player .
i switched from this thing to a zen vision m , and i must say , this mp3 player is crap compared to it for a number of reasons .
too many to list go look for yourself .
ok will i bought a brand new 80gb ipod classic and i must say i loved the mat black front cover and the cover flow from the iphone .
now this is my first ever ipod and well the first time i 've ever used anything apple in my own personal loife .
and i is all hyped up and happy about it untill a week after getting it , it decided not to accept the file transfer cable ok im gon na be quick i loved my 80gb ipod classic , i mean it is my first ipod and the first time i 've ever used anything apple in my personal life .
ok i started putting all my music that i had on my computer on it and i got about 8gb onto the device until well today when i woke up and attempted to put some more music onto it when out of nowhere and i mean nowhere because i used got done transfering files onto it at around 10 the night before .
and to my complete amazement , it would n't allow me to do it anymore .
i checked my computer everything is fine .
so since i work at best buy i took it to work with me and let geek squad try to connect it to their computer using the same cable and still nothing , then they tryed a different cable from a brand new classic and still nothing , then the tryed an older ipod cable and still nothing work .
so to kind of get to the point i had about 800 songs i downloaded that i can not get back because i deleted them off my computer because i thought i had a ipod that worked .
so people make sure you do not make the same mistake i did .
i 've had my 5th generation 80 gb ipod for less than a year it recently died completely and so i sent it in for service .
the front of the ipod had separated slightly from the back on one of the sides , due to no fault of mine whatever adheres the front to the back had failed , and the separation is very slight .
however , apple summarily declined repair/replacement due to this hardware failure , which they deemed damage .
i even have the extended applecare program , but it did not make a bit of difference .
i tried to escalate my calls as far as i could , explaining how well taken care of it was , and that i had nothing to do with the hardware failure , but to no avail .
this is my second ipod , and second hardware failure consequently , i 've come to the conclusion that i can no longer invest hard earned money in a company that does not stand behind the workmanship of it 's products .
which is a shame , because i do like apple 's platforms and interfaces have you noticed that ipod owners all seem to have had multiple ipods .
not necessarily by choice they fail , you get a new one it seems to be some sort of addiction .
and ultimately , if people keep buying them , then i guess it 's good for business to make a crappy piece of hardware .
hey , at least they look pretty .
i would look closely at all options before buying an ipod because chances are , if you do buy one , you 'll end up regretting it .
after owning this ipod for one year , it stopped working .
i took it in to the local apple store for repair and is told the hard drive is fried .
they asked me how i used my ipod and i told them that i used it to listen to music while i took my daily two mile walk .
i is informed that this ipod is not intended to be used while walking as the hard drive can not take the jarring .
i will not buy another one .
i am outraged with apple .
com .
i purchased a very expensive -LRB- $ 350 -RRB- ipod -LRB- 80 gb w/video -RRB- for my son less than 1 yr ago .
it now does not work .
it is still under warranty .
i contacted apple support .
apple said they had received many calls with the same problem the ipod will not turn on , instead www .
apple .
com/support/ipod is displayed and it quickly shuts off .
it also says low battery , please wait although it 's been charging for days .
apple support informed me that the ipod needed repair .
i is told that i would have to pay to have the ipod shipped back to them .
i is given the option of paying $ 59 .
99 for shipment that includes a 1 yr extended warranty or $ 32 for shipment alone .
i opted for the $ 32 .
however , apple said it would take 3 wks for repair , 2 days to receive the return pkg needed to return the ipod , plus .
days for dhl to pick up the ipod .
meanwhile the warranty period is ticking away and i 'm not given any compensation for the time that the ipod is under repair .
i am truly outraged .
why should i have to pay anything for a defective product that is still under warranty .
it should not cost $ 32 to ship an ipod .
most companies will fix or replace a product under warranty at no cost to the consumer .
i is told that it would cost about $ 300 to repair if the warranty had expired , or i could trade it in and get a 10 % discount on a new one .
no thanks .
this is the 3rd -LRB- and most expensive -RRB- ipod that i 've purchased for my children .
it is definitely my last ipod purchase .
i is so excited to try out my new mp3 player because i have a zune currently .
i is a happy with it but wanted to see if apple could win me back .
well , after playing with it for a few days i is back in the store with the receipt to return it .
i tunes 7 .
x is worthless and and it deleted my songs , which i had trouble with previously in my nano .
i think i will stick with my zune a little while longer .
anyone thinking of buying this , bid fairwell to your family , friends , wife and children as you now have a new thing in your life that will consume you the first few weeks were fine , then the error messages started .
there is little support in trying to figure them out it has stuffed my computer , and now after two weeks it simply does not work .
can not sync anything , it 's error message after error message this thing is going back in the box and back to apple .
after my 1 year run and complete disgust with my 30gb ipod which spent as much being repaired as it did playing music i decided to give apple one more try to redeem itself .
i is still skeptical when i first started up hearing already of the horror stories week 1 and 2 passed without a hitch , and all is well in ipod land .
finally week 3 came and i wake up and unplug my ipod from charging for about 4 hours and nothing happens when i hit the buttons .
no light .
no icon .
even when i hold the buttons to reset it .
i take it back to the store and they tell me it 's a manufacturing defect , and that it 's pretty common with the new video ipods .
and with that i politely requested my money back maybe some people somewhere in the world have an amazing ipod that works consistantly , and they should by all means stick with it .
but apple seems to just want to pump these things into as many people 's hands as fast as possible while compromising their overall quality i 've had my toshiba gigabeat s for almost 7 monthes now and have not had a single problem with it .
it works today just like it did the day i opened it and i could n't be happier bottomline if you do n't mind very possibly and very frequent breakdowns and irritations ipods are fine .
but there are mp3 players out there which are much better imo both price and quality wise .
being first does not make you the best .
well i have the same opinion as the cnet editors review comment but some addional stuff though lets start with itunes itunes is one of the worst organized for mp3 player , when you sync its all over the place , why cant you just have a a few folders like windows explorer were there are seprate .
like it doesnt do that i mean whats the point of not customizing it if u want it in any way u want it .
even with the hidden files .
i had trouble putting single songs and movies on the itunes -LRB- sync -RRB- cause it wo n't show .
the itunes is an unorganized program the settings of the ipod is still the same no additonal or advanced selection/options/function .
delte file or folder , fast foward -LRB- skipping -RRB- view of the screen etc such as fm radio , wireless , recording ; small screen not conducive to movie viewing ; proprietary usb cable ; narrow native video format compatibility ; body is still scratch prone -LRB- as i agree with cnet , sorry for copying -RRB- .
other things like changing your desktop screen or backround , advanced sound/video settings , control is so much better but -LRB- why an circle pad . -RRB-
, etc but the one thing that ipod is only good about is the storage , price , and the size of the ipod this ipod isnt mine i is just comparing what is the majior diffrence between creative m vision 30 gigs -LRB- one i have -RRB- to ipod video 80 gigs -LRB- co worker won the prize @ christmas party -RRB- hint do not follow the brand name or popularty .
ask an xpert how to buy technology like cnet , engineer -LRB- technologist -RRB- , college eg .
bcit -LRB- any college technology -RRB- , microsoft , creative , toshiba , a friend who knows some/alot about -LRB- advanced technology -RRB- of these things .
etc but do not ask the company that you are buying from .
they just want to eat your money like apple ps ipod is an ilemon .
the only reason i got the ipod is because it is available for $ 200 30gb -LRB- 180 + tax + free shipping -RRB- refurbished on the apple store website we 'll it looks good thin compared to some other hd players .
some find the scroll wheel to be a really nice way to browse through music .
i find it really annoying .
it can be difficult to get in between two items to select a song you want to listen to .
i do n't like circling my thumb a thousand times over to scroll through lists either .
it would be nice to just hold down/up a button music with blanks listed for the album space are hidden , since it does not show the all album list you can not get it in your ipod spending all day messing with id3 tags is not fun .
you should be able to select music and have it listed from the format it is already in .
usually in the format artist name of the song i do n't see the point in the mirror/shiny backing since it 's going to get all scratched up anyways , as well as the front/screen when you put it in your pocket , you will have to put on the hold switch everytime .
that 's unless you want music blasting in your ears and going whisper quiet every 3 seconds since the volume is controlled by the super duper sensitive scroll wheel itunes , in short , just sucks with the whole tagging -LRB- it 's my problem .
since we 're paying with money , they should at least think to make a decent product with a decent software to make things easier and save time .
if it were free , no i would n't be complaining -RRB- .
they should think about use from the consumer 's point of view you can not add multiple songs at a time by selecting them , you can only add one -LRB- actually it 's four -RRB- song at a time or select a whole folder if you want specific/some songs you will have to make a folder move/copy the songs over , then browse and select that folder to add the songs , which is just a pain copy files to itunes music folder when adding to library is not selected by default , which just screwed everything up for me with missing songs and everything what 's even worse is that you can not back up/move music/videos files that you 've added to your ipod since itunes does n't allow that if you browse through explorer , you 'll see that the files are hidden there are 3rd party programs that do allow you to back up files , many of them you have to pay for and do n't even really work all i have gotten are errors , it will just copy ~ 50 songs and say the ipod is not connected , or just freeze up games do not go well with the click wheel controller at all i could go on some cnet editor even uses the toshiba gigabeat more than the ipod , take that as a hint .
a new ipod and a new flock of sheep will jump on board to buy it baaaaaah you are funny sheeple let me break down why this product and continues to be a joke minor upgrades , same price .
hey apple , why not make a major upgrade for once .
are you telling me they can not give a bigger screen , more file format playback , record feature , a removable battery .
why not .
because they want to sell you their movies and tv shows on itunes .
each person that buys the device is a potential sale on their online store on my archos 604 i can either download from pay services or for free i can program it like a tivo to record tv for me automatically or record dvds directly to the unit plus i can play it back to my tv for free did you read that for free the archos 604 screen 4 .
5 inches -LRB- 2 inches larger than the ipod -RRB- with a longer battery life by an hour and a removable battery .
so , i can watch widescreen video on a large screen for an hour of additional time than the ipod plus i can have a backup battery to extend my viewing if i so choose did i mention i can record tv , dvds , my own voice , watch a slideshow of my photos with my choice of background music .
the new ipod now has a brighter screen yeah .
it is sad , people will continue to allow apple to fleece them , then again most of you are sheep the archos 604 keeps on giving and giving and giving , while the ipod and itunes store take and take want more reasons to choose an archos 604 , go to www .
archos .
com and read about it .
i am not connected with them in anyway other than i bought and love their products .
it 's nothing special , do not buy into the fad .
i have owned a number of mp3 players and unfortunately bought into the ipod hype .
problems 1 -RRB- if you do n't buy a skin it will scratch up terribly .
if you do buy a skin it makes the wheel very hard to operate 2 -RRB- no bookmarks .
i could n't believe that a unit this expensive does not have bookmarks , but there it is .
if you are listening to a track and leave it for any reason , you have to remember where you were on the album and on the track .
this is a huge problem when listening to audio books .
also , whenever you load anything onto it you lose your place 3 -RRB- the itunes s/w randomly loses music , forcing you reload 4 -RRB- despite what you read in the specs , the best i 've ever gotten from the battery is about 4 hours this is , hands down , the worst player i 've ever bought .
i have purchased 3 ipods so far , most recently the video ipod , and unfortunately that will be my last .
the device works great for a year , then i upgraded the software and now its completely frozen .
apple told me that im out of warranty -LRB- 3 months . -RRB-
and that i could replace it for $ 150 .
they also told me that they were going to charge me for phone support .
i personally think the company has grown too ambitious at the cost of loyal customers .
they obviously put out flawed devices and are not standing behind them .
i would have no problem buying the lastest device every 2 3 years if the product is supported .
has anyone else had this experience .
has apple done anything for you .
i wrote off apple and the ipods five years ago and will never go back .
creative always has superior players and the fact that the .
wma music encoding format is better and sounds closer to the originsl even after compression .
plus the .
wma microsoft format is used on all major music download and streaming services .
stay away from ipods forever .
microsoft holds all the cards and continually will suprass apple on all fronts .
i bought my ipod and ended up selling to a colleague .
from the start i had issues with software ; my music files are on an external hd and the software continuously attempted to move to my notebook hd .
i tried everything , including support -LRB- there is none really -RRB- , then tried with a buddies mac , no problem .
i also don t care for all the proprietary file conversion stuff .
lastly , i could not use while running since the unit would turn off whenever the headphone plug shifted too much .
all in all i am surprised at the product loyalty , i will never by another ipod product .
honestly , why would anybody pay nearly $ 350 for an 80 gb device to play mp3 's , watch movies , and view pictures .
for two times less , you can get four times the space with an external hard drive people do not need any more portable devices ; the market is saturated .
i imagine that apple is only getting purchases since customers are having their older ipod 's break people never learn .
if you really want an mp3 player , go for one of the new sansa 's or creative 's better battery life , file formats , software , and they look so much better .
i got an ipod 5th gen this christmas .
my first ipod ever .
my computer recognized it the very first time i ever plugged it in .
played the ipod for several hours .
now the ipod does not get recognized by computer , nor does it pull a charge .
still under warranty so got it replaced .
second ipod did the exact same thing as the first one .
even tried the whole setup process on a different computer .
these things are pieces of junk .
i will replace this second one with a third because it 's still under warranty but i do not think it will last long at all .
i spent more money in time trying to get these things to work with computers than trying to listen to my music .
thanks for the christmas gift , but i 'd rather have something that will connect to my computer always and get a different brand of mp3 player .
do not buy ipod .
in the last five years apple has sent me 8 ipods because the product keeps breaking and apple does not support the product what so ever .
itunes is a total joke too .
i would strongly recommned you buy something other that an ipod .
every month you will have to download new software which is a memory hog and they also try and get you to down load other apple software -LRB- such as their browser -RRB- .
first of all , it 's made by apple , which is no good .
second , it plays only itune music , which is a total rip off at $ 0 .
99 a song .
if you want a good deal , get a zune .
ipod 's have always had a very intuitive interface thanks to it 's rotating touch pad control but it really ends there and it amazes me why people are so dumb to like these devices the sound quality is inferior to other mp3 players .
itunes is a piece of crap software that slows down your system , is buggy and apple never confirms what they are fixing or putting on your computer just the usual this adds enhancements crap .
apple has n't made a good player , the only thing they 've done good is convining brain dead people that ipods are cool .
to sum it up , i is in a store and a customer asked a sales person , i want the best mp3 player .
he is shown a few really good players and than he responded , no i is talking ipods .
the sales person responded , oh i thought you were looking for the best of the best in mp3 players .
also someone should explain to apple that rechargable batteries wear out after a number of charges , more you plug it in , more your battery is going to lose it 's charge .
do n't they think it 's a good idea that someone who spends hard earned money be able to replace the battery or do they expect them to through it away or use a hair dryer , definately not for bald people who do not have hair dryers .
all ipods suck , when well people learn there much much more better mp3 players out there , apple should just stop trying , they got ta give up already geez , this is the like the 10th ipod atleast .
another ipod .
nothing to write home about a very poor effort compared to the latest competition .
lags behind new competitors like microsoft , creative and toshiba .
particular problems include the tiny screen and lack of support for wma and wmv playback .
i do not know what trash dump is the source of ipod batteries , but scores of them go south .
everybody i know either replaced the damn battery or is having a problem with it .
the batteries will last a little over a year and will go south a few months after your warranty expires .
apple will not stand by their product by replacing the batteries for free .
they will charge you $ 59 for it i will never buy another apple product again .
i bought one of these for my girlfriend and after losing all her music several times , scratching the hell out of it by not doning anything more then just puting it into its supplied case i wanted to chuck it off the roof go with the zen i would put more stalk in user ratings then the other .
and zen is the clear winner -LRB- not zune -RRB- creative labs z e n .
itunes works fine when ipod is not connected but as soon as i connect the ipod , itunes wo n't work .
i do not know what 's the point in spending $ 300 + on something you can not use .
ipod videos are soo over priced i dont know why people are complaining about ps3 's when these are half the price for just a music and video player .
why not get a psp its half the price and has many many more functions than an ipod .
sure the memory sticks are expensive but considering the easy file system and much much larger screen it is for sure worth it .
you see commercials and hear people say how much better apple is than microsoft what is this based on .
not my experience .
i is forced to upgrade my itunes from 6 .
0 to 7 .
2 after buying a new 80g ipod .
it now attempts to analyze gapless playback then immediately freezes .
so i have an 80g paper weight i 've tried everything i can think of and everything suggested on apple .
com .
nothing fixes this .
-LRB- completely uninstalled and then re installed trying 7 .
0 7 .
1 , turned off podcasts , created new user accounts and still have the same freezing -RRB- .
to prove it is the upgrade , i re installed 6 .
0 ; which works .
however , i can not synch my ipod because it requires 7 .
0 or higher finally , i saw a thread on ilounge that says it may be a bug w / itunes and nas 's .
i am using a maxtor shared storage nas and have too many playlists to load directly from my machine .
-LRB- i had no such issues w / itunes 6 .
so , i put a request on apple 's on line support and have heard nothing for 2 days .
i decided to call customer support today .
i am currently on hold my 3rd hour and giving up not sure how you can hold on to your market share if the software to make your player work does not work .
i will be taking my ipod back tomorrow and spending some time on cnet 's reviews to see what options i have for mp3 players .
owned an ipod , loved it , then battery couldnt hold a charge for .
games on it suck .
and um i hope my boss doesnt catch me oh ya creative zen vision m pwns this crappy 5th gen monstrosity .
plus apple , i own a pc and it shreds anything apple can come up with .
so go get a zen vision m cuz if the screen res doesnt blow your brains on the wall , then i dont know what will .
its just 3 weeks old i bought it 's sitting at the apple service center , dont ever go for ipod , when enquired at apple service center , they say after your warranty period , nobody is resp , which unfortunately is just 90 days and no repair can be done instead u go for a new one again so thnk before u invest on a 80gb and also the most important is the life of 80 gb is only 1 .
5 yrs as told by apple .
i hate it , it scratches easy , cracks easy , sometimes just turned off by itself , half the songs didnt work , barely held a charge , it just really sucked .
please for the love of man do not buy an ipod .
sony walkmans are much better than the ipods in every way , what can i say .
your probably thinking this is better becuz it has movies and pictures .
well , thats wrong .
this is more than an audio player , its a super ugly small video viewer and photo viewer .
so why bother watching getting this for those 2 reasons .
so all you have left is the music .
ipods has the worst sound quality on the market out there that i can think of .
the headphones make it even worse .
80 gigs for music -LRB- thats the only thing its good for -RRB- i bet this world doesnt have 80gb of music with aac format .
sony kills this ipod in terms of an audio player .
you have no idea .
the sony headphones model mdr ex51 and higher and unstoppable from other headphones out there .
as soon as i opened up the box and started it , nothing worked .
apple warranty services did not do anything at all to fix the problem nor did they want to fix it or replace it .
recommendations for some people who want to buy the ipod , stick with the microsoft zune .
whether or not you buy this unit do not fall for the ` free engraving ' scam .
the only purpose of apple offering this is to void the 30 day return policy and force you to keep the unit whether or not you like it .
once you get the unit engraved apple declares it an ` open box ' and will not allow it 's return .
if you 're one of those who has a unit with some dead pixels you will be at the mercy of apple who will get to decide whether or not the unit is ` dead enough ' to warrant replacement .
in my case i is sent one as a gift , since my home pc is a win98 one and i can not install any software on my office computer the personalized unit -LRB- my name -RRB- is about to be turned into the world 's most expensive paperweight .
it took threats of legal action and a customer service rep who is willing to ` think outside the box ' to get them to agree to return the unit -LRB- i had to pay for the return but i guess having to pay $ 15 to return an unusuable birthday gift is better than having to stick this thing into a drawer -RRB- .

And lots of extras , you think about it and someone has done -LRB- Waterproof Cases for swimming w / your Ipod -RRB- .
; I do n't like mixing my audio podcasts and music , that is what the sub-cat podcasts are for .
And the inabilitiy to label audio , audio-book for the audio sub cat .
Ca n't take mp3 's off of the Ipod easy The best thing about this product is you really get to know Fed Ex because you will be sending it back to Apple every other month when it breaks ; Customer Support whether it be in the store or via the phone is pathetic .
I only use my ipod for music and the product and the headphones which come with the product are as bad as it could get .
On the plus side of this player it has a LOT of space to put files .
I like the controlls mostly because I 'm used to my old iPod so it 's second nature .
It also has great sound .
The headphones are good. ; The only bad thing I can find about this product is the battery life .
I find myself feeling like it could use a little more capacity .
Completely moddable , everything that you dont like can be fixed through installing Rockbox , and IpodLinux -LRB- easy install btw -RRB- , with the ability to still access the Apple Firmware , it becomes a all in one -LRB- minus the camera -RRB- ; The default apple firmware really downplays the power of the player , also since its old , its not supported very well on itunes anymore
