Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Nothing I've found yet. 
Summary:. Can anyone explain why CNET has listed this TV's specs under the "LCD Backlight Technology" row as having "Wide Color Gamut-CCFL" instead of "LED Backlight technology" like all the other sets listed under this LED TV discussion? Is it just a missprint?. http://reviews.cnet.com/4321-6482_7-6661380.html?tag=centerColumnArea1.2. Updated. on Sep 30, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Unbelievably good picture quality. Reflections are not an issue. Not that much more expensive than the other similar sets. One of the best purchases I've ever made.. 
Cons:. There is nothing about this set I don't like.. 
Summary:. This set shown out from all the others in the shop. At home it is PURRRFECT. Like the Queen song "I'm in love with my car", I'm shamelessly in love with my TV. I did a lot of research. I did make sure it was one with the update. My biggest worry was that the reflections might drive me crazy. Even with a bright environment it is not an issue for me. I'd like to plug CNET as the best tool for consumers around as well-- even though I don't always agree with their analysis, product after product I can find no better work out there.. 

$$;

Cons:. none yet. no bugs at this time !. 
Summary:. great LCD best in the mexican market, feel proud to buy a product that's made in mexico. 

$$;
Pros:. best lcd on the market under $6,000. 
Cons:. one of the most expensive tv's on the market. 
Summary:. bought it for $2,300 in dec,2008. was looking to trade up from my 42" toshiba and was looking into a pioneer elite plasma($5,000) or a a sony led lcd ($5,000) but got a great deal on this 950 + at the store standing side by side by side with all three i think the pioneer looked a little better than the 950 but not by much. the sony was just a little below compared to the 950. but when i got a deal on the 950 for half the price of the pioneer elite i ran away with the 950. i love it especially compared to my 42" toshiba lcd. the picture quality is by far one of the best if not the best tv at that price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Crystal Clear display, Movies, Games, Sports look great with no problems. The audio is not bad by itself, too.. 
Cons:. Haven't experienced any problems yet (knock on wood).. 

$$;
Pros:. I loved the fact that it is so light (30kg, or about 70 lbs, including stand). The connectivity; HD TV shows and movies are so clear, it is like you are there .. I got the LA46A950 for Australia, which is the same TV with minor regional diffs.. 
Cons:. Yet to see the value in DLNA, the 'standards-based' system for sharing content on your network with your TV.. 
Summary:. One of the best ways to spend $US 3 grand I know.. 

$$;
Pros:. Phenominal picture, almost 3-D looking; extremely clear. 
Cons:. Price...... 
Summary:. I struggled back and forth between looking at the 46" 950 and the 52" 750 models and finally decided on the 950. Once I got it home and set it up (took only about 10 minutes, did it during halftime!), I was giddy as a schoolgirl! The clarity is outstanding and the colors are more real than anything I've seen before! While on the pricey side for a 46" LCD TV, if you can afford the extra, you will NOT be disappointed! I made the right decision going with the 950...not that the 750 wouldn't have been a great alternative, but the 950 is out of this world. Even my wife, who couldn't care less about what TV she watched, has made numerous comments on how realistic the picture is. It is almost as if you are watching through a window rather than a TV screen!. 

$$;
Pros:. crystal clear picture! hate watching other tv's.. ease of use, i was able to set up perfect only to waste money on the geek squad.. 
Cons:. none noted so far.. 
Summary:. i had a hard time with buying my tv reading all of the reviews. i went to best buy for 3 hours trying to find another tv that was better. i have had it for two weeks and no regreats at all. well worth the price, you'll see.. 

$$;
Pros:. this tv has the best led back light better than sony and Lg. 
Cons:. best picture on any tv i have seen. 
Summary:. Best TV on the market right now for the price. Get one while you can!". 

$$;
Pros:. Pros: The tv itself is stunning. The picture quality is equal to that of even the new Pioneer Kuro.. 
Cons:. A bit pricy, but considering the soon to come competition, this tv is going to be a bargain.. 
Summary:. "Every year a new piece of technology comes out and makes last year's equipment outdated. Well, I had just bought the 81f (last year's top model) and then came across this beauty in the store. Why did I choose this tv?. 1. I will put my money towards a Samsung product any day. Sony products look nice, but you end up paying more for the name.. 2. The tv can render images that you might think can only be done with 120mhz refresh, but yet somehow this tv with the 120 turned off still renders amazing views.. 3. The tv can reach black levels that no other lcd can. Given, there are new lcds coming in a month or more that will compete and they will boast a 200mhz or greater refresh rate. But, they will cost at least 1k more.. 4. I am not a big fan of the 120 mhz refresh rate, but since I can turn it off and have near Plasma tv like imagery, I find myself more than happy with this tv. Also, the 120 and above refresh rates really bother my eyes. It might sound odd, but I can catch the tv while it does that and it bothers me for some reason. Given, 120 allows for some amazing images, it just is not for me.. To summarize my poorly written review, I must say that this is the best tv out there right now. The other televisions that will soon be arriving stateside will boast the same tech and might have some shiny new gadgets, but from what I have seen from IFA this is going to be in the top three list for tvs in 2008-2009.. One last thing. The pre-loaded content and the RSS feeds are nice but not noteworthy. Buy this tv for its' amazing picture quality and great technology. 

$$;
Pros:. The best picture quality, deepest blacks, and richest colors I have seen. Good looking design. Great Color. 
Cons:. Found none yet!. 
Summary:. This thing is giving the all-to-expensive Pioneer Elite a run for its money...and it's a LCD. I just picked this up at a Best Buy/Magnolia in the DC/Baltimore area. Found these guys to be real helpful too. If any of you read this, thanks again!. I am so happy that I waited for this LCD to come out. I have always LOVED Samsung, and this just makes me love them even more!. 

$$;
Pros:. Color is flawless. Blacks are so deep. Way punchier and sharper than any plasma on the market including the Pioneer Elites.. 
Cons:. Slight off axis fading, but not bad.. 
Summary:. Amazing. Updated. on Sep 15, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture -AMAZING... I was told from Electronic stores that this TV was price protected at 3,100 but was able to get an amazing price at an authorized Samsung dealer at $1,000 off the retail price. If you have the money for this LCD well worth it.. 
Cons:. TV bulky from the back. 

$$;
Pros:. Super clear picture-use as my bedroom TV mainly at night, but the picture is still razor sharp in full daylight.. 
Cons:. The musical chime on power on/off is cute at first. I'll have to crack the manual to learn how to shut it off. Also, there is a conflict between my HD cable box and the TV--the cable remote won't work when the TV is on.. 
Summary:. We got a great deal on this set at Best Buy in December 2008. The TV, free entry level Samsung Blu-Ray player, in-home wall mounting and installation, 4 year service contract, and sales tax all for $2500. Only additional expense was the mounting bracket and we got the same one Best Buy offered at Target for 10% less.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fabulous display, slick understated design.. 
Cons:. Expensive, believe movies look better on PDP in general.. 
Summary:. No regrets on my choice but will perhaps buy another HDTV Plasma set to watch movies. Stunning digital display.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image quality, LED backlighting, good sound, lots of inputs. 
Cons:. Expensive :(. 
Summary:. This TV looks great. Almost no image blur, even in fast movie scenes. The LED backlighting does wonders for the picture quality. Definitely one of the best LCD TVs on the market today. So if you can afford it, you won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Less motion blurr. Nice black levels. 
Cons:. I can't find one yet.. 
Summary:. I saw one in a store and found that the picture quality was pretty good. The motion blur that you would normally find in a LCD was kept to a minimal and the colours looked very accurate. The Samsung series 9 really stood out up against the rest. I like the frame as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Colors really stand out above any display I have ever seen, picture is perfectly sharp and the settings are endless when it comes to brightness and contrast. 24p material looks great as long as it is viewed without AMP and at 24hz.. 
Cons:. Auto Motion Plus is still strange looking unless you are watching sports where it does a really nice job. My eyes feel strained after watching, but been watching a few too many hours which might be the cause.. 
Summary:. The LN46A950 has so far been a fantastic TV for me. The colors are truly beautiful, especially noticeable from HD titles with masterful lighting and white balance like "The Departed". The brightness is also amazing and can be adjusted for viewing in the daytime or at night while looking amazing either which way. Xbox360, PS3 and Computer output is great with settings that will suit each experience whether it is twitch gaming, slower paced role playing games or Movies from Marketplaces or HD Sources such as Blu Ray or HDDVD.. My only real complaint is that AMP didn't end up being as good as I had hoped from the demos I saw. The technology is amazing but seems to be only suited for Live Programs with a lot of action. HD Football and Basketball games look amazing with smoothing turned on but movies and tv dramas look strange and unnatural. I can't really see the technology getting any better unless it can somehow find action in the screen and kick on only during those times.. Couldn't find any specs that said that this tv does 5:5 pulldown, although logically it seems it would have to. Regardless, 24p content looks amazing whichever way it is being done.. Updated. on Sep 26, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Good quality output. 
Cons:. The price/performance ratio. 
Summary:. At 2 or 3 to 1 price ratio against other LCD display at 46 inch, I fail to see the real advantage of this unit against other units unless money is no object. But it's that's the case, why would you go with a 46 inch unit versus much larger units at 65 inches or bigger. Deep black level is a spec way overblown by the vendors and the media.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent picture. LED backlighting. 
Cons:. price. excessive blooming. terrible off axis viewing. screen and frame are like a mirror. 
Summary:. I tried 3 and had to return them all due to excessive blooming. and screen uniformity problems. 

$$;
Pros:. Light and easy to handle. 
Cons:. Washed out despite tweaking. Had to turn backlight right off or to the 1 setting to get non washed out blacks. Overall colour faded.. 
Summary:. Future Shop says to expect more Mexican built Samsung product from Samsung. If this is the case: Samsung - hasta la vista! Please get me a S panel. A panels are an insult and rip off to the North American consumer!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture. 
Cons:. Poor sound. 
Summary:. This TV should not be allowed on the market. Although the picture is of top quality, the sound from it is poor. For this price Samsung should be able to do better.. 

$$;
Pros:. I liked it when it was working fantastic pic. 
Cons:. its not working any more for less than 1 months!!!!!.
