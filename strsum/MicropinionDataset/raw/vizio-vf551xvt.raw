Pros:. Perfect for head on gaming and TV viewing, and add a PC with a wireless Keybord. Who need APPs?. 
Cons:. Need 2 people to pick it up.. 
Summary:. This is my 4th Vizio product 22, 32, 37, and now a 55 I bought Vizo for my KIds Rooms/ College and The Basement For My TV room With a Big L shape Couch Samsung 52 B750. just like cnet told me to do. Enjoy this Big 55 Inch with a Play Station 3. 

$$;
Pros:. matted screen, picture quality, style, LED. Side menus. 
Cons:. Gamma adjustments. No upgrade for 3D. A few more adjustments. Video-camera like smooth-motion.. 
Summary:. I have had this TV for almost 3 months. I have been trying to find a better value and have had a very tough time. After using the CNet recommended adjustments, but increasing the backlighting to 50/55 makes the picture that much better. Standard is pretty good for sports as well. The matted screen is a must near my bay window and white walls. It makes the picture viewable during the daytime, which I had problems with with my old tube tv.. I have compared this TV vs. the Samsung 55B6000 and LG 55LH90. The Samsung picture did not seem as realistic, and the glossy screen was an issue, as well as off-angle viewing. The LG's picture was virtually identical to the Vizio's, but the form-factor was much more bulky and bulbus vs. the Vizio's.. The sound is good for a TV. Obviously, a sound system will sound better, but for a stand-alone unit, it is actually pretty good.. Occasional color-bleeding, but it is rare. Smooth motion does occasionally look video-camera like, and sometimes it is neccessary with action movies, such as the Matrix Reloaded.. I like that the menus do not take over the entire screen like most tvs. It is relatively easy to navigate.. 

$$;
Pros:. The 240hz vs. the 120hz on the Vizio VF550 is stellar! so far, no pixelated trailers as on the VF550,. Of course the LED vs. the LCD on the VF550 is another wonderful addition.. Glad I spent the add'l $ for the BEST 'bang for your buck' on a 55" set.. 
Cons:. NOTHING TO REPORT AT THIS TIME!. 
Summary:. For your money, if you're looking for a 55" set, you'll be hard pressed to find a set of this quality.. I own a Sony 32" HDTV and a Samsung 40" HDTV as well... I paid for the names!. The Vizio is far and away a much better picture.... Vizio offer Much, Much more in the way of options for adjustment to picture and sound.. I say "GO NOW, BUY A VIZIO!". They prove their claim to be 'America's #1 Tv'. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is just amazing. Great price and Costco customer support is wonderful.. 
Cons:. Slightly thick, not too bad though. No local dimming on VGA port.. 
Summary:. I purchased this TV about one month ago and haven't looked at any others. After setting everything up I changed the picture settings to those used by Cnet's reviewers and I'm very happy. I would recommend though to turn up the backlight setting to around 45-50 because Cnet's recommendation is a bit dim for my viewing preferences. In reference to the VGA port, there doesn't appear to be a local or "smart" dimming option for this port. My Xbox360 uses the VGA port for 1080p display and its a shame I cannot take advantage of the local dimming. Other than that, I love this TV and would recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price is right! 1/2 the price of comparable sets. And personally like the picture better then the samsungs. PIP is a great feature. 
Cons:. a lil thick but no big deal. 

$$;
Pros:. Great color. Amazing blacks. Excellent sound. Great motion rendering.. 
Cons:. The remote control melted when my dad put the batteries in. Literally, it melted.. 
Summary:. For the price, this seems to be the best 55" on the market. I've found the blacks to be amazing, the colors very vibrant, the sound is surprisingly good. I'm very impressed with the 4 HDMI ports plus all the others. Very, very flexible.. We got it from Costco for $1899, which seems to be a very good price for this model. I waited about two weeks for the north Austin, Texas Costco to get them in stock. I called Saturday morning and they finally got eight of them. I wound up not getting to the store until about 5 and I got the last one on the shelf! These things seem to be selling like hotcakes!. The only odd thing is that when we were setting the TV up, my dad popped the batteries into the remote and set it aside. About 15-20 minutes later when I was ready to use the remote to set the TV up, I grabbed the remote and it was very hot to the touch. The front of the remote had melted and it didn't work. I popped the batteries out but they were so hot I dropped them. My dad worked in the cable and satellite TV industry for about 35 years, and he is positive that he put the batteries in the right way. Even if he didn't - no modern battery-powered electronic device should be susceptible to damage from reversed batteries, especially to the point where the device melts! The good news is that Vizio tech support gave me zero problems and are shipping me a new one. They also talked me through configuration without the remote. I am very happy with the resolution of this problem.. Bottom line is that I am very happy with this TV so far. Ignoring the low-cost attribute, it's a stellar TV. Add in the fact that it's about half the price of some competitive TVs, and it's a no-brainer. This TV rocks!. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture, out of the box, with no fiddling, is amazing. Unlike some so-called reviewers who have only looked at the picture in the store, I've owned it for almost 2 months. The picture quality is better than anything I've seen.. 
Cons:. My son finds the "lack of blurring" to be distracting. Seriously. The depth of field on hi-def sources takes some getting used to. It's so clear as compared to anything I've ever seen, it takes some getting used to.. 
Summary:. I don't find the physical appearance of the set to be an issue. The icons that light up on the lower left side are a distraction at first, but since they light up when the set is on, if it is sitting in the "on" position with no video source, it actually helps me tell that it is indeed on. So that's useful. I waited over 5 months for this set to be available and I've not been disappointed. I decided not to wait for the next version with widgits. No problem, turns out that we can plug my son's MacBook Pro into the set and show all kinds of internet content, and it looks great. I'm not going to put down competing products, other than to say that I really don't know why someone would want to pay $7-800 more, for similar or even less technology.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge Screen, Not a lot of glare, great picture and sound, great price.. 
Cons:. TV is a bit thick, certainly not the thinnest TV.. 
Summary:. I bought a Panny 54 inch Plasma from Costco that I wasn't very happy with, so I took it back and bought this VF551XVT instead. The TV is breathtaking. The picture is one of the VERY best I've ever seen, it looked better than the 1080p Sony that it was displayed next to. With the Panny, the picture looked decent when connected to DirectTV HD receiver, but it didn't have that 3D look when watching my BluRay player. I was really dissappointed, even though I've always liked Panasonic Plasmas. I won't be returning this Vizio, that's for sure. When watching HD TV, the picture is even better than the plasma. Super sharp, like you're looking through a window. The colors look great, the blacks look as dark as the Panny (thanks to LED backlighting, or TRULED as Vizio calls it), and the sound is far superior to the plasma as well. BluRay is like a whole new experience on this TV. Even my wife couldn't believe how sharp and defined the movies look. Definately has that "3D effect" that the Panny didn't have.. The only dislikes? It's pretty thick, and the VIZIO symbol that lights white under the screen cannot be turned off. Small price to pay for such a great TV at a previously unattainable price.. Overall, I highly recommend this TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unreal PQ - almost 3D on good HDTV and Bluray sources. Black levels that rival my friends Kuro Plasma. Colors are richer from LED backlight system. Very happy with this purchase below $2K.. 
Cons:. None that I can find yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. The product specs are very impressive and compare with far more expensive sets. Out of the box, it does not disappoint.. 
Cons:. A little heavy compared to some other comparable sets.. 
Summary:. I'd been waiting awhile for this TV to be available to be purchased locally. It arrived in my local Costco in Clearwater, Florida and I was immediately convinced this was my next TV as soon as I saw it. I bought it and had it delivered. I got it out of the box and connected to my devices. The 2M:1 contrast ratio and 240Hz refresh rate are delivered as advertised. I am equally impressed with its performance with Blu Ray movies, DirecTV HD, and video games. I was considering the Samsung 8500, but I am very satisfied with my decision to purchase this set instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Today I went to the Tustin, CA Costco and saw the new Vizio VF551XVT on display next to the VF550XVT. The VF551XVT is going for $1999 while the older model is $500 less.The picture looked beautiful, vibrant colors, no noticeable blurs.. 
Cons:. Didn't see any.. 
Summary:. Finally a LED 55 inch 240Hz for less than two grand. It has a silver color sound bar at the bottom of the display. Can't wait to purchase one, although my wife tells me to wait for the VF552XVT coming out in December that has Internet content.. Updated. on Nov 14, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Love sound and refresh action. 
Cons:. None all sound great. 

$$;
Pros:. Great looking set, love the specs listed. 
Cons:. speaker bar is getto chrome on the first 55" model, this one was shown in red a little tacking they need to paint it black. 
Summary:. I would buy set providing speaker bar if fixed. Wife will not allow it i the house in red or chrome. OH Well. 

$$;
Pros:. It's the only TV that Costco is not afraid to have on showing nothing but regular broadcast television while all their other TV's on the standard high-def Blue Ray/DVD loop and the Vizio looks BETTER! Guess what I'm getting for my living room!. 
Cons:. Costco cannot keep up with demand on this product which at my Costco is being sold for 1799.99 and comes internet-ready and with a bluetooth remote. When they have stock, it doesn't last long.. 
Summary:. Until I go to CES next January, this will be without question the best under $2000 TV I will see this year. I don't even think the traditional Black Friday TV's can top this value!. 

$$;
Pros:. Slick look with great picture. 
Cons:. None to mention. 
Summary:. We installed this model today for a customer and it is awesome. They used this service www.zipinstallation.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Inky blacks. Bright whites. Great color and detail. Amazing smooth motion processing (yes I'm one of the freaks that actually likes the way it looks). Nice remote. Big screen and a great picture for the money.. 
Cons:. housing has minor imperfections when you look at it from an angle - making it look slightly cheaper than the Sony and Samsung sets. Speaker bar looks so so and I dislike like the chrome bits between the screen and the speaker bar. 
Summary:. Ok, on to the picture quality of my 551 vs my 550,,, in a nutshell, the 551 is a big jump in PQ and in my opinion very much worth the upgrade,,,,, or, if your between getting the 550 or a 551,, spend the extra money and get the 551 !!!!!. I put on the "Coraline" BD to see how it compared with the Samsung 8000 I watched it on the day before and the 551 held it's own in comparrison to the Sammy 8000,,,, the 3D look, the colors, the black's, everything looks great on the 551 and without the glossy screen of the Samsung 8000.. So far I have spent the entire night playing my favorite BD's on the Vizio 551 and I gota say I am really knocked out. I was kinda thinkin I would wait and check out the Vizio 552 with all the widgets and internet stuff, but then I got to thinkin, am I really going to use any of that stuff? Perhaps not. I have a computer 10' away from my TV, if Im watching a movie Im watching a movie, not doing FaceBook or emails,,, beside's, I have a DVR and video on demand, and not to mention all the BD players that are out and coming out that all have those features.. As those features grow and change and expand I figure its alott cheaper to buy a new BD player than a new TV,,, that's another reason I figured it was a stupid idea (for me) to wait for the 552.. Anyhow, in closing I just gota say I am so very glad I decided to get the Vizio 551, for me, to my eye's and in my opinion the PQ of the 551 blows away the 550. 

$$;
Pros:. Dear Vizio Customer,. Thanks for showing interest in VIZIO TV.. The VF551XVT will begin shipping in end July to the following retailers:. Costco. Sam's. BJ's.. 
Cons:. NONE to tell of yet. 

$$;
Pros:. very good picture, easy to tweak to your viewing . remote is somewhat poor as you cannot use it to adjust volume on your reciever. so ue still have to have 2 remotes, of course my Harmoney 880 works just fine.. 
Cons:. the backlight went out after 7 months . I have spent the past day an a half trying to fax them proof of purchase even though it was registered.this to them but all I get is a busy signal. If they are this busy what this say about product reliability.. 
Summary:. I gave them 4 stars only that while my tv was working it had a great almost 3d effect picture. . There service is wanting. As half way thru the second day I still have not been able to acess thier fax machine.. still trying!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, Inputs, PIP/POP feature. 
Cons:. Audio stability. 
Summary:. Just received this TV as ur first HDTV in the house and overall I am pleased with the performance. The picture is great on HD and BlueRay programming. Pretty fuzzy/blury when viewing analog stations, but I guess that is expected. On the downside... I was not able to program any of the other components we have to the Vizio Remote, which was disappointing, but we have other remotes. I have also been very disappointed on the audio level stability. This TV was rated very good on audio and the ability to keep the sound at one level (with the option turned on), but this is not my experience with the TV, it seems to vary quite a bit between regular programming and commercials (we have DirecTV). Overall a great HDTV, only disappointed in the Audio... Hate having to turn the volume up and down all the time. Need to fix that Vizio... 

$$;
Pros:. Glare is not a problem, great SD quality, Over all HD video is excellent.. 
Cons:. Speakers are pretty weak, remote isn't that great.. 
Summary:. Over all I'm very pleased with this TV set. Before I installed my Directv HD DVR I was watching all my shows in standard Def, and was quite surprised at how good it looked. Now that I am on 1080p...WOW!. 

$$;
Pros:. The specs of this tv look great, it could definitely be something I would purchase. led lcd and 1000000:1 aspect ration and 240 hz. all of this for $2000!. 
Cons:. The red bar needs be be taken off! this is such a classy tv, why would you put that ugly cheap looking red on it. Make it black or like the current model.. 
Summary:. I am planning on waiting until this comes out to buy a new tv. if the red bar is on it i will most likely not purchase. if anyone from vizio is reading this please save this tv! take the red bar off. everything i have read thus far is great about the tv except for the red bar. this could be something great!. Updated. on Mar 26, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. This is just what I have been waiting for. Great price.. 
Cons:. I agree with the previous poster. The red bar is very tacky and needs to be painted black. The chrome will also be very distracting. Keep everything black for optimal viewing.. 

$$;
Pros:. after reading reviews i am not sure where is this red everyone is talking about? Just got back from Sams club they have VF551XVT2A model does anyone know what the difference is from the cnet model VF551XVT It did not have the widgets on the screen.. 
Cons:. but it did have 1 USB Multimedia Input guess you can connect pc here, it had PIP and Picture-outside-Picture (POP) can someone tell me what that is. 

$$;
Pros:. Price is good, sometimes the picture looks good, other times it's just ok.. 
Cons:. The picture seems grainy on both HD and SD. Wii works but I get columns of missing pixels.. 
Summary:. My neighbor has Samsung LN55B650 (120 Hz and Not LED). Her set looks better. The picture on her set has that deep black and saturated colors feel to it. We both viewed my set and thought it was not as good on HD, and way worse on SD. Wii works fine on hers.. We both have Charter cable. We both have HDTV receivers from charter, but different models, mine receiver is 2 years old not sure if an updated model would help. We both have HDMI cable from receiver to TV.. I am still not ruling out something on my side. I have my cable going to a splitter, so maybe a weak signal is the issue? I played with all the settings and improved the picture somewhat but still seems to be missing that crystal clear 3-D pop that I see in my neighbors set. I'll try plugging the coax directly in to the TV (I think charter does not encrypt local HD) and see if the picture improves (ruling out the receiver as an issue).. Updated. on Jan 29, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. better blacks then the Cold cathode lighting. 
Cons:. this is not an LED tv, leds are cheaper then the old way of backlighting so why should i pay more???. 
Summary:. pretty much just wait for a real LED tv or the prices on the LCD backlit with led's comes down. 

$$;
Pros:. Should be awesome when it arrives.... 
Cons:. ...called Vizio and they are now (May 2009) projecting a wait until September 2009 for this product. These things have a way of stretching out.... 
Summary:. Check out the dropping prices on the VF550XVT...not the same TV, I grant you, but the projections of May/June seem to have fallen by the wayside. Good values to be had right now.. Updated. on Oct 11, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. So far so good except one major issue :(. 
Cons:. While watching VF552XVT, after some random time it gets switched off - sometimes within minutes; sometimes within hours !!! I bought it only a month ago :(. 

$$;
Pros:. Multiple HDMI hook-ups, excellent picture quality, easy to manipulate remote, $1,200 less than the comprable Samsung.. 
Cons:. It is a few inches thicker than the Samsung, but since I am not mounting it on the wall, it was a non issue. Silver sound bar on bottom takes a little getting used to, but it is definately not a deal breaker.. 
Summary:. Most features and benefits for the money. I watch a lot of sports and contemplated this set, the Samsung 8000 series, and even a Panasonic Plasma. When Costco knocked an additional $300 off, I could not justify the $1,200 price difference with the Samsung. Picture is phenominal, remote is easy to manipulate, and with my surround sound system, Blue Ray DVD's are awesome. I read dozens of customer and expert reviews and comparisons to the Samsung and other than a few aesthetics, the reviews were pretty similar. Also, Costco gives an additional two year warranty!. Updated. on Mar 21, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality excellent. 
Cons:. This tv ruined my xmas, new led tv 55 in from vizio turned off and will not turn back on. Tech support says Oh that's not good and advised it would be 3 to 5 days before anyone would come out to fix it. I purchased it 1 week ago.. 
Summary:. great quality on HD channels, poor quaility and a thin line at the top on standard channels. and Poor response time on repair.. 

$$;
Pros:. great price point for the features. would definately buy, but...... 
Cons:. LOSE THE RED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it looks horrible on the Samsung's and even worse on this Vizio. Will not buy with any RED on my tv..
