we 've been regulars here for years with over 20 visits but we 've seen standards drop and complacency set in .
this year , especially .
although there are a few polite , lovely and welcoming staff , i 'm afraid most are rude , especially the 'security ' staff who have become more and more aggressive and unfriendly to guests and owners .
my son although previously happy at balaia is now so upset by rude security staff that he does n't want to visit again .
a sentiment we 've witnessed with others .
you get the distinct impression that guests , especially from britain are tolerated rather than welcome , sometimes not even tolerated .
this was not always the case .
in terms of golf , we 've seen the standards of upkeep on the range and public areas drop , dress codes fastidiously applied to overseas visitors do n't appear to be applied to locals ( with children allowed to play on the greens and bunkers in the evenings ) , and i really do n't understand why balaia refuses to compete with the great golf deals on offer at the magnificent oceanico courses locally , where you can often play for much less money than at balaia and with far superior facilities and golf .
although good location and layout , the standard of accommodation in the apartments is rather low spec and dated .
we have been loyal regulars for years but wake up balaia , and sort yourselves out .
we will not be returning , ever , and i strongly suggest you readers do n't bother . . .

try other golf resorts where standards and service are much higher and guests are genuinely welcomed !
