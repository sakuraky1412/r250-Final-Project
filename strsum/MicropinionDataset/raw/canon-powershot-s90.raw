Pros:. this is great product. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. this is great product. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent low-light performance. Wide-angle lens. Realistic, subtle detail in pictures. Easy manual control of shutter speed, aperture, and sensitivity ("ISO" speed). Great user interface. Large display for viewing pictures.. 
Cons:. After four months of use, the camera's strengths are so significant that any weaknesses seem trivial. A metal door (instead of plastic) over the jack used to connect the camera to my PC would be nice, but with reasonable care it is no problem.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera based upon David Pogue's review online. If you are considering buying this camera, I suggest you read his review too. I wanted a camera that would take excellent pictures indoors without flash. This camera does that very well -- much better than my last camera, which I thought was good. I wanted a camera with a wide-angle lens to capture everything indoors. This camera does that very well. I was relatively unconcerned about full manual control of aperture, shutter speed, etc. But I have discovered that the user interface on this camera makes it so easy to dial in the settings I want that I am now using manual control for all my pictures, getting the best pictures ever, and loving every minute of it. Although the camera is slightly thicker around the lens than my last camera, I can still easily put this camera in my pants pocket.. I have had to use every camera I have owned for a while to get so familiar with the controls that I don't have to think about them. That is true for this camera too. But the wonderful thing is that the more I use the camera, the more I discover about the features it offers and how easy it is to use them. For example, I recently learned that I can choose an alternate set of display characteristics that are accessible with the push of a button. I have chosen to have the screen divided into thirds horizontally and vertically, making it easier to attractively compose pictures. And I can turn this on or off with the push of a button. Some things that initially seemed awkward now seem to work very well.. One great thing about this camera that I have not seen in other reviews is that it remembers the way I want it to work. For example, I choose to have the flash turned off all the time as my normal way of operating. This camera remembers that. My last camera required me to manually turn off the flash every time I turned on the camera, which was annoying, and I occasionally forgot to do this, with irritating consequences. It's wonderful to have this camera ready to go the way I want it to go as soon as I turn it on.. One peculiar thing is that when the camera is set to automatically control the exposure, it seems that my efforts to increase or decrease the exposure by a couple of F stops do not have as great an effect as I would expect -- as if the camera is trying to keep me out of trouble. In some cases, this was frustrating, but I am now using full manual choice of the settings, so it is no problem.. Another peculiar thing is that sometimes the image on the screen is darker when I shoot the picture than when I view the picture after it has been shot. I am learning to compensate for this, and it is not a serious problem, but I think Canon could improve this a bit.. In general, this camera takes wonderful pictures easily and automatically, and it is also very easy to manually control -- it just takes some time and practice to get familiar with it. The more I use it, the better I like it. People who look at the pictures I take are usually blown away by them. And so am I..

Pros:. ring around lens. 
Cons:. no HD video.

Pros:. -Super fast f2 lens. -Excellent low light shots. -spot on colors. -great advanced feature set. -easy functionality. 
Cons:. -no HD move (who cares!). -back control dial can be a bit flimsy. 
Summary:. I am currently own a Nikon dSLR and have had when it was time to buy a new P&#38;S I first went to Nikon. Finding nothing that I liked, I decided upon the S90 and couldn't be happier! I do a great deal of HDR work, and let me tell you, this can get you some astonishing results! The colors are extremely accurate and the autobracketing feature works like a charm.. My favorite part is definitely the f2 lens. I can get outstanding low light shots without having to sacrifice and move to a higher ISO. Speaking of ISO, this is th most noise free I have ever seen a P&#38;S. Pictures are usuable in large print all the way up to ISO 800, and the fact that it can expand to 3200 is great for very low light, however you will see a decent amount of noise.. I could not be any happier with my choice. If you are looking for a simple P&#38;S to take to family functions and aren't really into photography, I suggest that you save yourself a few bucks and get the SD780 or SD1200. But for serious photographers out there, or simply someone who wants to enhance their photography skills but not throw down big dollars for a dSLR, then I HIGHLY recommend this camera!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I've had this camera for just over an hour and I'm already AMAZED with what it can do. Low light setting is fantastic, menu and settings are intuitive, very comfortable and easy to use immediately, but seems expansive enough that it will grow with me. 
Cons:. Flash placement is directly where your fingers go to hold the camera, but can be easily compensated.. Recommend buying the special grip designed for this camera, and possibly an adjustable wrist strap.. 
Summary:. Wow. How do I love thee, Canon Powershot S90? Let me count the ways.. I've been a fan of photography for a long time (started with an all-manual Pentax K1000) but I'm really just a novice so I need my camera to think for me when I can't remember which aperture number I need for low light and I really want the shot. The point-n-shoot cameras I've had in the past were frustrating because either I couldn't figure out how to set them up or get them to the settings I wanted, or they were too darn slow. The S90 is quick on start-up and pretty good on shot-to-shot time (much better than my previous cameras, but still not SLR speed - - none of them can be).. While I agree that the flash placement is a bit odd, I've already adjusted to it and it's really not a problem. Good idea to order the grip for it, as well as an adjustable wrist strap, but if those are the worst things about the camera then it's a really great camera!. The loose dial on the back of the camera that other reviews point out isn't really much of an issue. In fact, it's kind of nice to be able to quickly scroll through the menu selections. Again, with the special grip this really won't be an issue for most users.. I have a Rebel XT that I really like, and have owned several point-n-shoot cameras from other manufacturers but I wanted a good shooter to take where an SLR might not comfortably go. So far I've played with all the features and it's very intuitive. It has all the auto features you might want for those friends/family/pet shots, but lots of creative options to play with when you're in the mood for it. Very comfortable, but sturdy. The low light setting is AMAZING!!. This camera is really intuitive for the novice user, but advanced enough to satisfy the photography student or advanced amateur looking for ways to practice their craft without the cumbersome bulk of an SLR. In fact, it was a professional photographer who recommended it to me as the only camera to buy. I'm already in love with this little machine and can't wait to get back to playing with it. Happy shooting!. 

$$;
Pros:. Almost all the features of a G11 in a pocket size camera. Beginners can easily learn to take advantage of many advanced functions to improve their pictures considerably. Best low light and night landscapes portraits I've seen for the size.. 
Cons:. The little wheel is too sensitive but you get used to it.. 
Summary:. If the only thing stopping you from buying a. DSLR or semi-advance camera is that it is not pocket size, the s90 is the best option by far. Also for curious beginners this camera is a good introduction to more advance features that pays off with much better pics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Photo quality is awesome for a "point and shoot". Manual settings expand your options for taking different shots. Low light shots are really cool, make the photos more natural and not blasted with a flash. Want simple? Put it on AUTO and snap away!. 
Cons:. Expensive, but hey get the accidental insurance from Best Buy or where ever you purchase it and your covered. HD video would be nice, but the standard video looks great and works fine for YouTube or home movies.. 
Summary:. Check out the Canon Powershot S90 group on Flickr, for examples of great looking photos!. 

$$;
Pros:. Canon S90 takes great indoor pictures without a flash. This is great with a three week old grandchild with sensitive eyes. The small size makes it easy to carry in a pocket. Image quality is better than any compact camera I've ever seen.. 
Cons:. Initial price. 
Summary:. I like to have a camera close at all times and be able to get high quality pictures. This camera is just right for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. It fits in my pocket. Fast adjustments due to two dials(lensring and at the back) and customizable button.. Fast lens.. 
Cons:. No optical viewfinder.. When holding the camera, I sometimes block the popup flash.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of features - options from fully AUTO to Manual; easy-to-use controls; easy-to-understand menus; beautiful 3" LCD; optical stabilizer; small &#38; slender to fit in a purse or pocket; 10MP is more than enough resolution. 
Cons:. nothing yet. 

$$;
Pros:. The 2 simple function wheels that default intelligently, but which can still be changed, are the best thought out user interface of any camera I have ever used.. Going back down to 10 MP shows that Canon understands real photographer's needs. 
Cons:. I would have liked a small grip on the front of the camera. It would have not disrupted the overall size, because the front function ring already goes out 1/4 inch. I like the more secure feel of a grip - but that is really a personal preferrence. 
Summary:. I have been waiting for a camera like this for a long time. I am a semi-pro photographer. I am, and have always been a Nikon guy for my SLRs. However, Canon has always been my camera of choice for point-and-shoot cameras.. I like the image quality and functional design of the Canon point-and-shoot cameras better. The challenge that I had is that the ever increasing MP insanity started to reduce the quality of the images even on the Canons.. When I first read the promo information about this camera I couldn't believe that a camera company had finally stopped the insanity. The reduction of the MP and the slight image sensor size increase have really paid off.. I just bought the camera yesterday and I have taken 200+ pictures. As previously indicated, the user interface is amazing. There are 2 control rings available at all times. One is small - placed under the right thumb. The other is around the lense. Both have excellent ergonomic feel - just the right amount of resistance then a positive soft lock in the position where you want it to stay. The screen is excellent. I don't know how many pixels it is, but it is vibrant, large and clear.. Everything is easy to set on the camera. Doing non - studio portraits and events, I am used to checking ISO, WB, f-stop, and shutter before every set of shots. Each one of these is at my fingertips on the S90.. The image quality is amazing. Even at high ISOs the pictures are amazing. I have never had a point-and-shoot that had usable images above 400 ISO. This camera can produce usable 4x6 in prints at 1600 ISO. They are not perfect, but I was essentially shooting in the dark. This is also a function of the f2 lense.. I really can't say enough about the intelligent design of this camera.. My only reservations are regarding: the grip, as mentioned above; no optical viewfinder, which i like to use in very bright situations, and the choice of battery - this is the first point and shoot that I have had in a very long time that didn't take AA batteries. I like AA batteries because they serve the way I use a point and shoot camera. They are available in every city and country, they don't require any pre-planning for charging, and the lithium ones are light and let me shoot almost endlessly. I guess I will have to deal with toting around the charger - which is admittedly very small.. This is the camera that every photo-enthusiast should have in the pocket or briefcase (like mine) at all times. If you don't set all of your controls before you take a picture buy one of the basic A-series Canons-you will save money and be just as happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. All other points of this P's are outstanding.. 
Cons:. 2nd the pop-up flash being really annoying. I also am waiting for the day I break mine.. 
Summary:. Well worth the cost. If you pick this up you will not have to buy another cam for many years to come.. 

$$;
Pros:. The rings work great! The rear one is not a problem. It's easy to get optimal settings. Image quality great between 80-200, which is easy to stay within given a fast lens. This is an ideal carry anywhere camera and a perfect complement to a DSLR.. 
Cons:. Lacks some features that the G11 has, like the ability to use a remote control or use of an external flash. Images do get grainy after 400 (typical to point and shoot cameras).. 
Summary:. This camera has reproducible, excellent image quality in a compact form factor. I can't imagine a better camera at this size, nor one that has controls so readily at hand. It feels sturdy. The dials are extremely useful and make the camera easily configurable and FUN. With a little practice it is easy to get excellent photos. This is a great pocket-sized alternative to the G11 with most of the same features and picture quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well constructed, well orgamized screens. The control ring and shortcut button are great. Good quality in low lighting. Sharp pictures with negligible noise below 400 ISO. RAW photo capability in a small camera ... where can you get that.. 
Cons:. Don't like the position of the popup flash (I'm left handed). The camera needs a grip as the metal body can be quite slippery at times. Lots of noise and lack of sharpness at very high ISO settings, but less so than other small camera that I tested.. 
Summary:. This camera packs a punch for its size. RAW image capability is a big plus for the serious amateur or backup camera for the freelancer ... sharp pictures even in low light ..Great on the fly controls with the front ring (I assigned focal length) and the shortcut button (Iset for ISO). At about $500 this camera does not suit everyone's budget. Its far superior to the competition that falls in the $325 - $450 price range. Cut out a few dinners out and put the extra $100 to $150 into this camera that will give you years of pleasure. I give Canon high marks for this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality Jpegs, Fast lens, fantastic in low light. Light, Small and Powerful. Exactly fits my needs. PIcture colors are superb better than a panasonic for me.. 
Cons:. The ring in the back can be moved easily and can affect exposures. I like a viewfinder but it's ok.. 
Summary:. For me it's all about the picture quality, that is the colors from people to landscapes. And the S90 delivers. The jpegs are great straigh out from the box and that is great because who has the time to process every Raw shot. Let the camera do the processing as much as possible. I could have bought a Panasoic but the colors have always stopped me from buying one. I find the skin colors to be cold and a little pinkish. I prefer canon colors, they pop and are nicely saturated.. This camera is fun to use, you don't think twice about carrying it with you and you know you will get top-notch pictures. There is one picture that I took that is looks almost 3 dimentional in depth. That is how good this camera is.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast lens, excellent picture quality, solid build, large screen, fast start-up for P&#38;S camera. 
Cons:. Flash and rear dial placement detract from otherwise great camera.. 
Summary:. Excellent picture quality for P&#38;S camera with exceptional low light images without flash. Unfortunately, the flash and rear dial placement detract from this otherwise great camera. Flash placement is annoying but not should not cause serious problems. However, the placement of the rear dial which is easily rotated can be a disaster depending on the shooting mode. In those instances when the dial controls ISO, it can be accidentally moved to settings which wash-out your images. Most novice users should shoot in auto mode that provides excellent results in most instances.. 

$$;
Pros:. f/2 lens, very good low light picture quality for a PS, many manual features including AEB for exposure bracketing (big plus), flash compensation and ring dials in front and back, 10MP which is perfect with a good size sensor for low noise.. 
Cons:. Terrible flash placement, washed out LCD PureColor II screen when viewing dark images, hand strap does not have wrist lock, poor battery life, ring dial on back of camera is way too loose, no HD video, pricey, poor plastic build top/bottom of camera.. 
Summary:. I have used this camera for 3 weeks now and there are both pros and cons that I think you should read if you're considering buying this camera. I've found cons that no one has stated or listed as yet which I hope helps in your buying decision. I've examined this camera very closely and feel a rating of 3.5 stars is very fair if price was not an issue then a 4 rating is justified. But considering the price point with no HD and poor plastic construction on top/bottom of camera I feel this is fair. The front and back of the back are metal.. Pros:. Nice f/2 lens which lets in twice as much light as a 2.8 lens, this also helps in taking great low light pictures.. A great 10MP resolution balance with a big sensor to reduce noise and grain in the pictures. AEB function for exposure bracketing and HDR (this feature not listed on box or Canon's site even though it has AEB).. Flash compensation control to help with avoiding the wash out effect of a strong flash close to the subject.. Custom setting which allows to change the sharpness and saturation of the default picture settings.. As mention the ring dials in front and back of camera for easier manual control and setting.. Micro Focus for excellent bokeh control to close up subjects.. Cons:. The f/2 is only at the widest setting.. LCD screen Pure Color II is of poor quality when re-viewing or taking dark images due to washed out pixels...very disappointing as this problem exists on almost all of the S90's I've examined which was about 5-6 cameras. Never had this problem with previous SD Canon's but there is a definite problem with quality control on this issue.. The top/bottom of the camera is made from plastic, unfortunately when you place your finger on the top of the camera the plastic (squeaks and clicks) when pressure is applied for holding the camera.....really disappointing. Again this probelm exists on 5-6 cameras that I tried, another quality issue Canon needs to address.. The battery life is sub par you will definitely need 2-3 batteries to take you through the day.. Ring dial on the back of the camera is way too loose, as even your shirt sleeve can change the settings accidentally if you're not careful, as well too much spinning is required to changed the setting where you sometimes have to spin the dial around over 3-4 to reach your settings.. No HD video which is a shame with such a nice f/2 lens especially for the price point.. A very annoying issue is the pop up flash that is perfectly placed where you place your left finger on top of the camera you will need patience to learn to hold this camera correctly without blocking the flash.. Severe barrel distortion at widest setting when shooting RAW, you WILL need to use Canon's software to straighten, JPEGS are fine.. The strap that comes with the S90 does not have a wrist lock as it does with the SD line so that the camera doesn't slip off your wrist when dangling. The camera is a bit on the heavy side so you should get a strap with a wrist lock as the strap it comes in is long and loose and will definitely fall off your wrist and I have big hands and was surprised when it almost slipped off a few times so I bought a strap with the wrist lock and its worth it. The last thing you want is to drop this camera because it will not last one fall with the top and bottom made from flimsy plastic.. I would have liked to have seen a 24mm or 26mm wide angle lens at this price point since there is no HD but what can you do.. Hope this info helps because you will have the same issues as me with the pros and the cons. It is probably the best PS camera out there for now until the Panasonic LX4 comes out next year but who knows how much better that will be and how much it will cost and what availability will be like. If you can get the S90 for a better price and hope you get one that doesn't have washed out dark pixels then you would have a really good buy and should be satisfied with your purchase.. Cheers.. 

$$;
Pros:. The fast lens and the relatively high ISO ability of this camera make it one of the best I have ever seen in a P&#38;S camera that fits in your pocket.. 
Cons:. Pop up flash is a real pain. The camera has no grip on it meaning you wind up holding it with both hands - fingers on the top, thumbs on the bottom. Problem is your finger(s) on the left hand rest on top of the flash. Also, only 3.8 x zoom.. 
Summary:. If they put a grip on the camera and upped the zoom factor, this would be an amazing P&#38;S camera. Its ability to take pics in low light is probably the best there is today in a camera of this size and price. If Canon fixes these two issues, it would then be, in my opinion, a 5 star camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. The lens is sharp and good in low light. DSLR type ability to control shots. Shoots in raw. 
Cons:. Zoom is slow and jerky. Ring on back is too easily moved. Terrible postiioning of pop up flash. Slow focus response. Cannot adjust focus point.. 
Summary:. I think the design is "sloppy". It provides DSLR type control, a big sensor and a nice lens, but Canon must have thought that was enough. At this price point it should be more than an average performer, the zoom should be smoother and quicker as I find that I miss a number of shots because of the sluggish zoon, and it seems that I am among many users who find the flash placement and the ring on the back a constant irritation.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good low light shooting. Good control - manual, aperture, and shutter speed. Nice sized screen. Unique and usable front ring dial.. 
Cons:. Ring dial on back of camera is way too loose - results in inadvertent exposure compensation. Zoom range is too limited. Camera is almost too small, resulting in ergonomic issues Battery life is not adequate. Expensive.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera so I could have more control in a small package. Many camera manufacturers make their small camera automatic, but Cannon has attempted to give the shooter some "DSLR" control in a small camera. It has only partly succeeded. For example, good low light shooting with f2.0, but the f2.0 is only available at the lowest zoom level. I like the unique and usable front ring dial. I shoot mainly in aperture-mode, so the front ring is to change the aperture. Using the ring is fast and accurate. But the ring dial on the back of the camera is way too loose - results in inadvertent exposure change. After shooting a couple of hundred shoots, I was becoming conditioned to constantly check the exposure compensation. I found many time, that my fingers had accidentlly changed the exposure compensatoin. This is very bad. Another weakness on this camera is the low zoom. As always compromises have ot be made in a camera this small, but I constantly found myself zooming past the optical zoom into digital zoom. I carry this camera constantly, so I like its small size but the design is a bit off-putting. With sucha small form factor, my ahnds are constantly struggling to get comfortable, With such a lovely screen on the back, battery life really suffers. I was walking around for about fours hours and was already getting a battery warning. Albeit it during this time I was looking at the screen a lot, admiring both the pictures and learning all the controls.. So in summary: I would like a bigger zoom with an even faster lens in a small package, where the battery lasts longer. Keep the front ring and redesign the back ring to be tighter. Or redesign the camera to guide fingers away from inadvertently touching of the ring. Also, decrease the ridiculous price. I don't ask for much, do I? :). Finally, I am not sure if I am keeping the camera. Perhaps I will return and wait for the next gen, where hopefully Cannon will keep the good features and improve the not so good.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Combination of control ring and the small ring behind which help to control the setting easily. - F2.0 focal length. 
Cons:. - Battery not last long for whole day trip, be prepare an external battery. - Maximum aperture only F8. - I am like to put a question mark on the quality control of canon which suddenly not working and stop me on shooting beautiful scenery at Sydney.. 
Summary:. Performance wise is the best among the pocket camera and i am satisfy on the photo quality. I bought this camera 2 months ago, and it works well at the beginning of my travel at sydney, but bad things happen is it suddenly not working when i am take out my canon s90 to take some beautiful scenery shots. I hope canon can enhance the quality assurance in order camera won't going off when try to take a great scenery photo, this is really upset and disappointed when this case happen on the consumer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to learn. Beautiful, large LCD screen. Nice pictures.. 
Cons:. Flash is supposed to automatically rise when needed. It does not. Called Canon Support and they said "oh, sorry you'll have to return it or send it to Illinois to have it repaired." It's 6 hours old!!!!. 
Summary:. Seems to be a little on the fragile side, if after 6 hours of ownership, the flash is already broken.. 

$$;
Pros:. when it worked-it took a good pictures. 
Cons:. you have to pay extra $80-100 for extended waranty or for repare. But when it is heppened 2 months after I got the camera A470-even if I had this warranty, I would think twice to buy anothe Canon again. This was my only camera that broke so soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. The front dial makes it easy to change certain features depending on the mode.. 
Cons:. Lack of "super fine" JPEG compression ratio! A MAJOR flaw for all of Canon's new cameras. Images are always grainy/noisy, colors are bland, lines are soft, and contrast is very flat.. 
Summary:. The S90 has some major flaws despite Canon?s attempt to provide a great product. The single most disturbing flaw is the lack of ?super fine? compression ratio. Canon?s Japanese engineers have eliminated this on their entire new fleet line.. Regardless of any settings users change, images come out flat, blurry in same cases, noisy/grainy and the colors are faded at best.. Why has Canon eliminated the ?super fine? JPEG compression ratio!?!?!?! I?ve tested the SD980 IS and the S90 (and several others for that matter); none of their new cameras offer anything remotely as nice as my aging SD800 IS. The SD800 IS still produces the best pictures I?ve seen for a quick shot digital cam; images are always sharp and crisp, colors are vibrant, and with just a little manipulation I am ready to print.. Do your research before buying a Canon. Email them and request their engineers bring back the ?super fine? JPEG compression ratio.. (I tried to rate this with only 1 Star, but CNet is sure to force users to give at least 1.5 stars.). Updated. on Apr 15, 2010.
