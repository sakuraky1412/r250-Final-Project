we stayed here for 5 nights and overall were very happy with our stay .
the location was the best part as you are 5 -10 min walk to the shore walk with stunning views of the opera house and downtown skyline , 15 min walk to milson 's point ferry and luna park , 10-15 min walk to the milson 's point train station , 10-15 min walk to the stairs leading up to the harbour bridge ( by the train station ) , less than 10 minutes to get to restaurants and shops .
airport connections : take the t2 train to central station , then transfer to a train leading to north shore or any other that will take you past milson 's point .
will be around $ 18 aud each and will take approximately 35 minutes .
from the train station it 's a 10-15 minute walk to the hotel .
the rooms are all very nice , clean and well equipped .
just be aware that all rooms have a share toilets and showers .
upgrades taking place right now .
the breakfast was great ( 630-9 weekdays , 730-10 weekends ) but just make sure while you are booking your room that you confirm breakfast is included in your price .
the only negative to this spot right now is that during our stay and continuing on this week and beyond they are doing mass contraction to the hotel which means that there is a lot of noise between roughly 8am - 4pm during the week .
of course if . . .

of course if you are not around during that time it should n't be an issue but if you plan on relaxing and working at the hotel you find it a bit difficult right now .
overall though i would recommend this hotel and would come back in the future.
