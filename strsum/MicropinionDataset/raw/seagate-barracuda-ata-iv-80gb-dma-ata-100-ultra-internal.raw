$$;
Pros:. Five year warrenty tells it is rock solid and extrimly reliable, Fast seek time, very quite, Performance The Best in its class.. 
Cons:. not avalible at all the places.. 

$$;
Summary:. The Seagate may be 3% slower than competitor drives, but the noise output is inaudible. I have tried the Maxtor D740X, which is significantly (and annoyingly) louder. If you cherish your hearing, you'll love this drive.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have a 4 year-old comp. with a Maxtor 4.78GB HD. I upgraded to this Seagate, and the difference was phenomenal! To defrag used to take 45+ mins. I copied the entire contents of my old drive over to the Seagate, and the Seagate defrags in under 10 mins. It's ultra-quiet. Certainly a great choice if you want to breathe new life into that old computer. Makes my wimpy 400 celeron perform like a champ. Progs open faster, run smoother. No more crashes and freeze-ups. Wish I had bought this long ago!. 

$$;
Summary:. To all People. THis drive is one of the most unbeleviable drives around. Its Fast, Silent And most of all reliable. If you are looking for a 80 GB HD than this one is the way to go !!!!!!!!! Segate is the best!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. Have been running my Dell 24/7 since Febuary 2002, and even after filling my 80gig Seagate to the max more than once, it has yet to ever make me think that it could ever have a problem. I have to look at the HD light to see if it is working, and I did put a dual fan cooler on it just as a precaution, not to mention that I plan to have it last for many years. It has yet to give me any problems of any kind.. 

$$;
Summary:. Ultra-Quiet, quality, and performance are all here. Replaced two 40gb Maxtor drives and my ears love it! I cannot see any sacrifice in performance either.. 

$$;
Summary:. seems fast to me too. but mainly its soooo quiet and sooo reliable.. 

$$;
Summary:. I got this based purely on all the buzz from friends. it speeded up my system considerably. more than fast enough, better believe it. I knew it'd be quiet. and everyone says seagate's the most reliable.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have returned several IBM drives. After about six months they develop a whine and become unusable in the desktop environment. While most consider the ease of returning an IBM drive good support, I think they have simplified a recurring problem. I always buy Seagate for my production server systems and they work great and are quiet. This drive is no different. Seagate is beginning to make their pricing more competitive as indicated by this latest offering and the realiability is unmatched. IBM drives have failed me and I think they are overrated. The only complaint, I wish they had an ULTRA133 edition.. 

$$;
Summary:. i usally listen to the drive to tell when it has finished. with this 80gig seagate all i can hear is the fan and it outperforms all the other drives i have the misfortune to western digital maxtor ibm ect ect ect ect. 

$$;
Summary:. I purchased my barracuda on sale at Frys (outpost.com's real stores) months before I had the money to build my new computer. I got it for $89 after the mail in rebate for $50! Great deal on 80 gigs. It runs extremely quiet. I can't even hear it above that cpu cooling fan in my machine, which actually at times causes me to wounder if my machine is frozen or whether it is doing some intensive hard drive activity. It has worked great for all my applications. If I ever fill this one up I would deffinitely have to consider another, espeically at the price I paid.. 

$$;
Summary:. I love my 80 gig seagate. So much so that I now have two. One in a firewire case and one in my box (in addition to a 60 gig seagate). I bought my latest one to replace a Maxtor drive in my external case. I couldn't stand to be anywhere near the Maxtor drive. Get this and you'll love it.. 

$$;
Summary:. love seagate and love this hard disk! friendly instructions, totally easy installation software, friendly service, thanks seagate. 

$$;
Summary:. ahhhhh... no more freezframes, no waiting. power users and gamers, video freaks, if ya don't want a SCSI cheetah, this is the best ATA drive you can get.. 

$$;
Pros:. no errors, long life. 
Cons:. a tad slow, when burdened with 2007's security req's. 
Summary:. In addition to excellent service from this drive, I've owned several Seagate drives and have had excellent performance and reliability from all of them.. 

$$;
Pros:. average price and name brand. 
Cons:. no SATA, faster speeds available. 
Summary:. Most reliable HD i have owned. Previously owned a Maxtor which lasted a good few years with few problems. Had 2 different Western Digitals, one of which crapped out on me. I have owned this one for about 3 yrs and no problems yet, I am Very satisfied.. 

$$;
Summary:. I went thru a lot of reviews, most people say that it's slow but i don't think so. It works very good and pretty fast. I owned 3 of Barracuda 80GB and i love it. Thanks to Seagate, i would buy another Seagate in future purchase. (Plus very reliable).. 

$$;
Summary:. All the reviews I have read say that this drive is slow and yet in my real wprld situation it outperformed my IBM Deskstar (1 week old). It is quiet and doesn't run hot in my system. No setup issues and the included software worked great with my XP system. I am about to buy another one for my daughters PC.. 

$$;
Summary:. i just bought an 80gb barracuda iv to replace my wd 1200jb (120gb 8mb cache) 'special edition' harddrive which failed on me. not only is the barracuda better quality, but of course it is the quietest drive as well. i have tried drives from all the big manuf. but seagate has the best record for me... even their 40mb rll drives i had from my 386 days were still working good after 15 years of use!. 

$$;
Summary:. Itï¿½s really quiet and fast. I had other harddisks like Quantum and Western Digital and the Seagate harddisk is always the most quiest. My only disapointment about this Seagate hardisk model is it runs hot. If I put it running out of my comp case It remains hot! Maybe it needs a good case ventilation and/or a harddisk cooling fan.. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought this for the 80gigabytes, and like any 80gb drive that's what it has (despite the reader above's belief. Windows will read it as 76gb or something but Windows is miscalculating -- ask microsoft!) I added this to my system with a Maxtor D740X I bought first, also latest 7200. Seagates is notably faster, but it is hard to believe how quiet it is, the hype is correct. I can not hear it at all.. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought an IBM 60gb 60gxp around a year ago... it seems to last me about a month before it dies, and by dies i mean big time. If its formatted in NTFS i loose everything, in fat32 i can usually scrounge my documents: then i'm up for a low level format (or rezero as they call it) no wonder they sold their hard drive department to hitashi!!! i had to RMA it once and it took 3 months, never did they admit it was their fault or anything, just replaced my drive with a newer one with the same problems. I bought a seagate 40gb 2 months ago for AU$142 on special, and its a dream... not AS fast but its fast enough, quiet as a dream and RELYABLE.... 

$$;
Summary:. Easy to setup, great quality, great build, very, very quiet, fast etc. I can only assume that the bad comments come from people who dont have experience of other products.. 

$$;
Summary:. I OWED 5 IBM 45G'S AN 2 IBM 60'S AN 3 IBM 75G'S...LET ME TELL U SOMETHING ABOUT IBM...YEH THERE HARDRIVES ARE FAST ON PAPER BUT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BAD SECTORS AN THEREFORE U CRASH A LOT AN THERE UNSTABLE...WHO WANTS A FAST HARDRIVE IF U CONTIOUSLY BREAKING DOWN...AN HAVING TO REFORMAT YA COMPUTER EVERY MONTH....AN THE SPEED DIFF FROM IBM'S FASTEST AN WESTERN DIGITAL'S FASTEST WD1200JB AN THE SEAGATE 80GB (U WILL NOT SEE IN REALWORLD PERFORMANCE..ONLY ON PAPER)I OWN A SEAGATE 80GB AN ITS VERY STABLE...AN QUIET...NO MORE BAD SECTORS AN REFORMATING FOR ME EVERY MONTH.......ATA SERIAL WILL BE OUT SOON...WAITING FOR THAT SO I CAN SETUP A RAID WITH 2 SERIAL ATA HARDRIVES. 

$$;
Summary:. Seagate knows hard drives! For anyone who wants a great drive, with almost imperceptible drive noise - this is it. There are some that are faster, but louder and who knows how long they will last. Seagate makes top quality drives, and unless your really a hard-core user/gamer - it's plenty fast. If you want the fastest, yeah the WD special edition would be great. But for that extra money you get lesser quality (my opinion), more drive noise, and only a marginal gain in performance. It's a great all around drive. wait for the 60G platters and 8mb buffer!. 

$$;
Summary:. I've had mine for 4 months now - no problems. Bought it for ~$100 and I have no complaints. It's quiet, cool (stays at around 100 F - ambient is ~85 F), and reliable. I've used seagate (SCSI) drives for years and their support is great.. 

$$;
Summary:. I just bought my second Barracuda 60Gb as I needed some more space, now I can watch it fly when copying a 1Gb movie form one to the other. A note to David Jaynes; All drives manufactures (Seagate,Maxtor,Wd,IBM) state the capacity of their drives at 1Kb=1000Bytes, 1Mb=1000Kb &#38; 1Gb=1000Mb, Windows calculates uses 1Kb=1024Bytes, 1Mb=1024Kb and 1Gb=1024Mb hence windows will report a lower capacity than reported on the drive label. According to "speedskatr" Windows is miscalculating, this is not correct! Windows is right (maybe for the first time. in computers 1Kb=1024Kb..

Summary:. Network Interfaces:[ #1 (Realtek RTL8139 Family PCI Fast Ethernet NIC #2 - Packet Scheduler Miniport (10Mb/s) 0.00MB In, 0.00MB Out) #2(3Com 3C900B-TPO Ethernet Adapter (Generic) - Packet Scheduler Miniport (10Mb/s) 851.46MB In, 26.82MB Out) ] Total: [ 713.09GB In since 08/29/2002, 329.42GB Out since 08/29/2002 ]. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought this HDD after unfortunately dropping down my Maxtor D740 40GB. But this is not promising as much as Maxtor coz it is slower than typical maxtor HDDs &#38; not featuring ATA133 is a big hole for the performance wise, It's true that this magnetic chnk is quite low in noice. But ultimatley, what counts the performance of a drive? Not the sound.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fairly efficient, speed is OK, but slow with huge files. Nice, quiet drive. Seagate has been a reputable brand in years past.. 
Cons:. Hard drive seems to corrupt when you least expect it. My Seagate was four months into its service (as a secondary drive) when it suddenly and inplexicably went haywire. Lost over 13 gigs of multimedia files that were laid to waste after a reboot and Di. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought this excited over everything i've read about how silent it was, how smoothly it operated. Within 2 days of installing it, the thing went haywire...it started sounding as two metal plates were grinding each other to bits...moments after i shutdown and restarted, it wouldnt boot...after trying like 10 times to reboot, it worked...i copied a few important files, and then it died...i tried to format it before i sent it back to outpost.com but it was so inoperable i couldnt even format it, so i just got rid of the partition. if that was representative of all Seagate products, the company should be out of business fairly soon. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge compared to my HD. 
Cons:. Impossible to Set up. 
Summary:. I Have a Compaq Deskpro 650 mHz with a 10GB Hard drive and WinXP. I Received it but...MY COMPUTER WILL NOT RECOGNIZE IT! The Driver doesn't work, when i boot it will say NEW DRIVE DETECTED but in My Computer only my 10GB. Can anyone Help?. 

$$;
Pros:. Good while working. 
Cons:. Everythin sux when it no longer works..
