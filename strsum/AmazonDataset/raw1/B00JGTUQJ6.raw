Filter functions and tastes exactly like the more expensive brand
Worked great at half the price
Just as good as the more expensive filters I used to buy. Taste and function is the same at a much lower price
Have seen some bad reviews but don't know why. They always work great for me. Maybe some people aren't installing them correctly
First time I used this brand. But will buy it again. Worked just like all the others I have bought in the past
Works great
Great product at a better price
Tastes like the original filter I bought. But costs a lot less.
Worked fine -easy to install
Filter works like it is supposed to.
