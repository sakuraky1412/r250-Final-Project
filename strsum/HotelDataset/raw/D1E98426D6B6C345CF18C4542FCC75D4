one of the worst hotels i 've stayed at in a long time .
bottom line , if you can find an alternative that fits your budget , go with it - odds are that it will be better than p-hotel bergen .
this place has so many holes , it 's worse than swiss cheese .
i did n't have the issues with the desk staff mentioned in previous reviews , but the comments around excessive noise are dead-on .
it is probably the loudest hotel i 've stayed at ever - music , carousing , and revelers out until the wee hours of the night creating a ridiculous amount of noise .
plus , if you get stuck in the `` annex '' /yellow building , there is a pub and a horse racing office in the ground floor full of depressed , seedy , middle-aged men milling about .
not a good scene .
the rooms themselves are cramped , internet is very spotty , and the breakfast in a word , stinks .
the other building has a loud cafe right outside , so i am not sure it would be much better .
all in all , if you are a light sleeper definitely avoid this place , and if sleep is really important in general , avoid at all costs .
to be fair , the only redeeming qualities are that it 's location in bergen ( about a 10-15 min walk from bryggen/wharf area ) and comparatively lower-price ( though way overpriced by standards of us or most of western europe - paid low three figures per night for a triple-bed room ) . . . .

outside of these two factors , it 's really pretty bad .
if i return to bergen , would definitely find a different place to stay.
