unable to get a second night at hotel i had been in and booked in here as it was first i came across .
i felt price was a bit steep as more than i had paid the previous night for hotel with pool and spa but was too tired to look elsewhere .
inside seemed fine but once inside room i was a bit dissapointed , anaglypta painted wallpaper and a tiny tiny tv high up on the wall .
never mind , i thought only for one night .
after just an hour i found myself wheezing ( have asthma and sensitive breathing ) room did n't smell damp but do n't think it had been aired well enough .
had to open window for fresh air and seven though it was blowing a gale outside i had to sleep like this to help me breath .
woke up through night freezing as heating must have been on timer and non way i could turn it on ( did n't heat up till 7am ) made myself a coffee but milk was old and lumps visible so unable to have a drink .
have to say in morning went down early to get out of room quick as i could and breathing improved immediately away from the bedroom .
breakfast was lovely with home made scones which was a lovely touch .
owner friendly too so this changed my view a good bit as not all bad but for me personally in future i will stick to . . .

for the price i paid compared to price paid for really clean , comfortable and cosy room i had the previous night at kings manor , best western this was really poor value .
