compared to the other 5 on the market this is the 2nd cheapest in terms of monies but it pack's one heck of a punch  .
great sound and picture  .
great valentines day gift for your movie buff  .
this is one of the best things i have bought in i do not know how long  .
i wanted to archive my dvd collection on hard drive so i began with that  .
then i started looking for ways to play them on my tv and i ran into this device  .
i is surprised at how good this unit is for the low price that it is sold for  .
i have two wd my book 1 tb hard drives connected to it and i have my collection converted to  .
mkv files  .
they play great  .
there are other functions i would like , but for the price this unit is more than you could really ask for  .
you got me at file support  .
hdmi and optical  .
sweet  .
for the price of $110 this is a great product .
cant go wrong with this  .
i is getting tired of burning cds and dvds to play avi files in my divx    enabled dvd player  .
this is the perfect solution for me    stick the files on my 4gb thumb drive , plug it in and watch away the small size is perfect for my set up too    fits in the little space i have in my rack i only wish it had a front usb port    i have to trail a usb extension cable out the back of the device to attach my thumb drive too an sd slot would have been nice too , but not a big deal , since sd    usb converters can be had for $1 .
this is simply a fantastic device which i have been waiting for some time  .
i own several external drives and it works with each , whether simple flash or an encased aged seagate  .
currently i combined the wdtv with a wdpassport 500gig , it works without hiccups , fast and specially without additional plugs to the wall i have a very large library of ditigal media that with the wdtv , 1) saves me money    no need to buy and rip dvds , cds etc and 2) saves a vast amount of space  .
also , i have an older hdtv without hdmi , all i needed to do is hook it up with a hdmi to dvi cable and rca plugs for the sound  .
to me its similar to an ipod video without all of the proprietary software  .
you will need to update the driver to play all types of files but this too is simple  .
enjoy  .
i use this with a 500gb wd passport that i have ripped about 50 dvds on so far  .
hook up the hdmi and your in business  .
this device does exactly what i hoped it would  .
it makes music and movie playback via your home entertainment system , a breeze  .
it is simple to setup and can be used for sd tvs as well as hd tvs  .
most media extenders do not support the older tvs  .
the remote is simple and small and has a lot of power as it relates to it's range and angle .
if you download movies especially h  .
264 or mkv formats this little box plays them with no conversion and avoids the need to burn them to a dvd or blu    ray disk  .
you load the file on an external hard drive plug the external hard drive into the wd tv which hooks to your tv or home theater through an hdmi cable , or composite cables if you must , and you are good to go  .
the setup is as simple as it comes while it does show photos and play music to be honest i did not buy it for that purpose and have not tried those features i have the wd tv hooked to my home theater system which has a projector with 1080i output and a 100 inch screen  .
the quality of the video and audio output is excellent , essentially the highest quality you can get on 1080i , virtually blu    ray quality  .
the wd tv is also easily upgradeable with downloads from western digitals website the wd tv is relatively cheap for what it does  .
bottom line this is a great little box .
have had mine for over a year now and think it's a great addition to my entertainment center  .
two friends of mine went and bought one as soon as they saw how convenient this media player is .
out of the box , this media player is a little clunky and flawed , but if you update to the latest firmware from wd , 98% of the issues are fixed  .
if you are like me and have to have support for something the factory firmware doesn't support , you can void the warranty and install a custom firmware , and allowed me to use my ext2/ext3 formatted external hard drives  .
it's quite simple and very safe  .
there has been very few video formats that i have not been able to play , and my favorite being mkv , is supported (for anime , i know , i'm a loser)  .
you truly cannot go wrong with this , unless you have to go with a proprietary standard , such as wmv , which this little guy will always say no to , and could be a problem that some people here are having problems with but aren't reading the manual  .
as far as audio , i don't do much listening through my wdtv , since i like to listen to it on the go , but it does play many formats flawlessly , just in case you like to do so  .
i have not tried viewing any pictures , but that is also why i have a digital picture frame  .
you cannot go wrong with this little beast  .
slap a couple terabytes of hard drive space loaded with avi rips and mkvs that you have found , and you'll be happy , just remember to make sure that you update the firmware as soon as you open the box or you may have some issues that are mentioned in other reviews (aside from those not being able to play unsupported codecs) as for the firmware , i went with b    rad's wdlxtv firmware , which adds tons of cool stuff  .
note though , you can also damage your player if you are careless or mess with anything you have no experience in , such as advanced settings and other cool high    level linux stuff  .
as usual , modding can void your warranty , and with any mods you do , no warranty is implied , enforced , or provided  .
use at your own risk , should you go down that path .
i have been waiting for a video player with the long list of features to hit the market for my bedroom tv set for a very long time (i use an htpc for my main tv)  .
wd fits the bill quite nicely  .
it plays almost anything you throw at it , has hdmi and 1080p support and plays  .
isos (dvd disc images)  .
i even take it in my minivan to use on the long trips  .
it had some problems at first , but wd is constantly working on improving the box and fixing all the known bugs  .
did i mention the price  .
there are other alternatives on the market from a less known companies , but they're a lot more expansive  .
wd is one of my favorite hard drive companies and now they have another outstanding product on their hands .
it is a useful hd media player especially when there are very limited players available in the market to play hd clips (i think iomega screenplay pro hd is the other available one)  .
i have a hd tv and hd camera  .
always the camera need to be connected and the files are to be copied to camera sd to playback and it is a hassle even though i could not confirm about its capability to play  .
mts files before buying (neither the product box nor the wd web page does not list this format) , it did with some initial hitch  .
i had to rename the  .
mts files to  .
m2ts files (  .
later i upgraded the firmware and it worked without problem then i had to struggle with remote to play each hd clip separately ( 1 or 2 min duration each)  .
i got a solution  .
the  .
mts files can be combined using a free software tsmuxer (try http  //www  .
softpedia  .
com/progdownload/tsmuxer    download    92743  .
html)  .
and now i have an excellent device to playback the hd clips  .
in addition you can use your hd tv to play back high res  .
photos  .
hence , it makes the hd camera , digital still camera and your mp3 collections more useful and meaningful (enjoy  .
) at relatively low cost (around us$120/    in middle east) when compared to the hd gadgets (i mentioned earlier) we possess .
it is a nice product for unbeatable price and i use it a lot  .
i would be more than happy to see the cons sorted out (most can be done through firmware) , and i would be ready to spend more to get that functionality  .
combined with quiet external 2  .
5 drive it is welcome addition when on vacation or business trip .
overall , i really like this unit  .
i love having a way to watch my avi files on my 42 tv  .
however , i'd be lying if i said it didn't come with some frustrations  .
the remote is so frustrating because it is very slow  .
each press on the keypad can take 15 or more seconds before you can make the next entry  .
when your only search capability is to enter letters on a virtual keyboard , this is maddening  .
more functionality and zip on the remote is a must  .
the unit is almost non    functioning right out of the box  .
i thought i'd be returning it to the store  .
but once i made the firmware updates , things really turned around  .
now , it's just the remote functions that are the big drawback also , the user manual comes on an included cd  .
when i loaded this in my laptop , i got a warning message from my anti    spyware software (lavasoft ad    aware) that i should not continue    that the content posed a significant security risk  .
so i aborted that  .
therefore , no manual  .
good thing my needs and desires from the unit are simple   play my avi files  .
that , i can figure out on my own the price is fair but it does vary from seller to seller  .
i've seen it advertised from $99 to $129 cdn  .
shop around  .
but only buy from a place with a good return policy as i wouldn't trust every unit to perform perfectly  .
i'd want the option of exchanging it or returning it , if i were you all told , i give this unit a 4 out of 5  .
i like everything about it , except the remote  .
wd has to address these issues and hopefully this will be done on the next round of firmware updates  .
although when i gave them new buyer feedback about the slowness of the remote , they claimed this is not typical (other users' opinions agree with me) and i should make sure the wd is not too close to the tv because some tvs will leak infrared radiation that can interfere with the wdtv from receiving commands from the remote  .
however , they do not say what is too close  .
mine is 2 feet from the tv  .
i'm sure most people would place theirs the same distance away bottom line   buy this unit  .
you'll love it .
it's true this is a very good player for the money though it does have buggy issues as many have reported  .
too bad western digital has not released a firmware version yet to fix these problems  .
once they do this will be a hard to beat player since it can do almost everything you would want it to do  .
seems there are two types now   with and w/o hard drive  .
those with hdd like the mediagate or popcorn hour are a good choice  .
those w/o hard drives like the wd tv , iomega screenplay are good too but you have to attach some sort of external usb storage anyway  .
so choose wisely  .
if you are looking for something that may be better than the wd tv , search for this   mediagate mg    m2tv  .
this is the newest player from mediagate which can do everything the wd tv can but actually supports more formats like rmvb (real video) for many asian videos  .
so this is one item i'm really looking forward to  .
hoping the reviews are good on this one .
love the product       this is what i've been waiting for  .
i'm sold .
despite it few limitations the wd tv hd media player is a ideal device for playing back recorded media without having to rely on a computer  .
it's compact design make easy to carry from place to place and it easy set up makes it great for parties or family gatherings  .
it can have two hard drives plugged in at one time and plays most formats flawlessly  .
i brought one after my computers crashed and its been a godsend by allowing to access to all my family movies , music and photos stored on my hard drives .
i bought this device out of a desire to watch some of my videos on my tv rather than my computer set    up is easy  .
plug it into your tv , plug    in a usb drive and it works i have had some problem with the remote not responding , this is easily fixed by unplugging the device and plugging it in some  .
mkv and  .
avi files have not worked , i merely use a third party converter for those all in all though , it does what i need it to do and western digital keeps updating it i'm pretty pleased with it .
great product , high on usability got minor drawbacks but its the best in its class , i got both iomega and wd and its far ahead .
it also plays all the latest video formats too including h  .
264 and x  .
264  .
happy that it has a dolby digital 5  .
1 and dts audio support  .
unfortunately , we could not enjoy it because it is not in sync with the picture most of the times  .
the menu is not as simple as it should be  .
i is told that it has a blu    ray quality , which i am yet to see .
great cost benefit , but do not expect new firmwares or support from the manufactur .
updated  .
on feb 28 , 2010  .
cheap hd player which plays most of the thinsg i throw at it now that egreat has come up with eg    m34a (see egreathd  .
com) , which is essentially a popcorn a    110 , at sub usd140 , this wd tv deal could loose it appeal .
let me tell just give you some pearls by saying one thing right at the get go    do not buy it  .
i got this media player about 6 months ago , while there were not many choices out there  .
it is simple to understand why wd wanted to get this one out of the gate so fast , well the product was not ready  .
a few things swing to mind that bothers me about this product 1) it got the job done but with glitches , it plays most of the movies but some got audio only and some got video only 2) you immediately got stressed when find out if you lost the remote , you will be out of luck since there is no on device control buttons 3) heat , lots of heat  .
given the size of the device , you will how they handle the cooling issue , well , the answer is there are none  .
no fan of any sort whatsoever , once the device is overheat , you will notice the performance will take a hit , or your house is on fire the bottom    line is , we are going to see a very furious competition regarding media set top box such as apple tv , google tv and boxess , wait a little and let the dust settled , then you will for sure get the most bang for your bucks .
if you want to avoid disappointments , you must dig deep into file    types , read the manual and browse the support    forum (http  //community  .
wdc  .
com/) before you buy  .
things are always not what the seem here .
the wd    tv can play a large number of video and audio formats , from any usb drive  .
it has 2 usb connectors , so it is convenient to have a hard disc permanently attached to it , and left the other free for playing from a pen drive  .
i have read that you can plug an usb hub , but i have not tested whether it works  .
what convinced me to buy the wd    tv is its capability to play flac files , i  .
lossless sound files , since then i could rip all my cd collection and listen to them in cd quality trough my hifi system  .
moreover it has a hdmi connection , and i could also see movies on my hd    ready tv  .
in fact it can play full    hd files , i would like to be able to use this feature in the future the quality of both image and sound is good (not audiophile , but excellent for the price)  .
the design is elegant and the size is very convenient  .
the menu is simple to use  .
the big problem is the organization of the files , since when you have a large number of them is rather cumbersome  .
you can select music files by album , by artist , or navigate on the folders of your hard disc  .
but to select an album you have to find it between all your albums in alphabetical order , regardless the artist  .
if you have a large number (easy in a 500 gb drive) this is a hard task  .
if you select by artist , you find all the songs by that artist in alphabetical order , so mixing all the albums  .
it will be more convenient to find albums by that artist , in order to select one to play  .
other problem , which should be easily solved in a firmware update , is that there is no option to play continuously (i  .
without gaps in sound) sound files from an album  .
this is awful when listening to certain albums or to live recordings of the video files i used for testing the unit , roughly one third played without problems , other third played without sound , and the other third did not play at all  .
when i updated the firmware , those without sound then played without problems  .
those not playing continued to not play  .
the unit came with a conversion software which i have not tested yet , i hope this will permit to convert these files into a compatible format , but i cannot confirm it in conclusion , if in a future firmware update wd solves these issues , the wdtv would be an excellent player of all types of media files  .
but for the moment it is not  .
before buying this unit , i would recommend checking the release notes of the last released firmware version (which you can find in the wd web page) in order to check whether all these issues have been actually solved  .
if yes , then the firmware update is very very easy (simply copy the file in a usb pendrive and plug it into the wd    tv) .
i originally set the wd tv up using a hdmi switch using 1  .
3 cables to my sony bravia kdl    40x2000  .
the interface hung 1 in every 3 boots (it would go to save screen mode after a while but the remote never responded until switching the device off on at the wall socket)  .
i then did some trouble shooting dedicated the device to each hdmi port swapping numereous hdmi cables updating the firmware but the problem only worsend to working about 1 in every 15 boots  .
this is all extremely frustrating to say the least  .
i went back to the store swapped wd tv 3 times continued the trouble shooting but had the same issue on all devices  .
i came to the conclusion that it could be one of three issues a hdmi issue with the wd tv , the tv is not recognising the wd tv properly , or i just got a bad batch  .
every other device i have connected to the tv works without fault including my pioneers dv    410s with has divx operational thru a usb port to external hd i is extremely disapointed as i like the product but feel it has been released to early requires a load more tests updates  .
i have read forums from other people with similar but not identical hdmi issues to mine  .
i beleive there may be a known error with the hdmi  .
i also read about a possible hdcp certified issue that may be causing these problems on some tv's the composite worked well even on my mother in laws 18 year old telly using a scart to composite converson box i ended up purchasing a mediagate mg    450hd i have been testing it since yesterday it runs very well but does not accepts slightly less media formats .
they're no longer responding to these complaints on their forum  .
i speculate that it is not correctable from firmware and is a limitation of processing power of their video decoder  .
this is because there have not been any more firmware updates for just under a year  .
this tells me from a business perspective they maybe coming up with a better design in the future and would never admit to under powered video processor .
when i found out that the unit is taking between 7 and 14 seconds to display my slideshow photos instead of the 3 seconds that it is supposed to , i went through a lot of time    consuming trouble to send it back to wd  .
you must fill out forms on    line and get an rma number , box it carefully , print the rma form on 3 sides , ship it to the depot at your expense , and wait  .
that's after communicating by email with their tech    support for a few days  .
eventually i got a replacement which operated no better than the original  .
when i called about a refund they said to call the store where i bought it on    line  .
they didn't return the original box i shipped it to them in , so tiger direct will likely not accept it  .
i have several wd external drives , and i like them , but this unit just won't do what they say it should and my photos are not huge files  .
they are bigger than most , but even wd says they should present no problem .
i bought this device after hearing good things but my own experience is awful  .
i connected it to my 1  .
5tb seagate hard drive when it had about 800gb worth of video on it and it worked , albeit slow at first  .
when you first connect it up , it chugged doing something and took 1/2 hour before you could actually use it because it needs to cache what data you have on your drive  .
it also needed to use 5gb of my drive to write this info  .
anyways  .
afterwards , it worked fine but soon after copying more information to it (1  .
2tb in total) , i ran into serious problems  .
it no longer could see the drive  .
not sure why , i contacted wd support  .
the technician told me to run their hard drive test tool  .
i ran it and waited the 18 hours for it to run  .
it passed the test just fine  .
i told the technician but he told me to replace the drive because it is bad  .
i reiterated that it passed the test , not failed and that it is a seagate drive as well  .
he told me that they only suport wd drives  .
if you think being treated like this is good , then by all means buy this crappy product  .
i expect something to work when i get it dealing with wd has been an endless source of frustration  .
more than 2 months have passed , and i am still waiting for a replacement .
