I like this as a vent as well as something that will keep house warmer in winter.
Looks great.
I sanded it and then painted it the same color as the house.
I purchasaed a new dryer and did not want to reuse the cord from my old unit.
Price and delivery was excellent.
Quality was as expected.
Fit my new LG dryer perfectly.
This unit installed in a pretty straight forward manor.
good item.
Good value for electric dryers.
No Complaints.
So I decided for the price I ordered a spare just in case.
I got a service tech undid the back and changed it in seconds.
Great deal and fast shipping!.

There's no way to look at the old used filter to know it should be replaced, but there's no way one of these can be used for two seasons.

i can't really compare much else on the range since i haven't used it much and i am  not much of a cook!  the stainless steel does tend to rust and stain.

Getting these burner covers at stores used to be easy.
They are value priced and come from a good dealer.
I am glad I found Amazon for my future needs.
30 minutes or so on You tube looking up videos showing you how to install the element could save you 100 bucks or more.
As the prices go up on appliance parts, you have to look elsewhere to save money.
received ok.
good job.
Sooooo.

would recommend to any one needs a fan motor.
works great and very quiet, much quieter than original motor in hood fan and faster.
I bought this by matching up the pictures, not the model number, and guess what?  It doesn't fit.
The unit I got looks workable and probably would be fine for the right replacement, so I can't fault them for the quality (or anything else, really).
I waited over thirty days before trying it so I ran past the window of being able to return it.

My bad.
Make sure you are replacing with a model that is compatible with your fridge.
Sorry about that, I took too long to leave the feedback, you are an amazing businessman.
Thank you again.
Great product, on time.

it will last 6 mouths and u get to do it agian.
I use the water for my coffee, tea, home made soda [Sodastream], and drinking water.
It supplies great tasting water and removes many toxins, according to the literature that accompanies them.
It removes contaminants and lead according to the literature, and it does improve the taste.
These water filters are designed for my Samsung refrigerator, and operate leak free.

Fit perfectly in my fridge.
Very satisfied with the taste.

Easy to replace.
All in all my clothes are actually drying at the right time now and I don't have to run it a second time.
The replacement needs screws to secure to the element and in my bag there wasn't any, so I had to make a quick trip to the hardware store to buy them.
Common failure part in these dryers, but with the great price on these replacements I still have margin to make money and repair the right time the first time!.
This did the trick to make my dryer new again.
You have to splice 2 wires together, so be prepared with wire cutters and something to crimp it.
(all of `10 cents,but added an extra hour to my repair time).
It is a bit different than the original.
It came new in plastic bag.
Excellent! Exactly what I needed.

ok part.
Upon very close inspection to the element (after it cooled off), I notice one of the ceramic pieces that hold a coil was broken off and the coil was touching the casing.
When I went back in the laundry room about 30 minutes later, it was incredibly hot in there, so I felt the dryer and it was very hot to the touch.
I got a warehouse deal "LIKE NEW" and when I installed it, the coil got hot with the timer switch "on" but the dryer wasn't running.
This unit is going back, and I guess I know why it was in the "used" bin.
It worked! Well, I'm not taking any chances with this thing getting hot like it did the coil slips off the broken holder and grounds out again.
I found a youtube video where the guy says the heater element is grounded out and will stay on.
I shut it off, unplugged and proceeded to see what the problem was.
I flipped the coil back on the ceramic holder and plugged it back in.
I don't blame the manufacturer, it's just a broken unit that got re-sold.
So in other words, I turned on the dryer to time dry 30 mins, but didn't start the tumbler yet.
I changed the thermostat timer and still did the same.
That would have saved me from a lot of trouble and potential damage from the heater coil being stuck on.
Meanwhile, off to the laundrymat I go!.
The next unit I will test BEFORE I install it.
it did not last more then 3 days.
Money saver for a do-it your-selfer-excellent quality.
Perfect fit for Maytag dryer.
good.

Thanks.

Having used Supco relays for over 30 years when they first became available,  I have always found them to be reliable and they saved me from carrying 40 or 50 types of relays in my truck.
They exceed the original device and very easy to install.
Worked great!! I just wonder how long they last.

This muti pack makes sure I always have the part to finish the job.
I can be in and out with a check in hand.
All is fine no problem to report, will definitely recommend them to my friends.
very low price good money maker too.

You can even flip the old ones around sometimes to get a bit more use out of them, but these are cheap enough to put in if you're going to take the time to fix the washer anyway.
Consider the wisdom of spending a lot of money on replacement parts for a 10+ year old washer that you originally bought for $400.
Cheap fix for an old washer; take the agitator off, put these in, replace the agitator, and you're back in business.
I'm in and out with these replacement parts on the van.
If you're having problems with your motor/clutch/timer or other electrical part, you might want to think about getting another top loader like an Amana before they stop carrying them in stores in about a year or so.

piece of garbage switch set to high that it will not shut off, couldn't return because it was taken out of package how else do you know if it will work if you don't take it out and try it.

The all-plastic insert ones are better than the ones with the metal ones - I used one of the metal inserts ones and after a short while the insert just spun inside of the coupler, which made me have to replace it AND pry off the metal insert from the shaft, which was the most annoying part.
Very satisfied I love these prices and prompt  courteous service.
JUST RIGHT.
Great.
This works great, wonderful product it worked good.
