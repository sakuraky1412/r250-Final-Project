the swissotel is one of our favorite hotels in chicago and the corner rooms have the most fantastic views in the city .

 the rooms look like they were just remodled and upgraded, there was an hd tv and a nice ihome docking station to put my ipod so i could set the alarm to wake up with my music instead of the radio .

great rooms staff and location but extras overpriced .

 hotel was very clean and the rooms were comfy .

 the standard rooms are small, the lobby bar is very small   .

 my son loved the chicago river view from our 31st floor , rooms where neat and clean .

 the rooms were small and much more expensive .

 i've olny ever stayed in the 'standard' rooms in this property, all of which are spacious and airy, and function well for both business or leisure travellers .

 rooms all appear to either look out onto the river and the bustle of chicago or, on the other side, will face navy pier,   .

 but we really did spend very little time in our rooms .

 the rooms were cleaned spic and span every day .

 but i guess they have to make money somehow since they practically give their rooms away .

 we were 2 rooms away from the elevators but could hear them clearly .

 building is shaped like a triangle and only has about 17 rooms on a floor, so very quiet and no hall noise .

 the hotel is shaped like a triangle from the sky, and this strange shape combined with the location of the elevator shafts made many rooms quite noisy .

 the view from the rooms is of the river and city, lake michigan or of millennium park .

 the rooms were great, the staff was excellent .

 the location of the hotel is perfect for shopping and local bars restaurants on the golden mile, and views from most rooms very good .

very impressed with rooms and view !

 they have just recently upgraded the hotel rooms and they are wonderful .

 the rooms are bright and airy with wonderful beds and bedding .

 the ideal location   coupled with great service and beautiful rooms makes for a wonder stay .

 very pretty rooms with an european flair .

 no more bathrobes in corner rooms suites  coffee service in room is parred way down  the buffet offered in the cafe is not as bountiful, although the cafe staff is inpeccable and extremely gracious and will bring you what you wish  check in staff not at all eager to upgrade you, even though you may be a frequent visitor .

 locker rooms were clean and had a sauna .

 rooms are good quality and clean, what you would expect from a four star business hotel .

 the rooms are large, the view was wonderful overlooking navy pier .

 the rooms are very nice , the location is excellent, but the service is terrible !

 the rooms are spacious and pristine with pillow, top beds that made it almost impossible to get up in the morning because it was so comfortable .

 we stayed in two rooms on the 22 floor in august with our two teenage daughters .

the view from the rooms was fantastic,my daughters are allergic to feathers and all trace of them were removed from the room as soon as we advised housekeeping .

the rooms were spotlessly clean and serviced each day .

we   and, unfortunately, got to stay in three different rooms .

 the rooms are very nice, well, appointed, with comfortable beds .

 the recent renovation is great , ,  the guest rooms are really nice .

 the rooms were large and clean .

 the rooms are very clean, comfortable and spacious and up, to, date .

 rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .

 it does suffer, however, from a trend that i have been noticing that as rooms at business class hotels are upgraded ,  particularly with a patch panel for the big lcd, tv ,  drawer space becomes less and less .

 why is the cleaning staff telling us they are out of coffee for the rooms ?

the rooms were nice, clean and updated .

 had to move rooms and floors .

 our rooms   were still not ready by 8pm .

the other two rooms were not clean .

 they didn't charge us for the room, , , , but, also did not offer any type of compensation to the woman who arranged these rooms in february .

 i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the rooms .

 the room was two rooms from the elevators and i could still hear them but it wasn't too bad .

the hotel and rooms were very clean .

great location nice rooms loved the swissotel !

 the rooms were very clean, the service was polite and helpful, and it's near the heart of chicago !

 thanks to travelzoo i was able to find an amazing deal ,  lakeside rooms for $129 night as part of a spring promotion .

 the hotel looks like an office tower, the rooms look like converted boardrooms and the place has all of the charm of a fortune 500 executive suite .

 the rooms were clean and modern .

 i ended up with a double on the 7th floor ,  i would've preferred a king since i was alone, but it was one of the renovated rooms so i decided to keep it .

 the rooms are large and well, appointed  , the staff was very professional and friendly, and the view was striking !

great location but rooms need some work .

 all on the way from milwaukee i was telling her how everyone was so nice and the rooms are beautiful .

 he then told me that they have no more rooms available and i was just going to have to deal with it since i was only staying a night .

 i called from my cell phone and asked if they had any rooms available and they said yes its blah blah blah .

 when i got to the room, i thought the new rooms would have a plasma since the website implies the new rooms would have them, but i guess those come later   .

i did notice that the bottles of water that they have in the rooms sell for $6 which i think is rediculous .

 there were no king rooms available when we checked in and the woman at the front desk was not overly helpful until we produced a copy of our confirmation wtih the king bed request on it .

 very nice pool and spa on the 42nd floor, rooms and lobby were clean, easy walk to michigan ave through via the lower level walkway to the illinois state center, beds were comfortable .

 the actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude .

 the rooms are spacious and have nice views, i was not impressed with the mattress and every, little, tiny thing costs money .

 very well equiped, the rooms are spacious and very comfortable with every thing you need .

 from other rooms but not nearly bad enough for us not to stay there again .

 we even got upgraded to one of the corner rooms   which also looked west toward michigan ave and the wrigley building .

 as the building rises the noise will get worse as they get closer to guest rooms .

i’ve stayed with my family at the hotel previously in two connecting rooms which were nice but unremarkable .

 this time, no connecting rooms were available so we booked a one, bedroom, 1 .

 in our case, it was cheaper than two connecting rooms and a far better experience .

 rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .

 rooms in this hotel are noisy though .

i called in a few hours before check in time to see if any rooms were available for check, in, the operator connected me to the reservations desk .

 got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .

the rooms were sleek and cool ,  great views .

 i recieved a great deal on the rooms here and it was wonderful .

 it was a good hotel, the rooms were clean and there were little things like dressing gowns that were a nice touch but other everyday things let the hotel down .

 our rooms were nice and didn't look worn or old .

 the rooms were comparable but i have to admit i loved the fairmont service, especially the bellhops and front desk .

 the rooms are in pretty shabby condition, but they are clean .

 while the rooms are a bit dated, the location is great .

the bad side is that the rooms are dated and in need of some upgrades, but for $109 a night through travelocity it was great .

 since we were staying during busy memorial weekend all the good rooms filled up quickly .

 our family of 4 frequents chicago and oftentime forgoes the comfort of a more spacious suite just to experience the thrill of the view of the river and navy pier that swissotel's lakeview rooms provide .

 you can see downtown and or the navy pier from most of the rooms .

great location great rooms and bed but no help from desk personnel .

 there is simply no better way to experience the 4th of july in chicago, than in one of the corner rooms with a view of navy pier .

 rooms very spacious and clean .

large rooms and excellent service .

 the interior of the guest rooms is decidedly generic, lacking the style of some of chicago's newer hotels   .

 but the rooms are large and nicely equipped with all the essentials of a business hotel .

 it seems most of the rooms here have great views and mine was no exception .

 it could be an excellent property if the rooms were updated with new mattresses, televisions and desks .

 the fairmont and hyatt next door have a few rooms with a view but not many .

 suspecting the rooms were allocated under the control of large travel agencies, i immediately called a friend and had them book me using hotels .

 these rooms are right next to the elevators .

 contemporary in its decor, the rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are very nice .

 for 2 nights there were 4 of us and for the last night only 2, so i was looking for 2 rooms or a room with 2 beds .

 i originally booked 2 rooms because their online reservation site would only allow you to book a room for 1, 3 people and there was no guarantee that you would get a room with 2 double beds .

the service staff always left our rooms clean, and even arranged my girlfreinds jewelry for her, untangling her necklaces and earrings from each other, and leaving them evenly placed on the bureau !

the rooms were clean, and upscale for the low price we paid .

great hotel with great rooms .

 the rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown chicago standards .

 most importantly, the rooms were quiet .

 the rooms and common areas were bland and far from a top flight hotel .

 the hotel is really pretty, but the rooms need some upgrading to be considered anywhere near a 4 5 star hotel .

i would say the best part about this hotel was that it was very very quiet from inside the rooms .

 the decor of the rooms and the communal areas is really dated, looks like it hasn't been touched for years .

 the swissotel was a great place to stay, rooms were very clean, and quiet at night for a great nights rest, with extremely comfortable beds, and high quality bedding .

 we had a pretty bad view on the 27th floor relative to the other rooms which faced lake michigan   there's some construction right now southwards and we stared at a giant mud pit with big cranes the entire visit .

 so, in all, i would definitely stay hereagain, even though the service stinks, the restaurantis for rich patrons with money to blow and the peopleare snobs, the rooms make up for it .

 some of the other hotels in the same class in chicago might be a little more decorative or chic but their rooms are not as comfortable and don’t seem to have the same dependable amenities that the swissotel has .

 rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .

 the beds were extremely comfortable, rooms were extremely spacious and the bathrooms were as well .

 we didn't check out the normal rooms but my parents were in a &quot normal&quot  room and loved it, and said it was one of the nicest and most importantly cleanest they'd been in lately .

 from talking to other guests, i concluded that rooms ending with numbers xx1, xx2, xxx19 and xx20 should be avoided unless you enjoy listening to elevators going up and down !

one thing that struck me as backward is that they charge $10 per 24 hours of internet usage in certain guest rooms .

 i pointed out to the manager that my firm held a conference there just months before and had used the conference facilities as well as several hotel rooms .

 honestly, i would rate the service and location a three, the rooms a four, and the view a five !

 then we were told that rooms on the top 5 or 6 floors are all non, smoking .

 the hotel was very nice, rooms were big, the pool hot tub area was very nice, and the location was great and easy to get to .

 it is true that the rooms have a little 'wear', but not to the point of being a problem .

 rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .

 word to the wise, , avoid the rooms ending with 11 .

 rooms were clean, good sized and great views of navy pier .

 the rooms were very clean and spacious .

 while the rooms are quite nice, i was dismayed by the snotty service i received at the swissotel in chicago .

 so, while the rooms are very nice, i will never stay at a swissotel again, in any city .

 then again, the rooms are much larger and the view more than makes up for it .

 the room was huge as hotel rooms go .

 rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed .

 rooms were very comfortable and spacious with nice furniture, comfy bed, luxurious bathroom, great tv, etc .

 there's also an indoor pool, large excercize room, and spacious men's and women's locker rooms on the top floor with floor, to, ceiling windows all around you .

 the rooms are not all that big .

 in fact we have always gotten the rooms with a view of the fireworks !

 the rooms are spacious and i've never had any problems with noise,  they are much quieter than other hotels i've been at .

 i called the front desk before we even set our suitcases down and asked if we could switch rooms .

 at this point it was close to 2 pm and my first fear was that my family and i would be stranded in chicago with no available rooms at a reputable hotel .

 the views were amazing, the rooms were comfortable and the staff was always helpful whenever i had a question .

 the views are fabulous, the rooms clean and roomy .

 large clean rooms and comfortable bed .

 these rooms are very speceous and the beds are very comfortable .

 the rooms were nice and the view was pretty good .

 exceptional rooms and service !

 hotel's architecture is nice, location near all point of interets and rooms are large, clean, quiet .

 we showed them our wyndham by, request card and were told for doing this one of our rooms would be given a complimentary upgrade to a conceirge level room ,  not both rooms but one room .

 strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .

the rooms with the navy pier view are beautiful and the restaurant on the lower level, currents, was an excellent dining experience .

 alot of the common areas that i enjoyed so much   have been turned into areas such as large banquet rooms .

 the rooms were clean and big and the view of the navy pier was incredible .

 expensive parking but great rooms .

 rooms were nicely furnished .

 pool is nice with whirlpool and saunas in the locker rooms .

 the rooms are business, oriented, so they are not as hip or stylish as, say, the sutton place or the w .
