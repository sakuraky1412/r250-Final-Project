yolanda , the front office manager , who seemed to be helpful to everyone and visible to all guests arranged for coloring books for the children , extra bottled water ( which is not included as standard at this marriott ) , and generally made the stay a pleasure .
bernardo , the concierge , was friendly and helpful and if you ask him , he will tell you how to see the entire old city for 1 euro on a bus that will bring you back to the front of the hotel ( # 116 ) .
the two room junior suite at the marriott was the perfect answer , but the wonderful surprise was that they upgraded ( it is part of their program when available ) one of the suites ( for the grandparents ) to the presidential suite .
it is served in a splendid roof terrace setting overlooking the city including the borghese gardens and the via veneto ( the most elegant street in rome ) .
sometimes being a marriott rewards member really pays off , and on this trip to the marriott grand hotel flora on via veneto it really did .
i had requested three junior suites since i was traveling with two families who each had two small children , and finding a room for four people in rome was almost impossible .
there was a game table for the children , a wonderful desk for the computers , and assorted antique furniture which created a gracious ambiance .
the service was excellent and sandro and donatello did a superb job in meeting individual needs .
the view was also wonderful , the ancient walls of the city and the borghese gardens iin addition to the via veneto. .
there is a carrefour supermarket across the street underground which is helpful for those odd sundries and snacks one sometimes needs .
