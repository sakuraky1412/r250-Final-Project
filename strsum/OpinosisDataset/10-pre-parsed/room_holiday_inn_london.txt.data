rooms were well insulated from outside noise .

if i had paid more than $100 for my room, i would have been disappointed .

both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit .

rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished .

tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay .

even standard staterooms aboard cruise ships were the same size or larger !

rooms are fairly small, but you have to expect this outside of north america .

my bathroom was, like the room, small .

bathroom was smaller than u .

our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc .
