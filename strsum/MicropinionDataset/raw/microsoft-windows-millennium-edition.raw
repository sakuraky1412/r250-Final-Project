$$;
Pros:. Better then WinXP!! It is very stable, I dont remember the last time it crashed. My XP computer crashes constantly! ME is definitly a buyer.. 
Cons:. none. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows is far better than Win95, 98 or SE in my opinion. Have had all OS on many different computers over the last few years and only ME has remained stable under most conditions with the same software running on them. Have not tried NT, W2000 or XP, so I can't say about them.. 

$$;
Summary:. Bought ME a month after it came out. Was having serious problems with 98 SE, you name the problems and I was having them. Did the upgrade and was sold on it immediately. 98 SE had to many files missing and to many issues. Went back to 95B before ME came out.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows ME is the best Microsoft Windows OS to come out since Microsoft Windows 95.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows ME is the best Microsoft Windows OS I have ever played with. If you wabt performance or you need a business OS, I would go with Windows 2000, but if you want fun, fast, easy to use, and MS-DOS based OS..... GO WITH WINDOWS ME!!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. ...but, the difference may be, believe it or not,is that I use an Athlon processor, not a Pentium. Whether it was a 700 Mhz Slot A, or a 1.0 Ghz Thunderbird, and now a 1.53 Ghz Athlon XP, Windows ME has always had a sweet relationship with the Athlon. To the guy out there who said in a review that the Athlon was a Pentium wannabe, I got news for you, the Windows ME operating system doesn't agree with you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stable if you take care.. 
Cons:. Does not like you to install too much software at once.. 
Summary:. You must keep the 'msconfig' startup folder under control.I only have system restore statemgr.exe and the auto update program for the antivirus and firewall running. This stops all those crash and freeze causing conflicts that get going, when programs all try to do their thing at the same time. Also it is vital that you do the regular maintenance work on the machine like running 'Scandisk,defragmentor' and the like.If you have a firewall like Zonealarm running it pays to make sure that all programs are denied server rights as this eats memory resources and invites more adware and spyware all of which use memory. Since I got a grip on these things ME seems to be as stable as any other OS I have used. By the way I recomend Internet Explorer 6 as it seems also to help stability.. 

$$;
Summary:. System locks up, starts running slow have to reboot every couple of hours. I hate it if it hadn't come with this hp system I wouldn't have it. Question what can I upgrade this system to. I use this pc for our business.. 

$$;
Summary:. i think it's good if you like pretty looks it loads up fast and ,but i wouldn't try upgrading your explorer to a 6.0. 

$$;
Pros:. Give this operating system a chance. If you want a os that has a low ram intake, then go with Me. Tips: Scan for errors, defrag, get 256 megs of ram and your computer will purr. 

$$;
Summary:. My compaq presario came with Windows ME in it, and it was my first OS. Than October 25, 2001 I upgraded to XP. I ran XP for one year and HATED it. So I just went back to Windows ME and am loving it. I don't have any crashes or errors, now maybe I was lucky and got a good copy, but I prefer it more than XP!. 

$$;
Summary:. winMe needs to add more models to its download list..is ralatively fast on the web,freezes or needs to be reconnected to isp often,overall a good edition....tech support isn�t all that correct at times,but good in some cases... 

$$;
Summary:. Many people who post negative reviews here are those who upgrade from Windows 95 or Windows 98. I installed Windows ME on a clean hard disk, and everything worked perfectly. I did not experince any problems when using WinME, except for the occasional BSOD (Blue screen of death). Overall, WinME is somewhat better than Win98 when installed cleanly.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows ME I never had any problems with, I have been told networking doesn't play well on this OS. It does boot up faster than Windows XP and shuts down faster as well. It's also based on the Windows 9x kernel, Windows 95,98,98SE, making it well compatible with almost anything.. 

$$;
Summary:. Positive Note: ============== Although this is a polished-up version of Windows 98, I say its pretty good. Sure, it sometimes takes me 17 minutes to get the thing going, but other than that, the OS is pretty good. I mean, don't laugh or anything, but I only have 62MB of RAM! If you all were talking about Me running with 128 Megs, well, i'm talking about good performance on 62 Megs! But do this-Get the following utilities Cacheman and AD-Aware. I use them, my computer runs just fine with those two programs. and WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! WINDOWS 98SE BEING BETTER THAN ME! IT MAKES NO SENSE! ahem, anyway,regardless of everyone's opinions, i say, Windows Me is just great!. 

$$;
Summary:. I really must be fortunate as I've had no problems with either Win95/98/98SE orME. On the other hand had to give up some hardware with XP (driver issues). XP will wait for me. As with any new application, given the vast multitude of hardware, software and users out here it is unrealistic to think any entity can produce an OS perfect in the first instance. Name one piece of software or hardware you've aquired that hasn't had an upgrade in the time you've had it. Run Intel and AMD but keep my systems clean and maintained uncluttered by unused apps/progs. Once a year I backup and reinstall just to keep evrything clean as possible.First rule of computers is backup but some never learn to do so. Never have had an issue with Microsoft as I always get prompt efficient replies to enquiries which is more than I can say for a great many software/hardware manufacturers. Cannot figure out why people become upset with a successful company like Microsoft and don't care to assasinate them as they have earned my respect by way of the service I have received. Guess I'm lucky and glad of it but think there is more to it than that.Users have much to do with it in their failure to either read or follow instructions. These machines are only as good as the person behind the keyboard. Enough verbosity, best wishes to you one and all. Remeber yesterday,enjoy today, live for tommorrow.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have a 1 year old computer,750MHZ,pentium III, 255MB ram, 20GB hd (with about 4gb of it used) and Windows ME absolutely WIPES IT'S BUTT with my machine! It crashes HARD if I open a program and move my mouse at the same time (even something as simple as notepad!) . And if I try to have a web browser and my email program open together - FORGET IT! You'll be making a big ME (MAJOR ERROR) if you choose to upgrade to WindowsME!. 

$$;
Summary:. I really have not had the difficulties that the majority of uses claim on this forum. I used Windows ME for the past several months and had few major problems other than the time I first attempted installation on my computer. That particular problem was that the Windows ME CD-ROM didn't have a device driver to run my video card(an ATI RAGE 128). Upon one of the several reboots during installation the screen came up dark and the process came to a halt. I solved the problem by going to Microsoft's website and getting the necessary information on another computer. I rebooted to safe mode and carried out the necessary instructions. Beyond that point Windows ME has worked ever since. I like the new color schemes and sounds. But even more satisfying is the system restore tool. This utility has help me on more than one occasion. I love it!! I have not noticed any slow down in running applications. It appears to work as well as it has under Windows 95 OSR 2.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have seen many negative reviews of Windows ME because of stability issues. I have run ME for a year and a half and other than re-intalling the OS 3 times (which went smoothly each time) it has worked rather well. The majority of users have problems because they do not understand there are programs running in the background causing conflicts. Definitely disable System Restore and Univeral Plug and Play through Control Panel. Also do not run real-time virus scanners as they slow down your system and cause crashes. Use msconfig.exe to turn off programs that shouldn't be loading at boot. (Schedulers, reminders, spyware) Regularly use Scandisk and Disk Defragmenter and you will have an acceptably stable OS. ME is still better than XP for games and I won't upgrade until they fix the compatibility issues.. 

$$;
Summary:. A great operating system. Windows me does not lock up on my computer. I installed it on a fat32 partition and I had no troubles, although I would recommend Windows xp Professional over Windows me. My system is a Celeron 1GHZ, 256 MB RAM, 10GB Samsung HD, Abit Siluro 32MB 3D Card &#38; Vibra Sound Card. 

$$;
Summary:. I have been using computers for 12 years . My first OS I used was MSDOS 6.22 in 1990 , since then I have continued to upgrade with each new Windows OS . Yes I agree Millennium has it's share of problems ! I have solved a lot of issues with the help of CNET's online help . For me I just keep an older PC running to run those older DOS games and older Windows OS's and other older apps . I cannot see staying in the past , the products that has changed our very society has had there share of problems ie. the car for example , was not perfect when it was invented ! I have had trouble when upgrading from Windows 95 &#38; 98 to Me , however , a clean install works fine for me !. 

$$;
Summary:. I was running Win 98 and I found it very unstable. It was always crashing or needing a format. With Win Me in I haven't had those problems. My computer rarely crashes, although I'm missing the boot into Dos function!!. 

$$;
Summary:. This isn't the most necessary upgrade you could find, but it's got some nice features that make it worth getting. System restore prevented boatloads of probs that would otherwise make me reformat my hard drive. XP is out now, though, so it's not really necessary.. 

$$;
Summary:. Me came installed in my PC an i Love it! I have had little to no problems. the restore didnt work the first time i needed it. Because i did not understand how it worked. other than that ..it been good to me.. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought my computer with ME installed and have had no problems. No blue screen. I love it. Sure it takes up disk space, but it is worth it. If you keep up you PC and get rid of useless files there are no problems. Get a grip people, it isn't that bad. Or maybe win 98 was so bad anything looks good. 

$$;
Summary:. I jumped from win 95 to ME and the difference in quality was not wqorth the cost.. 

$$;
Pros:. Better Interface on a fast computer Less security holes. 
Cons:. Hell getting newer hardware to work some bugs. 

$$;
Summary:. I keep my computer running all the time, and I've tried every OS on the market - Windows 98, Me, 2000, XP, even Linux. Me was by far the worse. I'd have to reboot every other day because everything would be slow and lag.. 

$$;
Summary:. I read with interest the negative comments about Win Me. It is true that stability of system is an issue, in particular when compared to Windows 2000 Pro. I run five computers in our research department, and lately we installed Windows XP on our latest April 2002 work station. What a disaster! Many apps would not work, in particular the software we are developing. Stability of Win XP is better than Win Me, but the price is heavy. If you are looking for performance &#38; reliability, don't buy XP. Try Win Me, or Windows 2000 Pro if you are not working with multimedia applications. In conclusion, we expected much from Win XP, but we had to be realistic (after three weeks of trials) and bought Win Me. The performance with Audigy &#38; latest ATI cards is absolutely breath-taking versus XP installation. Regards Fr�d�ric. 

$$;
Summary:. If You Want A Smoother System Use Windows ME But If You Want A Really Smooth System "Without Tons Of Errors" Use Windows 98 SE You Wont Regret It!. 

$$;
Summary:. I got a brand new 1.4 ghz Hp With Win Me Millenium Edition. I've only had one really bad problem. It Locks Up Almost Every Day; Usually in IE.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have a computer with window 98 on it and one with window Me the ME is not reliable and is slower. It has crashes several times in 10 months.. 

$$;
Pros:. System Restore. Runs okay on older pcs.. 
Cons:. Horrible reputation. I guess I got a good one.. 
Summary:. I've had experience to varying degrees with every MS OS since 98. I originally upgraded from 98 to Me waaaay back in 2001 or so because 98 was "supposed" to be getting support dropped/reduced by MS very soon. Well, that turned out to be a unfulfilled prophecy till July 2006 when ME got taken off support too. What was the point?. But then again MS is known for forced upgrades.. I don't recal my first ME install being much better or worse then my typical 98 experience. I would have gone with Win 2000 but my PC at the time would have needed more ram upgrades then I could afford compared to Me's somewhat more modest requirements.. Since then, I've had at least 2 or 3 more pcs given to me with ME preinstalled. Never had any problems with them beyond the usual Windows headaches. No better or worse then Win XP, 2000 or 98 as far as I'm concerned. Maybe because I've had the advantage of all the upgrades/service packs/patches which the early complainers never had the benefit of. I dunno.. But to me, it's basically 98se with System restore. I'd rather run 98se because it requires less juice to run ME but in this day and age, any machine made can run either one with no hardware overhead problems.. I do get blue screens once in a while but it doesn't crash everyday . It requires the same maintenance that any other MS os does, defrag, scandisk, and the occasional restore.. System Restore is the best feature on this thing. Basically an easier option to reformatting.. A fair to middling os (for me). I guess I was one of the luckier ones. It's still hard to overlook the fact that PC industry experts stil consider it one of the worst products of all time. LOL. I guess my versions all slipped past MS's "quality" control. Darn! Still can't believe what people pay for it on Ebay though. MS should be giving this thing away for free for "evaluation purposes" (See, it ain't as bad as people say it is ! It's just like Vista!). 

$$;
Summary:. when i bought a new pc, it shipped with a copy of windows me. i thought that windows me would perform well compared with my windows 95 pc back then. after a few months, it started to get blue screens, error messages, hangups and eventually restarting the pc automatically even if a left it for a while with no running apps. i wanna shift to the new windows xp but the thing is its quite costly.. i want my money back!!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded from 98 to ME soon after getting my new computer. I am getting a crash at least once a day and I am very religious about keeping my computer in optimal shape. Getting a new computer and XP cannot be worse.. 

$$;
Summary:. I purchased a P4 desktop with Win Me. Right out of the box, I noticed it was a resource hog. It induces a lot of memory leaks, requiring frequent system restarts. Upgrading the system memory from 128 MB to 384 MB only temporarily solved the problem. But it still exists.. 

$$;
Summary:. While ME supports better features then my old '95 it has crashed more times then my old '95 and 3.1 combined. It may look prettier but it doesn't work better.. 

$$;
Summary:. I recently bought a P4 PC with ME as the default OS for installation. I received multiple crashes daily until I disabled numerous elements from the config file. Since then, I still get an erroneous startup error dialog box indicating my monitor is in Power Save mode - it's not - that forces me to completely drain the CPU's power before restarting to successfully launch ME. Having worked with many Win OSs, I'd say ME is the worst. I'm waiting for XP in hope that it will clear this mess.. 

$$;
Summary:. After hearing online comments abt WinME, I tried for my 1st person experience. My conclusion is for whatever reasons, u should only use either Win98se or jump to Win2000 (or XP). Last summer when I brought my machine wth Win98se installed, it works fine even I overclocked my CPU alittle (&gt;10%) and operated +40 degrees. But now I had to put it back to the default settings just to keep the number of errors and crashes low. The reason being WinME is full of holes. My machine is operating at &gt;35 degrees and once in a short while (couple of days) WInME will give me so many BSOD (Blue Screen Of Death) that no matter how many times I reboot, I just can't get into Windows. Note, I hav a total of 896MB of RAM and I performed few changes (suggested by MS)on Windows setting as for physical memory greater than 512MB. The changes reduced fair amount of crashes and really helped to restore my machines original performance. But it is still unreliable.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows ME is one of the worst OS Microsoft ever did. It is slower then Windows 98 SE and Windows 95. It won't let you play all your games on it and so, if you are a big computer player, you should have Windows 98. But if you only use your computer for the web, your e-mails and your mp3, you should think about upgrading to Windows XP Home Edition (it runs 54% faster than Win ME). If you use your PC for devlopment and you want security and stability, you need to have Windows 2000 Pro or Windows XP Professionnal. Don't do the same mistake I did : DO NOT UPGRADE TO WINDOWS ME!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Introduced System Restore feature. 
Cons:. Not very stable. 

$$;
Summary:. I purchased a new PC last year and was overcome by the need to buy a new PC. Obviously I was somewhat excited and I never realized ME was part of the package. I can honestly say that Microsoft ME should take the product off the market to prevent inconveniencing their customers so badly. It crashed, froze, infected all my conacts, never connected to the www.. not for the full 1/2hr anyway. I'm sorry but I just had to add something here because I can't believe it's such an unstable OS and is still being marketed! Well.. XP certainly made up for it and gets top marks from me. Cassandra xx. 

$$;
Summary:. I didn't like Windows ME too much. It crashed more than any other OS I've ever owned. I recommend you move to XP. That's what I did and I LOVE it.. 

$$;
Summary:. I rather go back to Windows 95 than upgrade my OS to ME. It's the slowest OS and the OS with the greatest amount of errors. If you have Windows 95/98/98SE stick with it or your just gonna waist your money.. 

$$;
Summary:. Seems in most instances shut down, end task doesn't respond, nor does cntrl alt delete. Have considerable problems with internet explorer showing error messages, as well doing a file folder search.. 

$$;
Summary:. I used to have this and now I have Windows XP it's much better. ME is slow it has a lot of problems not so much bugs, but a lot of problems it always gives you trouble don't get this!! If your not ready to upgrade to XP stay with 98, becuase ME is horrible.. Windows Media player is free to download so it's not really that much of a feature. It's like X-box yeah X-box is good, but get a PC. ME is ok, but XP is better and so is 98 and 2000. Bottom line it's not worth your money if your computer comes with it and you don't want to upgrade well prepare to face problems..... UPGRADE OR STAY WITH 98......... 

$$;
Summary:. I waited 2 years (after 98) for what? A prettier yet less stable extension to the 9x family. The best feature about this OS is system restore which is needed because you're going to do alot of restoring especially if you bought the upgrade. I know you've read mixed reviews about XP but do yourself a favor, skip this OS and try XP Home if you want stability and features in one package.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have never had a computer freeze up so much as I did with Windows ME. I now have a new system with Windows 98SE, and it works far better and is incredibly more reliable than Windows ME.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have ME on a new Hp desktop. Reformmated the hard drive and reloaded the OS without all the HP crab. Now 90% of the time when I open outlook express I get a blue screen. NO OTHER SOFTWARE IS ON MY COMPUTER. That a joke. I am really disappointed.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have a new DELL 1.7Ghz and a Nvidia Gforce 64MB and 256MB, With windows Me you can not play you aold games and even on the new games like DUNE or Diablo 2 crashes all the time. It seems that runs out of memory very fast, I thinking of formating computer and intalling 98... slow booting but I get to play games with out crashes. If you have any information that can help please e-mail me.. 

$$;
Pros:. None whatsoever.. 
Cons:. Very instable.. 
Summary:. Either stick with Windows 98SE or go with Windows 2000/XP. This is just MS trying to sell 98SE users an "upgrade" they don't need and actually causes more problems than it solves.. 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using win98se hours a day for the last week with only a couple of reboots. On the same system, winme drove me nuts with hangs and error messages despite several reinstalls. I had less problems with windows 3.1.. 

$$;
Summary:. Basically since ME was installed on my machine I have been having problems after problems after problems. It crashed like every 5 seconds, I have downloaded all of the windows updates which seemed to make it worse! My advise is that unless you like looking at those 'bluse screens of death' DO NOT GO WITHIN 100 MILES OF IT!. 

$$;
Summary:. It is bad. I am in the graphics business, and you have to re-boot it every 20-25 minutes. The virtual memory slowly decreases from the time you restart your computer, to the time it reaches near zero. To fix the problem you have to restart the computer every time the virtual memory reaches zero. It is annoying and it is very easy to loose information. I'd suggest getting a newer version of Windows.. 

$$;
Summary:. My PC that I bought way back in Dec of 2000 came with WinME. And boy does it SUCK!!! Its very unstable and has totally crashed on me several times (I think the count is 4 or 5 now). In fact I need to reinstall it now-its giving me this WebPro 32 error over and over. I've worked with Windows 95, 98, and XP and I can safely say this is the worst version ever. Stay far, far away. Stick with 98 or better yet XP.. 

$$;
Summary:. WBEM (web based enterprise management) utilizes a file named "WINMGMT.EXE" in C. Windows(System(WBEM that is a frequent cause of the well-known ME lockup problem. You can drag that file out of its lair, drop it somewhere safe, and enjoy much greater stability. Only apparent drawback is that the System Information tool is unavailable while winmgmt is out of town. Easy to fix by just temporarily restoring it to original folder. Why the #$&#38;% did MS hardwire this dog into the OS??? And why is it such a hassle to get real mode DOS working again???. 

$$;
Summary:. I usually love Microsoft products. This, however, just doesn't cut it. The stability is horrible, getting errors to about everything (even with 160 MB of memory I still couldn't startup!). Also, most of the stuff on it is already free. Windows 98 users, stay with it.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have been using Windows 3.x, 95, 98, 98SE, 2000 PRO, XP home and Pro, Mandrake and Red Hat linux, but Win ME is absolutely the worst one. Crash, crash and crash: Win ME is nothing but "CRASHES".. 

$$;
Summary:. I thought Win98 was unstable until I got my new PC with Win ME. This is the worst OS I've ever had on a computer.It seems to race over a cliff to oblivion whenever I have the PC on for more than a couple of hours. So much so, that I've become very intimate with the scandisk function and cold reboot. If only my s/w would all work with Win XP. Arrrrgh!. 

$$;
Summary:. Microsoft's XP teaser, also known as Windows ME, is a pathetic attempt to make more money off the old Win 9x OS. Win 98SE and WinXP are the ONLY Microsoft OS programs that should be put on a PC.. 

$$;
Summary:. Okay, here is the deal-I had windows ME on for about 1 year, and now it's of. Had two complete computercrashes every time I ran a virtual environment-like Petx3 or something. Well, I finally called DELL after the second crash last week, and was given the low down. ME is seriously flawed against 98 in that there is NO DOS COMPATIBILITY! If you run any type of program running some form of DOS application-which games like Mech Warrior and Petx do-it slowly corrupts you file system to the point of being beyond repair. So, if you think you will run any software that was not made for the ME platform-stay with 98 only.. 

$$;
Summary:. This program definitely conflicts with older programs with screen freezes and screen image change is nice, but overall is not worthing spending the money. Stay with you Win 98 if that's what you are using.. 

$$;
Summary:. When I tried to install some software to control my creative soundblaster live sound card the sound went off! When I tried to reinstall the drivers the system went crazy and it started installing drivers for hardware that was already installed causing multiple hardware conflicts. And after all the worst of it is that when I try to remove one or more of these double entries it will automatically reinstall itself upon restarting. I am simply disgusted!. 

$$;
Summary:. I got ME with my computer and I don't like it. Yeah, some things are faster, but some things are slower too. I keep having it crash on me, sometimes explorer will just decide to quit working. If I were you I'd look at getting a better OS than this piece!!. 

$$;
Summary:. terribly unstable with crashes occuring all the time. nothing to brag about besides having a new version of win 98 with terrible reliability and stability. Performance in terms of rebooting and starting up has improved ever so slightly.. 

$$;
Summary:. Not only is this a more bloated version of windows 98, it also has the "benifit" of trying to hold you rhand even more. It drains massive amounts of system resources, and its restore feature can easily be infected by viruses, but not so easily cleaned. All in all a bad OS.. 

$$;
Pros:. it does have a few things i like better then 98 and it gives you something to do that is if you like repairing your computer all the time but hey it was cheap and all that i could afford so i guess i cant complain its worth the little bit of mony i paid f. 
Cons:. It has many problems in it that i still havent figured out yet but it gives me something to do but can really make me mad i still want 2000 or XP and i have found that some problems can be fixed but you have to know what your doing to find where to fix th. 

$$;
Summary:. since we got this new computer,(about a year ago)we have had nothing but problems. Am going to upgrade to xp. 

$$;
Summary:. In July 2001 I bought a new PC that came with Windows Me preinstalled. That's when the problems started. I ended up reformatting the hard drive after the first week. In November 2001 I experienced a catastrophic crash when the automated Windows Update kicked in while I was playing pinball - the hard drive became unbootable. And that was not the end of my problems. Every few months I would have to reformat and start from scratch. The only upside to Windows Me is that it really instilled in me the discipline to back up my files regularly. When I bought the system, a buddy nicknamed it "the god machine", a reference to the powerful hardware. It turned out to be a very accurate name, but because I lived in fear of it. In October 2002, I took it back to the store and demanded they install Windows 2000, which they did. Windows 2000 was the best $300 I ever spent, while Windows Me was the worst mistake I ever made!. 

$$;
Summary:. When i install a Virus Scan, it always get a blue screen when you do something. This OS is not worth upgrading.. 

$$;
Summary:. Like it at first for its restoring feature but now, there's too many freezes and most of all, no buit-in fax program like in Win98 (and finding one for free is almost impossible!). Support is crappy since release of WinXP.. 

$$;
Summary:. Constant Crashes/freeze ups at the click of the mouse. It can happen at any time. C/A/D wouldn't even work at times when trying to Shut down. I would actually have to power off. Doing that caused problems on boot up Boot up/on the internet or just running an application. Many of my friends have the same system and have the same complaints. I will go back to 98. I would never reccommend this O/S to anyone.. 

$$;
Summary:. My system has crashed at LEAST once per day. It can't handle simple things like printing (to an HP) and opening a web browser reliably. This is laughably bad, but this is the quality of product you can expect when there is no competition. I had much better luck with Win95 and my MAC before that (and OS/2 before that). 

$$;
Summary:. Browsing this site and learning that 80% of ME users have the same teeth-gnashing problems I have with the !@#$% program was like learning in high school I wasn't the only one sporting a zit. Millennium indeed! First millennium, maybe.. 

$$;
Summary:. ME is woorking slower and slower. (Even with more RAM.) Too many reeboots. and..."#@!#@ If ME was a demo, it could have been OK. Not worth the money!. 

$$;
Summary:. We have 3 networked PC's at home, they run 98SE, ME and XP. I have the ME on an HP (Celeron 900 with 256 M Ram). This operating system started crashing out of the box before it was networked. I have never gone a full day without multiple crashes, often requiring a cold shut down. It is the worst performing piece of commercial software (OS or otherwise) I have ever seen. Now I will decide between a full restore or a move to XP. Yes, I have my seat belt on.. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought a new HP computer with windows ME loaded on it and I was gettign the blue screen many times a week i added 256 mb RAM and the problems were almost bearable but still somtimes it would take 2 or 3 boots just to get it working and thenonce finally working i would suffer many system lockups I finally got XP....whew now that is a stable operating system! Dont waste any money on Windows ME, as a matter of fact Windows ME users should sue microsoft for a free upgrade to Windows XP because ME is a Lemon!.

Summary:. Having only worked with the very stable Win2000 Professional, I never really understood Windows' reputation for crashing and general instability. Never, that is, until I got Windows ME for my brand-new home PC. Quite frankly, it is terrible. The features are fine, although I miss some of the flexibility of Win2000 Pro, but the real problem is the fact that Windows ME has managed to turn the joy of using my first home PC into seemingly endless loops of frustration and repeated cold reboots. I am amazed and shocked at the zeal with which this OS grabs any opportunity to crash my PC. I've barely got anything installed on it, and freezes and crashes are a constant annoyance. Memory management is non-existent. Windows ME has finally convinced me that I should look into Linux as a viable alternative for a desktop PC. Not recommended.. 

$$;
Summary:. Just freezes up. Re-boots by it's self. Had to re format the hard drive 4 times now and lost everything. Don't even think about this OS.. 

$$;
Summary:. MY SYSTEM FREEZES AT LEAST 2 TIMES DAILY. SYSTEM SHUTS DOWN OR RESTARTS BY ITSELF HAVE TROUBLE WITH INSTALLING OR RUNNING A LOT OF GAMES OR SOFTWARE. 

$$;
Summary:. Causes my computer to freeze up alot. Doesn't seem to have that many enhancements that at least for the features I use, I don't see any improvement over 98. Now I'm stuck with all the freeze ups and no upside. Boooooooooooooo! I hate it!. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows ME has frozen on me so many times, If I so much as add a new program or install a new peripheral, it will freeze. When I tried to remove the peripherals from the device manager it kept freezing on me again. Better off with Windows 98!. 

$$;
Summary:. I've had nothing but problems since I've brought my brand new computer home. Windows Me was pre-installed into the system and has been a thorne in my side ever since. At first I thought it was the hard drive and I brought it back to the store to have it looked at. The friendly techie explained that it was the Windows Me, that there were numerous errors in the program and for $100 more I could upgrade to the Windows NT. Why are stores putting this junk into computers, knowing it's garbage!! $$$$$$$. 

$$;
Summary:. I bought an HP7920 with windows ME on sept.2nd, two days later I got the blue screen of death.Windows wouldn't boot.All I got was the HP invent screen.I returned it and got another.This lasted 32 days until it happened again.I returned it to Comp USA,they pronounced it fixed the next day.That night it died again.This time HP built me a new computer.When I picked that up it worked fine until I restarted it after adding AOL(5 whole minutes)And once again I was greeted by the blue screen,and no windows.I brought it back to Comp USA,explained it all to the manager,and he agreed to give me a store credit even though it was beyond their 14 day return policy.Comp USA gets an A+ Microsoft gets an F,and I get an HP7955 with windows XP.Wish me luck. 

$$;
Summary:. Too many blue screens and seemingly no way to find the cause or the solution to what's happening.. 

$$;
Summary:. How much time/room do I have? Have had so many problems with it that I feel decidedly cheated. Freezes/crashes for fun. Wish I stuck to '98!. 

$$;
Summary:. If you want instability in a new PC, just buy the most expensive HP around, pre-installed with Windows ME. If your wondering about technical supprt...it's only slightly more stable than the OS. With HP, you'll get 3 different techs, 3 different opinions. None of them correct. Get a hold of Windows 98 or 2K, and save yourself lots of headaches mr friends!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. I had a freeze in 98se, and I bought this hoping to repair. crashed my system on install so screwed up the registry i had to do a clean install and it took me a week to get all my programs reinstalled and various tweaks back to where I like them. never did fix the problem and I wasted $90 bucks.. 

$$;
Pros:. None whatsoever. 
Cons:. Win. 9X should have never been released. 
Summary:. In time every version of Win.9X gets worse. Only salvation is the NT kernel.. Let's talk about God's Kingdom.. gla_bella@hotmail.com. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows Me is horrible. It is probably the slowest os I have ever run. It crashed often and has a very low level of compatability. This would be my last choice for an os.. 

$$;
Summary:. IN TWO MONTHS OF USING THIS OS THE SYSTEM CRASHED ALMOST EVERY FORTNIGHT. IT WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR ME AS I KEPT RELOADING AND RELOADING.... I WAS VERY VERY HAPPY WITH WIN 98 AND HAD NO HEADACHES. MICROSOFT SUCKS.. THEY ARE NOT GIVING ANY SUPPORT ALSO FOR THIS PRODUCT ANY MORE....THE UPDATE SITE HANGS AND ALL THE TRICKS TO GET THE UPDATE WORK ..DO NOT WORK.. 

$$;
Summary:. I can't stand Windows ME. It's slow and crashes all the time. I don't like Macs either. I think that there should be a new OS to compete.. 

$$;
Summary:. If MS had released this before Win 95, We would all still be using Win 3.x. I have seen more errors in one day with ME, than I did in 7 YEARS with 95/98. 

$$;
Summary:. Only after months got Dell with ME sorted out. Lockups order of the day. Gateway lockups every day. Gates was a greedy crook in the 70's but at least he only stole other people's software then. Do not use ME. It was just a means to get extortion money from you and me.. 

$$;
Summary:. I will have to agree with mo and ranthos... "Windows ME users should sue microsoft for a free upgrade to Windows XP because ME is a Lemon!" (quoted from ranthos' review). ME constantly hangs. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted just waiting for it to return control to me, or having to reboot 'cause it simply wouldn't. In addition, every time I run Windows Explorer, when I go to shut down the system, the explorer task will not end, no matter how many times I click "end task". Then I have to hold the power button in to do a hard shutdown. You would think a Microsoft OS should be able to run a Microsoft application. This OS is the worst practical joke that Microsoft has perpetrated on the computer-using public so far!. 

$$;
Summary:. Is 1 as low as we can go. Must have been paying to much attention to the court battle?. 

$$;
Summary:. its undoubtedly the memory drain which makes Windows ME totally useless as a commercial tool. Any suggestion by Microsoft that it is is at best misleading and at worst fraudulent. 

$$;
Summary:. I'll never understand what I've done to Mr. Gates to deserve this. Why is this the most poorly realized, horrific invention ever? Windows Me doesn't actually run programs, it just puts up screens between crashes. And what's the deal with the system resources? I can't run the ^%$&#38;ing computer longer than 6 hours without it going all buggy. Listen: I actually reinstalled 98 SE, after FORMATTING MY HARD DRIVE JUST TO GET RID OF Millenium Edition. This must've been that year 2000 bug they were talking about... I just didn't think it'd come in the form of an entire operating system.. 

$$;
Summary:. really unstable. crashes and hangs frequently. i bought a new pc with 'me' pre-installed and despite far more ram, far more processing power in the new machine, my old pc with 95 worked far better. this one is a dud, don't do it.. 

$$;
Summary:. The Operating system crashes too often, and is to unstable during startup and shutdown. Definately not a good choice for Digital Video editors.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is the worst operating system I ever came across. I have Win XP now and it's much better. I had to reformat my hard drive at least 10 times this year. It restarted itself often and I eventually had to switch to Windows 98 SE. ME started quicker but Win 98 ran quicker once it was was loaded. Give it a while and Microsoft will deny ever making this. My advice: get Windows 98 SE. Try XP if you can afford and your system can handle it.. 

$$;
Summary:. First off, this is not your typical OS... it runs so slow... even on a PIII 933Mhz with 256Mb of RAM... why is this??? It crashes way more than Win98... or even Win95 for that matter! "Living in a digital world" - Win ME moto... ha, like that really proves anything. More like garbage world if u ask me! Stick to Win98SE or get Win2000... both of these offer far more stability and performance.. 

$$;
Summary:. I seriously don't like ME. It is making me very mad I threw my computer out the window the other day because of this product. I go through about 10 computers a year.. 

$$;
Summary:. Me is terrible. I hate this OS. I can't wait for xp... oh wait I have xp! Hoody Hoo! XP doesn't have the constant freezes that me has. I've had this computer running for the last 12 hours and now slow up... that is much better than me. I could barely go for 10 without a freeze or two. Me is terrible!. 

$$;
Summary:. Just as the above says... tried Windows ME, thinking that it would be an improvement over Win 98, but it was a WASTE OF TIME!!! First of all, I was greeted by a blue screen after rebooting from setup (didn't microsoft say that no blue screens were to exist in Windows ME???) And second of all, Adaptec Easy CD stopped working. Further more, Norton Antivirus 2001 stopped working, as well as some of my other apps. This is not what an OS should do to your computer!!! DO NOT GET WINDOWS ME... GET WINDOWS 2000 INSTEAD!!!.
