i like to be balanced as a regular reviewer so there are positives and some feedback for staff as first impressions count for a lot !
we were celebrating our anniversary in beautiful bourton on the water which is only 90 minutes from the midlands so an ideal mini break stop over .
check in was 2pm and we arrived around 20 minutes early with quite a few bags from the car park which is tiny .
we got there early as we have a brand new car only a few weeks old and did n't want to leave it on the road and there are only around ten spaces .
i went to reception which was unmanned and tried to check in and was told rather abruptly to come back at 2pm which is fine but there was no offer to take our bags and store them we had to struggle into the bar with all the bags so we had a drink .
i got the impression that the staff here have to multi task : one minute they are waitressing then expected to deal with arriving guests so it 's a bit disjointed .
we went back at 5 past 2 and a very pleasant young man checked us in .
rooms were fairly basic and ours was a little tired looking especially the bathroom .
that said the room was quiet with lovely comfy beds so we had a good nights sleep .
we had a meal in . . .

we had a meal in the restaurant and the young waiter was lovely extremely helpful and we enjoyed our meal very much .
breakfast was a nice hot meals served to order and as we were leaving we saw some of the other rooms which were being cleaned and had obviously been refurbished so some rooms are obviously better than others .
on balance i would stay here again but perhaps ask for one of the newer rooms.
