0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, July 6, 2009
When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .
directions routing are perfect .
Directions were easy to see and understand .
spoken directions are crystal clear .
My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .
The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .
Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
It loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when I miss a turn .
Some of the verbal directions :
So, although the Nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, I can look at the screen to see the exit I need to take .
No more stopping at so and so gas stations for directions .
The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .
You also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and programmable POIs .
but for the most part, we find that the Garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .
There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .
It was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .
Garmin's nuvi 255W   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .
