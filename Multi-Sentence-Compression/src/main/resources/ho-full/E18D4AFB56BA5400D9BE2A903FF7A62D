the location was in close walking distance to the beach , and was very safe .
also located close to the outlets , and some stores .
however , it is not in walking distance , and their staff will tell you it is .
you need to rent a car if you plan to experience maui even in the slightest , as the location is not convenient for walkers .
you might even need a car to go to the beach .
the location is very nice and clean , rooms are serviced often , however room services barley changed the towels or gave new ones , and also very oddly replaced bed sheets .
i stayed there for 12 days , and i think we got a full clean of the room one time .
the website said there was free breakfast included , and when we brought it up to management , they were rude and did not care to help us .
alongside the website , when i called ahead of time to confirm the booking , they said that they upgraded two of our rooms to the two bedroom , and upon check in they said it was never said .
their communication was poor , and the owner/manager was rude and not easy to deal with .
if this situation with knowing that we needed a car , the breakfast , and the upgrade situation , i would recommend this hotel to everyone , as it was convenient .
i also recommend to book excursions privately , and not through the person in the lobby , . . .
