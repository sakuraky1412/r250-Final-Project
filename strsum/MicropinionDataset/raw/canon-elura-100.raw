Pros:. I have owned the Elura 100 for about 2 mos. and love it. The stills are great quality also. I have no idea why some are complaining about camera noise - mine is very quite. Don't know where you wil. 
Cons:. NONE - I HAVE LOOKED HARD BUT FOUND NONE.. 
Summary:. All around excellent product and a joy to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great optics, feature rich, easy to use and perfect size. 
Cons:. None that I have noticed. 
Summary:. I want to write this review to squelch the complaints about motor noise interfering with sound. When I first began my investigation, of which digital video to purchase, I was skeptical due to the user reviews about the motor noise interfering with the sound recording. I was allowed to test the camera before purchase and while the motor noise was noticeable it did not seem that it would interfere with audio. I decided to purchase the camera. After purchasing the camera, recording and playing back on the camera as well as on the T.V. the motor noise is not evident to my ears or anyone else that watches/listens. My opinion is this is a perfect camera for my use taping my sons football &#38; basketball games and my daughters gymnastics &#38; hockey games and indoor family events. Indoor lighting has produced more than acceptable video for us and taping on sunny days produces perfectly rich looking video. My hats off to Canon!. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent quality,easy to handle it,good looking. 
Cons:. Hand strap is somewhat uncomfortable, on off switch is little bit uncomfortable. 

$$;
Pros:. toplading tape deck, superb video, decentl stills, well built, compact, mic port. 
Cons:. charger plug, sd card placement, internal battery,. 
Summary:. Stop ! Are you considering to purchase a camcorder that records to dvd or harddrive? well unless your watching the video unedited on a 13inch tv then Mini DV is the way to go. Right off the bat, I did consider the issue with motor noise before purchasing it. Yes its bad but any basic audio cleaner will do wonders. The first thing that stuck in my mind was the small size. It is so small you could fit it in your jean pocket. to many great things to say.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Good Video, good battery life. 
Cons:. Need firewire Card to Capture Video. No video Softwr.. 
Summary:. would replace this one with sameone if need arose. Low light not too good but does OK in a pinch. Lack of supporting Video software a minus. Expensive to buy. Also Hard to find the one that is ease to use. Had to buy a Firewire PCI Card so I could capture Video. Still from SD Card download OK with supllied USB Cable. Best Still photo I have ever taken was with this camera on a 1 GB SD Card using Telephot lens.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video in every condition (dark and ligth), Compact Size, Easy to use, Widescreen format, Low cost, Easy connectivity to a TV, Proven Brand. 
Cons:. The flash light feature tends to wash out colors in the dark, No firewire cable included (but who does), Buttons might seem small to some people.. 
Summary:. The camera has beet great so far. I have owned it for several months and it works great. I also use it as an analogue to digital video converter, to transfer old VCR tapes to my PC and then to DVD. I intended to by this item for myself, but since it is so easy to use and the build quality is so great, my wife decided that she would use it all the time. All-in-all it was a great deal. Awesome Video recording quality and Easy to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light weight, good - great video, good joy stick control, and it is very sturdy.. 
Cons:. The joy stick is a little far to the left and the spotlight is almost blinding.. 
Summary:. I would really recommend this camera, especially if you want a camera with good video under $400.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight, cost, quality, and ease of use. 
Cons:. Might be to small for people with large hands. Focus on digital zoom not great. 
Summary:. After much research, I bought this camera for $306. Havent had a new video camera for over 10 years and was surprised at how much smaller they have become. Found it a pleasant surprise and came with so many features! And the price is right!. I found the wide screen function great. The zoom focused great except when going past the optical zoom (20x) into the digital range (up to 800x). In my opinion anything past 20-25x zoom would be to shaky anyway. Battery is super small and lasts a long time. The buttons were well placed, however, if my hands were any larger, I would have difficulty since the camera is so small...but the trade off is worth it.. I have read reviews about the motor noise concerns, I have not noticed this at all so maybe it might be a defect in some cameras.. Performs best when out door shooting. In door shooting can be a little dark but still acceptable.. Overall the Elura 100 is priced right and worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. very good picture quality, decent zoom, image stabilization, excellent battery life,. 
Cons:. low light performance needs to be better. 
Summary:. for the price this cam is the best (beter than the sony's hc26/46 for sure). it is very compact, the battery life is excellent ( i got 160 mins on single charge with LCD use at lower brightness and frequent power ups). the image quality under normal light is crisp. very good color preproduction and the image stabilliztion works decent. 1/5" CCD (others are usually 1/6"). true widescreen.. cons: the low light videos are slightly grainy (but for the price you cant expect more) the led lights are not enough for anything further than 2 ft.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to operate. 
Cons:. needs more pixels for stills. 
Summary:. This camcorder is great looked around for sometime c-net helped make my decision,i have large hands and i love this camcorder,many features that i will use. 

$$;
Pros:. BEAUTIFUL VIDEO/ WITH VARIOUS SETTING OPTIONS. 
Cons:. NOT SO GREAT STILL FOTOS. 
Summary:. I GOT THIS CAMCORDER THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY, JUST IN TIME FOR MY CRUISE VACATION, AND I MUST SAY THAT THIS PALM SIZED LITTLE CHAMPION OF A CAMCORDER DID A FABULOUS JOB OF CAPTUREING MY VACATION MEMORIES. THE 20X OPTICAL ZOOM IS WONDERFUL FOR ZOOMING IN ON OTHERWISE HARD TO GET SHOTS. THE ANTI-SHAKE FEATURE IS ALSO A BIG HELP. IN SHORT I DID MY HOMEWORK AND I MUST AGREE WITH CNET, THIS IS A WONDERFUL BUDGET PRICED CAMCORDER WITH EXPENSIVE CAMCORDER RESULTS.READ THE MANUAL. AND GET YOURSELF ADOBE PREMIERE ELEMENTS.

$$;
Pros:. A lot of great features, simple to learn, great quality. 
Cons:. Handling issues. 
Summary:. Overall, I am very satisfied with the Elura 100 and the camcorder was actually better than what I expected. Battery life is amazing, although internal batteries aren't supposed to last long. Quality of the videos are great for the price, and the pictures are pretty sharp. Also, many people complain about motor noise but to me, it wasn't much of a problem.. Handling was a bit of a struggle, however, as the camcorder is small and my hands are rather large.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Menus, Upload Video &#38; Photo to PC, Widescreen, Decent in low light and Amazing in good light, lightweight, long last battery, wireless remote, great zoom and image stability, Great Overall Value. 
Cons:. Placement of W/T Zoom for people w/big hands, does not include firewire cable, color viewfinder is a plus but neck of viewfinder is short and not very comfortable.. 
Summary:. I researched like most people do for quite some time and decided on this model as the camcorder that offered all the great features available, good performance of actual recording and was most affordable. I ended up purchasing from an online store for $314.00 including shipping and tax compared to $409.00 at my local electronics store.. I've been playing around with the camera for a few days now and I still have much to learn about it though nothing seems too overwhelming. The Manual is very clear and simple. You can record in widescreen or regular depending on what type of TV you have at home. You can take a still photo while you are recording video without any interruption to the video. You can also go back through the playback of one of your videos and record a still image later. Included is the video cable so you can connect and watch your videos on the tv, then sit back on your couch and control the camera w/the wireless remote. Probably the best feature is being able to upload to your PC w/the included USB so you can burn your movies to DVD. (Assuming you have a DVD burner on your PC. If not you can also burn using a DVD burner and your TV.). For recording in different light situations there are 9 different modes that all help w/focus and clarity. Specially like NIGHT mode that helps a lot in low light situations. Makes recording w/as little as a reading lamp possible if needed. There's also a "fireworks" mode that I plan on using on my upcoming trip to Disney during Independence weekend. Also has 9 different ways to fade in and out of recording along w/9 different special effects for recording such as black &#38; white and sepia. Navigating back and forth between different modes is very easy as there is not too much bunched up in the menu. Also, navigating is mostly w/the joy stick that is really cool and makes it easy to work your way around. (Sony and their touch LCD screens sound cool but seemed more difficult and harmful to the screen. Waiters sometimes struggle entering your order onto a 20inch screen. Your camcorder screen is 2.7 inches people!). Color viewfinder helps for recording in extra bright situations where the LCD screen might not look so well, though this LCD screen out performs the color, brightness and clarity of many other similar camcorders. The 20X zoom is more than enough to zoom to objects more than a city block away. Obviously you might not need to do that very often but just imagine how well it can perform for objects within close/average range. The batter is hidden inside where the LCD screen opens from to keep it from getting bulkier on the outside. Audio has two options, regular and extra sensitive. Both are good depending on the situation. LCD light is very bright to look at but it does help a bit in low light situations. I have yet to see a camera w/an excellent light on this type of camera. You'll have to go back to the old VHS cameras for a good light. If needed, there are mounts available for sale on the net to add an extra light for about $20 though they dont look very attractive in terms of appearance. All of the jacks for charging, viewing, cards and batteries are all hidden or blend in to keep it looking sleek inside and out. Go out to your local store and pick up and handle all the cameras available. Many, specially those by Samsung and JVC seem to be made of cheap plastic. The Canon is very solid and sturdy that makes you feel like you have a higher end camcorder. Which in terms of what you get, you practically do have a higher end camcorder. There is also a cover that slides over the lens to protect it.. Now the negatives.The viewfinder, though it is in color which is good, does not have any kind of extension or comfort piece for your eye socket. You literally place the camera on your face. For some this might actually be a positive though so it's up to you. The strap is not as big or attractive as the Sony strap. This was my wife's only complaint. She didnt care so much about the specs as she did about how it looked. I do agree w/her though that it could probably be a little bigger. I found it easier to not use the strap and instead put my hand over the strap in order to get a good grip angle on the Zoom lever. Which means the zoom lever may be the only piece that could benefit from being moved or enlarged a bit. Specially for folks w/bigger hands or long fingers. Still this is not enough of a problem for me to even complain about it. All of the other features plus the ability to find it just over $300 is more than I can ask for.. 

$$;
Pros:. LCD Quality, 16:9 compatible, price, image quality, zoom function, ease-of-use, small size. 
Cons:. No Firewire included, Noise from tape mechanism, image stability control not great, included light leaves a blue tint on video. 
Summary:. I'm new to the digital camcorder world, but have wanted one for a long time. My wife and I went to Los Cabos, Mexico and decided it was the right time to purchase one. We decided on this model after seeing Consumer Reports' ratings of the Elura 85 and 90. Both were highly rated and the 100 is no different in my opinion.. Out of the box, the camcorder is easy to use. I especially liked the precise zoom and autofocus functionality. I was also very impressed with the LCD image quality. The light weight and compact design made for a comfortable fit in my hand.. The image quality of the video is excellent. Some sites claim it's "HR" or "high resolution" and it may well be, but I didn't notice too much of a difference between this and other non-HR cameras, although they were more expensive in general. I love the true widescreen LCD display, and it translated perfectly to our widescreen TV at home. I just recently discovered the effects built into the camera's software. Some of them are kind of cheesy, but would probably be really cool to see if you're kid.. The controls are very easy to use once you get the hang of them. On-screen graphics make them easy to navigate and after about an hour of use I felt comfortable with them.. The only gripes I have with the camera are:. - The noise from the tape mechanism. During recording of quiet footage, you can hear the "buzz" of the tape, but it's only noticable during very low-noise recording.. - Image stability was less than stellar. Although good, the image stability control was not always up to snuff. I'm basing this on use during activities, though. For example, we did an ATV excersion and I was able to record while riding. I don't think any camera could have recorded this without shakiness but with this camera it was almost unwatchable. Again, not having a lot of experience with these things I don't have anything on which to compare it. But even during casual strolls along the resort we were staying it seems to bounce around a little. Holding it with two hands helped a lot, so it may be just that my hand shakes too much or that I am jarring my arm downward when I walk. Not a major issue for me.. - The included spotlight, while great for low-light environments, leaves a bluish tint on anything being recorded. This is a luxury anyway, since many cameras don't seem to have a light included on them. Still, the picture quality takes a hit from this light but you're not expecting great quality during low-light recording anyway.. - A big grip for me is that there's only a USB cable included - no firewire. I could be wrong but I believe the ONLY way to tranfer video directly from the camera to a computer is via a firewire connection and if this is the case it should have been included with the camera. I had to go out a buy a firewire card with the cable in order to transfer video to my PC, and it works nicely.. This is a great camera, and beginners will definitely appreciate its inuitive controls. I recommend this camera for anyone wanting a low-cost, full-featured camcorder who doesn't mind a little background noise during certain recording environments.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fairly priced, good pic quality, small, true widescreen (not HD) format. 
Cons:. may be too small for some, viewfinder almost unusuable. 
Summary:. I've used this camcorder for a few days now and have to say I am utterly impressed:. - It records fantastic images under bright light.. - Even in "dim" conditions (hardly any daylight/just a few lamps) it records excellent images.. - It is very small and portable. Any smaller and it just wouldn't be usable. The buttons are well laid out and easy to use for my wife with small/average size hands and me with my bigger hands. Do note though that the camera is very small and sometimes you will have a hrad time shooting steady video, if holding it with only one hand. I usually just use my other hand to steady it holding the LCD screen.. - Some users complain that it feels "cheaply built" or even "flimsy". I don't share that opinion at all. It's just that it is made of plastic and light weight.. - Very good battery life, even when using the LCD screen all the time. The little viewfinder doesn't extend and is almost unusable. They could have honestly skipped it and just made the camcorder another $50 cheaper.. - The lens cover is built in, so no chance of it going awol ever again!. - Records in true widescreen (can be switched to 4:3 in a heartbeat though). Most camcorders in this price range will just chop your 4;3 image and make it look like 16:9. So although the Elura 100 doesn't record in HD (which at this time costs another $1k) it is somewhat "future-proof" to watch your home video on your next TV purchase (most likely a HDTV) and make full use of all it's "real estate".. - Features Analog-to-Digital passthrough. While most camcorders in this price class skip that feature, the E100 allows you to convert your old analog videos to digital format and enjoy them for years/decades to come.. - Some people complain of motor or a clicking noise, I have not noticed either. Makes me think Canon had some birthing problems with the first run of these.. I've done a lot of comparing, trying to decide between 3ccd, HD and so forth. The Elura 100 in my opinion allows me to shoot great video now at a very economical price (#329 delivered) and I won't feel bad when I upgrade to the next generation HD camcorder in a few years.. 

$$;
Pros:. video light; sd card; long bat; great pix; nice video. 
Cons:. too thick to grip. 
Summary:. i purchased one elura 100 from dell.com when it went on sale $325; the design is very compact, with battery under the lcd, open /eject button on the top, overall it is a smart design. on the performance, the still picture quality is startling good, at 1.33m it close to a digital camera picture; sd card feature is a great addition, i recorded 48 minutes out of 512mb sandisk sd mini card. video is just ok for viewing on computer. it blurs when changes to full screen. but 100% original size looks very nice. of course, if u use mini dv tape, then video palyback on tv is going to be fabulous. the one feature makes this camcorder stands out to others is two video lights for low light or dak condition, very bright light by the side of lens. battery life is 150m, compare to 90m of canon zr600. the only con is camcorder is thick that the back of my hands hurts by holding 5 minutes. i highly recommend this camcorder, same price as zr 700, and $50 more than zr600, it worthes every penny and this camcorder is much better than zr700 or zr600, i bought the zr600 and now have to ebay it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size and weight are light, the features are awesome considering the size. It has a stereo Mic input so you can use it as a sound recorder. It also has an analog to DV pass though feature to convert &#38; record old analog 4:3 video, integrated lens cap.. 
Cons:. I have a weird error after about a year of heavy use. The recording light is constantly blinking even when its off. The workaround for this is to pull the battery then switch the cam to the mode (CAM or VCR) of your choice, then put the battery in.. 
Summary:. I've brought this little camera all over the world with me and it has never failed (in regard to the work around error it still functions great) I has been dropped off tables splashed liquid on it and just overall used to the max. It still work's great and shoots like brand new, I would buy another if I had lost this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. quick to auto focus, simple to learn, great outdoors, okay indoors with good lighting, can attach a condenser mic, can use a tripod, does not need tripod if you are steady, sound is clear, view on tv!. 
Cons:. difficult for newbie to get to DVD on a PC, must buy firewire cord to download to PC, tapes can get bad if player not cleaned, led is a joke, need lots of light indoors.. 
Summary:. i got it at STAPLES in january 2007, before they changed their 110% pricematch policy in september. it cost me about $200!! i use sony tapes, which have been fine. like a tape player, you can ruin these tapes if over used...so download to DVD if you can! i just got a sony VRD-MC3 to make mine, because i just can't use an Apple. i took a simple fly-on-the-wall approach to my first recording. it was ALL indoors, and 97% was great! why? we had ample lamps and open windows for light. when i didn't catch the light, the pictures got muddy. sound in a crowded room is picked up from most all angles if using no separately held mic. but, unless done in a quiet small room, no motor noise. my next project was an outdoor b-day/reunion party at a park. the colors were vibrant, and i got smart at how to adjust my camera to catch the light under a roof! 99% was great! little editing will need done on that one. i am concerned over the cheaply made rubber covers for plugins. battery is spendy if you want to replace it or have a spare...which is nice. have not used photo yet, but i got an SD card that needs no reader, and it fit in fine. i was told that Canon will put out a newer version of this in a year or so. maybe we should email them our imput as to what we don't want to lose &#38; what we really need to have added?. 

$$;
Pros:. small, easy to use, good picture, good price. 
Cons:. Hand strap is somewhat uncomfortable, on off switch is cumbersome. 
Summary:. I really like this vidcam. It is my first one I have owned but I am very happy with it. It does not do the best in low lighting but any camara needs good light. I have not noticed any buzzing that I saw in other reviews.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sounds like a great product. 
Cons:. They're no longer available. 
Summary:. I have read ratings and reviews on this camcorder from a dozen different sources. Camcorder of the year, wonderful, the best, nothing comes close to the performance for the price, superb picture and so on.. Strangely, Canon seems at the top of their game in terms of engineering and product development, and at the bottom of their game in marketing and sales. It's no longer available, I've checked bizrate, pricescan, ecost, buy.com, gobs of places, not available, discontinued. It's the most popular model on CNET, and frequently given the nod over other similar Canon models like the Z700, Z800, Z850 and so on, and not available now.. Strangely, Canon seems to be exhibiting a lot of this strange, self-destructive behavior these days. Their printers are undergoing the same puzzling trends. The i560 and Pixma ip3000 were so good, and obtained nearly a cult following for price, value and reliability. Even though these printers used to sell NEW for as little as $65, they can now be found on Ebay and Amazon, when you can find them, even slightly used, selling for nearly $200, purchased by customers that are desparate to try to still find them. Meanwhile, go into Staples, Office Max, Best Buy and other stores, and you may not even be able to find a Canon printer on the store shelf, or if you do, you can observe many customers that are frustrated or confused by the endless model swaps and inability to find a model that they've read about or with which they are familiar. Why does Canon seem so intent on cannibalizing themselves?. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, compact size. 
Cons:. not the best in low light. 
Summary:. I consider myself technically saavy, but I wanted a camera that I could take out of the box and pretty much start using quickly without a lot of technical frustrations. I also do not need a camera loaded with features that I will never use. I will use this camera primarily to take family videos and transfer the footage the computer to edit and burn to DVD or post to a website. This camera has satisfied all of my requirements - user-friendly interface, great price, great quality and compatible with Macs. If you are looking for an easy-to-use camera for just shooting simple videos, I highly recommend this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Native widescreen, size, image quality. 
Cons:. No accessory shoe. 
Summary:. I've had a number of camcorders over the years (VHS-C, SVCS-C, Hi8, MiniDV). The last I had was a Canon ZR50, which has served me well for the past few years, but needs replacing because it's chewing up tapes (a problem with older ZR models and GL2, according to Google). After extensive research, I settled on the Elura 100 as a replacement. The motor noise issue was the one consistent complaint I heard about this camera. I did a side by side comparison of the Elura with my old ZR50, which definitely has a motor noise problem, to evaluate the issue.... The ZR50 produces a high-pitched whine throughout quiet scenes. By contrast, the noise picked up from the Elura is a lower tone that sounds like the camera is upping the gain to 'look for sound'. I found that if there is any significant sound in the room, then the gain is lowered and the motor noise all-but disappears. This is not the case with the ZR50 - the high-pitched whine is constantly there unless drained out by other noise. So through editing of the final video, the volume of the 'silent' scenes can be reduced to minimize Elura's motor noise. All in all, the Elura's noise is an improvement over the ZR50.. Using an external microphone in both cases is interesting. On the ZR50, the external mic picks up the high-pitched whine of the ZR50. With the Elura, it picks up nothing - the sound is almost totally silent. This brings up the one flaw of the Elura - no shoe. This is not a show stopper, since for $10 you can pick up a bracket that screws into the tripod thread. A little ungainly for such a small camera, but for concerts or suchlike, that's going to be my solution.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great color during daytime images, great sound, easy to use out of the box.. 
Cons:. Low light gives a lil grain, but nothing terrible. 
Summary:. One thing I like about this camcorder is it's small, lightweight, great daytime color and very high quality sound!. First off the images; when taking this on a sunny day, your color will be excellent! You get great detail as well as you take still images.. The microphone is very sensitive, it picks up things I didn't even hear at first, until playback you pick up things that you just noticed. Dogs barking, someone talking, music. As far as music, I taped someone playing and singing with a guitar, and it picked up some really great sound from the artist.. As far as peoples complaints for motor sounds, I'm mostly either editing the soundtrack, or recording events and stuff. So it doesn't really pick up the motor sounds at all. If you're into recording empty rooms with nothing happening, then maybe do some further review on the sound, for some people complain about it.. I LOVE the wide screen, it's true 16:9 and it captures a lot! I filmed a day on the beach with my boi and his dog in widescreen, and it picked up a lot of stuff in one shot.. It only gets me sometimes is the low light performance. You do get some grain in normal lighting settings, and if you slow the shutter speed, you'll get more light in evidentaly but play back makes images look a lil ghostly to me when I move around (but that's just me).. Over all I'm very satisfied, I'm also using this camera to do some special effects, green screen and so forth with some extra lighting which will be required.. I recommend this for those who are just starting, wanting a family and travel type camcorder and some regular shooting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, cost, video light, SD slot, and manual control.. 
Cons:. Low light quality and expensive battery.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features, good wide screen mode, accepts add-ons.. 
Cons:. needs more manual settings. 
Summary:. Here is a list of the motion picture cams I've owned since 1968: Kodak Brownie 8mm,. Chinon Super8 sound, Sanyo VM-D6 8mm video and now the Elura 100.(I'm not counting the Aiptek for obvious reasons). I have owned 10 times as many still cameras in the same time period.. The point is, I'm a lousy videographer.. So in looking for a camcorder, I needed one that I could justify the cost of yet still not come up short in the "I wish I could" department. The Elura 100 fits all of that.. Good color, sound and the picture quality is great too. But what makes it a "real" camera is the ability to accept filters, lenses and an external mic. It also will accept an external AV input making transfer of my old 8mm tapes or even copying from one DV to another.. Because it will shoot in true 16:9, I am convinced that is going to be my usual mode.. As we move further into the new century, 4:3 will become an "artsy" or "retro" format if it hasn't already.. It can carry an SD card and will take 1MP stills (not that great but possibly good for planning later scenes) and video in QVGA.. Now, in relation to that, one negative I noted is that some of the used Canons I saw on eBay had tape loading/transport problems. But I'm sure that is common to ANY camera with moving parts.. As others have mentioned, the controls are a bit tiny and touchy and I have to remember to look for sub-menus for some adjustments.. I'm used to manual adjustments on still cameras to be accessable right away... so it's just me.. The Elura 100 is quite compatable with my editing software ULead Video studio 10 and the best recommendation on that is to buy a firewire cable for it right away.. Aside from that, the worse problem I've had. is holding on to the thing. I'd love to find a pistol grip like the ones on the demo cameras at my local Costco (not where I got this cam BTW). Where did we ever get the idea that one hand is sufficent for a camcorder?. Conclusion:Good quality, flexibility and price. It's a Canon so I'm thinking it'll hold up for a while. My first digital still was a Canon and survived everything except 3rd row @ a Gallagher show.. Keep this one in mind and maybe get it on-line from a place you trust as store retail is a bit pricey in relation.. 

$$;
Pros:. great video quality, compact, analog to digital conversion, led light. 
Cons:. included software is no good, quality in low light could be better. 
Summary:. I thought I would have to spend over $1,000 to get video quality this good.Very close to television broadcast.Some people complain about motor noise: I have'nt heard any yet.I was wondering if a $315 camcorder would be good enough for me as I am a perfectionist; but I plan on keeping this one. You won't regret the elura 100. Buy it today!Plan on spending another $100 on assessories.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, playback quality,size,functionality. 
Cons:. No firewire cable provided,tiny light. 
Summary:. This camera is easy to use, very functional,. has many features. The menu-joystick is 'user friendly'. The playback quality of the video and sound is amazing. Not easy to use if you have large hands. Recommend attaching a neck strap to the wrist strap for walking around. The built-in lens cover is handy. The still-camera is also easy to use, but playback quality is low, this is only 1.3m pixels. Would not recommend as primary digital camera. Must buy the firewire cable for $25. Battery life is very good considering the size. The plastic. covers for the plugins are flimsy. I detected no motor noise as many reviews mention. You'll be happy with this camera if you pay less than $350. BUT, dont purchase from New Connections mail order online. They did a bait-switch on an accessory kit and do not respond to contacts.. 

$$;
Pros:. True widescreen, sharp images, very good low light performance for a single chip camera. 
Cons:. A little ergonomically challenged, no DV cable. 
Summary:. I spent hours reviewing video cameras prior to purchasing my Elura 100. My main goal was to find an affordable camera that delivered good quality, low light (in door) performance. My secondary goal was finding good battery life. This unit's standard battery has been compared to "extended" life batteries of other units, and has not run out on me yet when I've been filming.. So far my wife and I have been very pleased. I do think the unit is a bit difficult to handle. That is, once you have the unit strapped to your hand it can be tricky to access functions..

Pros:. Small size, decent zoom, very good video quality.. 
Cons:. LCD slightly dim in bright sunlight. Extendable eyepiece would have been nice (minor concern).. 
Summary:. Required a small and inexpensive (in case of breakage) video cam for downhill skiing. Fits the bill perfectly. Also wanted all of the outputs to attach a helmet cam - one of the few in this range to offer this option. Prefer it to Sony due to the Sony Touch Screen controls - a dubious touch in the out of doors where hands are not always clean. Overall - excellent for the money..

Pros:. provides fantastic outdoor video in sunlight/daytime. 
Cons:. so-so for indoor under lighting at night. 
Summary:. So I was looking for a cheap camcorder and I read the reviews of the Elura 100. It's great camera though I overpaid at Fry's $399. This is my 2nd camcorder I've owned (the previous a vintage Panasonic VHS-C from 1989 -- one of the first VHS-C camcorders from Panasonic -- a big beast; but durable - they built that thing like a tank -- I paid $1000 for that thing back then -- err my dad did).. I would say that the Elura 100 provides excellent performance outdoors and has many features for this price. The colors are accurate, and sharp outside. Just stick it on "Easy" and you are all set. There's excellent saturation too; nothing is washed out like some cameras and you don't need any polarizing filter - it was tested in Southern california sunshine -- but get a clear UV Haze filter to protect the lens (27mm).. For Indoors, to get the most optimum results you should adjust the white balance and exposure. What I do is "lie" to the camera and put the exposure on "Snow" which seems to boost the gain indoors and opens the aperture all the way - I don't know exactly why - but if you mess with the exposure settings you can increase the aperture more indoors. Also, with the white balance, for indoors I usually set it to Outdoor if there's natural light coming through the window; or Tungsten mode which has a "warmer" feel for the video footage.. The camera's exposure sensor gets a little confused if there's extreme bright light coming in and will close down the aperture a lot. You just gotta over-ride with manual aperture usually.. I normally rent a VX-2100 from Sony for Wedding production videos -- so I'm very familiar with video cameras -- the VX-2100 is the best benchmark to use; and that camera has amazing low-light performance without hardly any perceivable noise. You can definitely see what a tiny 1/5" CCD does to the performance.. But nontheless, this is a sub $400 camera and it's a bang for the buck.. If you do most of your shooting outside with your family/friends/drinking buddies, etc. on the beach, parks, etc. this camera won't dissapoint. If you do a *majority* of shooting indoors at night (there are some people who do this! when they have parties) -- you need to seriously look at cameras with a MUCH bigger sensor -- like 1/3" to get the BEST performance -- the Elura 100 is only so-so. Alternatively, you can purchase some bright lights and bounce them to make up for the small CCD of the Elura 100 if you want to shoot indoors at night.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good color, good digital effects, Very Good Overall. 
Cons:. Button placement is a bit awkward till you get uses to it. Low light recording not so great, but better than most in this range.. 
Summary:. After owning a Sony DCR-HC21 and being less than Happy, I did alot of research before buying this one.. The Elura 100 is a great choice. Slightly above entry level!!!. NO REGRETS ON THIS ONE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. If I needed to, I could carry it in my pocket.. 
Cons:. I just wish I could get the software that comes with the $9,000 camera (grin).. 
Summary:. It's been a very long time since I've used a camcorder. So this is very difficult to rate. I've got to force myself to remember that this is an economically priced entry level camera. Keeping this in mind, I will rate this camera higher than I would if I paid more for it. I paid $379 at BB for this guy. I wasn't going to buy any camcorder that didn't have a remote. When I shopped for camcorders that had remotes, I always ended up in the $600 range. Then I found this guy and it made me happy because it seemed to be exactly what I needed and much less expensive.. I do like this camera. I did have to purchase a Fire Wire cable and those guys aren't cheap. The Fire Wire cable is needed to download videos to a computer.. I really thought that I couldn't do without a 20X or higher optical zoom. I excluded a lot of camcorders just because they only had a 10X optical zoom or less. After using this camera for 3 weeks, I've learned that I could have settled for less optical zoom. I find that I rarely if ever want to use any zoom.. The first time I downloaded videos to my computer, Windows XP asked me if I wanted to use Windows Movie Maker. I chose yes and it seems to be a very decent program to use. Windows Movie Maker does many of the things I need to do. At first I let Movie Maker choose the bit rate that it thought was best. Then I learned that if I wanted the actual recording quality that the camera had produced I would need to choose the 25 Mb/sec rate. But at that rate the files are enormous. So my plan is to record everything, then preview using Movie Maker, find my favorite few seconds or minutes of video and capture them at the highest rate possible. After all, most of what I shoot is ultra-boring.. As far as shooting still photos, I don't really plan on using that feature. That is what I have a digital camera for. Nothing beats a digital camera for stunning digital photos. Every day, I pack my digital camera and my new Canon camcorder in my briefcase. It's a good combination.. If I had paid $600 for this camcorder I would give it a lower rating, but for this price range, I will rate it higher.. It's got a pretty good "bang for the buck" factor going for it.. Cheers,. Dave.

Pros:. Good pic quality, compact size, easy to use, nice features.. 
Cons:. Saw purple fringing in some bright scenes.. 
Summary:. This is one nice little camera.. The overall picture quality is quite. good. I did notice purple fringing. around some objects in bright scenes. but no big deal. I have been using it. outside only, havn't tried using it. inside just yet.. The size is great. I can slip this. into my coat pocket without much problem.. The controls are pretty well placed. and easy to learn. Features such as. analog-to-digital conversion is good. to have. I'll probably use it some days. to convert old tapes.. This camera has decent zoom (20x). I was. considering this and the ZR700 which is. about the same price. Went with the. Elura 100 due to better pic quality. from a review I read.. The ability to capture to SD card is nice. to have, although, serious picture takers. should get a real camera instead. 1MP. just doesn't cut it.. I like the true widescreen feature. This. is great for the newer tv sets. Battery. life is decent. Probably a good idea to. get an extra BP-208 (I think) for around. $45.. This little camcorder is an excellent. value for the money (paid $309 for it)..

Pros:. this camcorder takes great daytime video. 
Cons:. nightime or indoor shooting is very dark. 
Summary:. I bought this camcorder based on many reviews and hours of research. I finally found one at our local best buy as a clearance item. Daytime video is great with robust color definition. The problem arose when I tried to shoot indoors. The video was really dark as compared to 2 older sony camcorders used for testing. Another small problem was noticed with the Elura's auto focus. It was slower to focus &#38; would occasionally hunt more so than the other 2 sonys. If you plan on shooting only in bright light then this camera would be a good choice in this price range but if you are like me &#38; need to shoot indoors there are better choices. I really wanted to like this camcorder but unfortunately I need to shoot many of my children's "milestones" indoors. I could not rely on this camcorder for those once in a lifetime moments.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features, easy to use, good video in daylight. 
Cons:. Grainy picture in low light, whining sound of motor. 
Summary:. I would keep this camera,except for the less than stellar performance in low light conditions and the terribly annoying motor whine which pervades the audio recording. If you are at all sensitive to the sound quality, beware. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent picture for the price. 
Cons:. Motor noise WAY too noticeable. 
Summary:. Steer clear if audio matters to you. The motor causes a "whining" sound that is extremely audible in recordings taken with little background noise. I'm surprised that C-Net's review didn't mention that. Did thay make a recording with it? If audio doesn't matter to you then go for it. It had a pretty decent picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good video quality, light, microphone input. 
Cons:. VERY loud tape drive, external mic port useless because of distortion. 
Summary:. The video quality on this camera was great but all that was ruined by a VERY VERY loud tape drive. The sound coming from the MiniDV tape drive was so loud that it was picked up by both the built-in microphone AND an external microphone placed a good 5-6 inches from the unit. The distortion was so bad I returned the camera. Canon needs to address this issue as I have been reading about this a lot lately. Let the buyer beware with this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stellar video; excellent zoom; well-placed controls; easy to use; unbelievably low price for its features. 
Cons:. Motor noise is recorded on the tape - intolerable. 
Summary:. I can't tell you how disappointed I am with the motor noise problem which afflicts this camera. I bought it for a superb price ($306) from Amazon.com, along with a Sony HDR-HC3 ($1,150) high-definition camcorder. My intent was to compare the cameras side-by-side in identical shooting situations, to see how they compared with each other.. Both cameras were put through their paces in several hours of both indoor and outdoor recording. The outdoor footage included sunny and cloudy days, high noon and twilight, and recordings of my grandchildren sledding after a 15-inch snowfall. The Elura 100 astounded me with the quality of its video in all of these situations. In some footage it was actually superior to the high-definition Sony on playback (though I didn't use an HDMI cable to play the Sony footage back through my high-definition TV). Now for the disappointing news . . .. With a houseful of family (four generations' worth) at Thanksgiving, I demonstrated both cameras' output for my relatives and everybody was impressed with both cameras' video performance. However, everybody in the room (18 people, literally) asked what the high-pitched whine was when I played the Elura 100 through my TV. Most likened it to the sound of a machine shop operating at full bore (though much quieter, obviously). The whine was very audible (and very annoying) in all footage, even recordings of people's conversations. The unanimous verdict of my relatives was that none of them would even consider keeping a camera which tainted its video recordings with such an obnoxious sound.. Thinking (and hoping) that the noise was somehow being communicated by the camera itself during the playback function, I played the Canon-recorded tape on TV using the Sony HDR-HC3 as the playback engine, but the same intolerable whine came through the TV loud and clear.. I also played the tape of the same activities which was recorded with the Sony videocam. The Sony-recorded tape was played through my TV with both the Sony videocam and the Elura 100 as the playback machine. The result? No background whine, hum or other noise whatsoever! The problem therefore lies in the recording mechanism/process of the Elura 100 itself.. Alas! I've fallen in love with the size, weight, user-friendliness, features and video output of the Canon Elura 100, but even if the camera cost nothing, I can't justify or overlook the annoying sound which would hereafter accompany priceless recordings of the most important people in my life (if I were to continue to use the Elura 100). Since others have commented about the same problem, I'm not optimistic that an exchange for another Elura 100 will solve the problem. So, the Elura 100 is going back to Amazon.com.. But for the deal-killing whine in my recordings, I would rate this camera a "10".. 

$$;
Pros:. Surprise, its a really great camera all around except for.... 
Cons:. MOTOR NOISE!. 
Summary:. I read all the reviews. Kept reading about camera noise, so I had to check out for myself. My cousin has this camera, and he permitted me to use it at several of my childrens events. Initially, I had no problems. At a birthday party and a karate tournament, it performed flawlessly. However, when I tried to tape my daughters piano recital, or coax a few words out of a friends baby, the motor noise was very blatant. In situations where there is alot of noise to drown out the motor, such as parties and sporting events, its fine. But if you do an interview, or if you tape a piano recital or such where there is not much other background noise, the motor will be heard clearly. I decided to move on to another camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent clarity. 
Cons:. Loud motor noise. 
Summary:. I bought this camera using the recommendations from cnet. I was very disappointed because of the motor noise. It was so loud that it got in to the recording. This noise was very distinct.I would surely recommend a sony DCR HC36/DCR HC46 instead of this one.

Pros:. Started Out Great, Then Phhffft!. 
Cons:. Remove the Cassette Error Message -- Even When There's No Cassette In It!. 
Summary:. The performance of my camera started out great, but then continuously deteriorated to the point where I can barely use it any more, all due to the infamous "Remove the Casette" error message that constantly occurs. I've done all the removing the battery, and going from vcr to record, then twirling around the room three times, yada, yada, but it's just too much work for such an unreliable result and product.. I see there are countless others with this problem, mostly the 50 and 80 models. Any other 100 owners have this problem? It's obviously a design defect that Canon is well aware of, yet is doing nothing about. I can't tell you all the frustration and grief this has caused.. If I could, I'd just like my money back, no class action suit or anything like that. But if pushed, I have no choice but to fight for what's right. It's a shame Canon would put out a product like this, knowing full well they have a design problem, especially when they carry it over from one model to the next.. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to get a refund?. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, too cheap, easy to hold. 
Cons:. Very bad image quality. 
Summary:. I have to say that this camera is about 10 years behind, it has a 0.88 Megapixel CCD, which means my 10 year old Panasonic Digital camera at 1MP had a better resolution. Although it did fairly well (for the resolution ) in low light, simply it was a waste of time filming anything since I would not be able to sit and watch it on ANYTHING except the 2" LCD screen..
