replaced an upconvert dvd player after it broke down  .

bought primarily for the streaming , but overall it is a great unit  .

as this is my first insignia product , i am impressed  .

do want  .

for free  .

great player  .

i love it .

great player for price .

i purchased this with the purpose of moving my media center pc to my office to replace an old computer there  .

once i realized that i couldn't stream my network music , i began to wonder whether this is a good purchase  .

after seeing how seamlessly everthing else worked , and i found out i is able to play music files from a usb drive , it looks much better and does not have the quirks that my media center has when playing blu    rays or dvd's  .

netflix streaming is at a much higher quality than my media center  .

fyi , the media center is windows 7 quad core machine with 6gb ram and is clean of spyware and viruses  .

i just cannot take this back at this point even though i use the ability to play all of the music files from one directory using winamp's great visualizations .

some folks have trouble connecting wireless  .

a good signal form your router is one of the main things to check  .

a good strong signal should take some of the headaches out of your life .

if you can find this on sale get it  .

even if you end up paying the original price , your are getting a lot of features and a very very nice picture .

just bought one for hubby hope he likes it .

great features for the price  .

i think everyone should try one  .

i hope i will get one soon  .

i dont know who makes this for best buy , but disregarding the slow and noisy loading , and weak remote , all in all it's ok  .

the best part is it's one of the lower priced players with wi    fi built in .

great player , i bought this on sale for 129  .

00 , i have been loving it ever since , the picture quality is better than a samsung blu ray player that i own  .

makes me wonder what i is watching before cause this is awesome picture , netflix works great .

overall a solid product from insignia with netflix capabilities .

so far , it's a solid unit that did not break the bank  .

love the netflix streaming .

i am looking into buying a blue    ray player , specifically one with built    in wifi and netflix readiness  .

i am between the lg , sony n460 (which would require an external ethernet bridge , since wifi is not built in) and this one  .

however , the price difference makes me wonder if i can trust the quality of this one  .

does anyone have the insignia ns    wbrdvd , and if so , could you comment on the level of user    friendliness of its interface for netflix and other online video streaming  .

thank you also , i would like to be submitted for the contest to win one .

not a bad player considering that i got it on clearance .

great value and much better unit than i expected  .

replaced oppo upscaling dvd player and am happy i did  .

everything works and at a price that makes sense  .

just remember this   if the movie is terrible before blu    ray , it still is and 1080p wo not change anything .

i dare you to buy a new blu    ray that does more for less money  .

good luck  .

just buy it and enjoy .

if you do not want to spend a lot of maney , go for it .

well this sure would be a nice late christmas present good luck all   )  .

good luck me  .

i bought this unit mainly for its netflix streaming and wireless capabilities  .

the video streaming quality is very good  .

configuring the wireless settings took about 10 minutes and another 5 to update the firmware  .

i purchased on sale from bb for $149  .

the blu ray video quality is good  .

the remote control for this unit is really bad and has a cheap look to it  .

the signal strength is poor and the buttons tend to stick  .

i is able to setup this unit with my logitech harmony one universal remote and it works flawlessly  .

so , all and all a good unit for budget minded people .

looking forwarding to trying this product  .

i just found out that insignia made a blueray player with features such as ethernet and wifi ethernet plus usb on a blueray player forunder $200  .

what a deal  .

if i can get one i will write an honest review keith  .

i probably would not buy one  .

but , for free , it's for me .

i started my blu    ray search when netflix came to these units  .

i started with the samsung 3600 but returned it a week later because it just seemed very primitive compared to my sony dvd players i've used for years  .

in disk mode , there is no stop/resume memory , and no frame by frame shuttle in reverse  .

two functions i use all the time  .

but the samsung did have some features that the insignia unit is missing after trying both out  .

on the samsung , when in netflix mode , i liked how you could see the quality meter change depending how strong of a signal is being received wirelessly at the time  .

the insignia doesn't let you know if there  .

s a signal problem  .

with the samsung , sometimes opening a door in my room cleared a path for better quality video  .

the insignia also doesn't include a universal remote and my mitsubishi 57734 doesn't recognize this unit either  .

so i  .

m remote juggling between volume and play  .

the samsung is recognized right away by my mitsubishi remote and vice versa via hdmi  .

no extra remote programming needed  .

on both units , on all 3 of the same blu    ray's i  .

ve watched , they don  .

t resume when you stop the disk  .

it starts up from scratch every time , from load to previews to disk menu to beginning of movie  .

not sure if that  .

s normal  .

i thought only some disks do not resuem after stop as far as the netflix streaming quality , i  .

d say it  .

s like a non    hd cable channel , only fit to the full , not stretched , 16  9 screen  .

i have no complaints there , after all it is streaming so i thought i is only trading down in price , but i is trading down quite a few very usable features as well  .

m going to return this one next , and i'm going to try the ps3 , though not a gamer , and see if maybe it has any better features  .

i heard ps3  .

s are more user friendly and now that it offers netflix , seems like a logical choice since i enjoyed sony players so much before  .

if i don  .

t like the ps3 , i might then try the lg  .

and if that one still doesn  .

t cut it , as of now , i  .

d most likely go back to the samsung .

if i continue to have problems with the remote i will likely take this unit back  .

i is unable to program a universal remote to see if i could circumvent this problem  .

the streaming feature is consistent and offers excellent picture quality  .

i liked the controls for blu    ray/dvd , however the unit is noisy until the movie starts  .

could not get bd live to work yet , though the unit is connected to the internet  .

disappointing that netflix is the only online service updated  .

on feb 27 , 2010  .

price seems decent , but may still opt for ps3 , simply for quality and versatility go cnet  .

bottom line , if you just want a blu ray player that can play blu ray and dvds and stream pandora and netflix this is the one for you  .

if you want to use wifi call your internet provider and make sure that your router is compatible with the player  .

if you want to use the bd live feature that is on most blu rays that i own then dont get this player  .

if you are reading theis review and can tell me how to use it let me know  .

i keep getting asked to make sure that i am connected to the internet when i try even though i just used netflix  .

go figure buy at your own risk  .

luckily i got mine as a christmas present so i did not waste the money .

this could have been the been the absolute best valued dvd player out there for the price with having built    in wi    fi support , except for one seemingly minor but fatal flaw  .

i cannot necessarily recommend agains this player , but you should definitely know what to expect of this flaw before you buy it  .

some may be able to live with the flaw , and if you can , then it's an otherwise excellent blu    ray player  .

i can not and have returned this player becuase of it  .

it's such a good deal otherwise i really hated to but i just couldn't live with the flaw  .

first the positive  .

this is the best priced blu    ray player out there with built    in wi    fi , period  .

it's regular price is $179  .

i got it on sale for $149  .

every other blu    ray player i've seen with built    in wi    fi costs $229 or higher  .

at $149 on sale this thing is a steal  .

even at the regular price of $179 it's a heck of a deal  .

picture quality is great  .

never tried the netflix streaming (i'm not a netflix user) but other user reviews have said it worked well  .

the wi    fi is very easy to set up (i don't understand other reviews that say they've had trouble setting up the wi    fi , i can only guess they have problems with their wi    fi network in general)  .

plug a 4 gb usb drive , which can be had for about $12 on sale these days , in the back and you're all set for bd    live  .

okay , now for the bad part , the flaw  .

the unit's response to the remote control is horrible  .

i had to point the remote directly at the player to get any response at all and even then i often had to press buttons 2 or 3 times before it responed  .

if you have a universal remote you can program it may work better  .

i have a high end philips prontopro ng remote  .

i programmed the pronto to control the dvd player and with regular infrared it works fine  .

but i also have an rf (radio frequency) adapter for my pronto remote and using that , it didn't work  .

i had to ge the rf receiver (the device that receives the rf and converts it back to infrared) about 10 ft from the front of the player before it would work  .

well , my room is about 15 feet long and i normally have the rf receiver at the back of the room and it doesn't work from that distance  .

but if you use just plain infrared with a high quality universal remote , it will probably be fine  .

i'm not willing to live without the universal remote and radio frequency adapter capability  .

the remote control is my only complaint about this device though  .

if it were not for the remote problems , i would have given this device a full 5 stars  .

it's such a shame that an otherwise fantastic device , especially for its price , is shackled by what you'd think should be the least of your worries in how well the remote control responds updated  .

on feb 7 , 2010  .

not worth it for any price  .

tech support just tells me to upgrade my wireless access port even though my wireless works with all 5 of my pcs and my wii  .

but it wont work with insignia junk  .

save your money and buy a name    brand product .
