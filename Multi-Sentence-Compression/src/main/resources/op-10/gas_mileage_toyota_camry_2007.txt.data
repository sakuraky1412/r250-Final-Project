Mileage a little disappointing .
This new one gets even better mileage, averages about 33 freeway .
Mileage is mediocre at an average of 25 .
The Mileage Queen has put 55,000 miles on  Ricky  since Sept 06   .
Good gas mileage, comfortable seating, lots of leg room .
It gets great mileage, and runs great .
Powerfull, quiet, good gas mileage, excellent workmanship, good audio system .
Good acceleration for engine size, and good mileage, especially when highway cruising around 70 mph   .
Highway mileage already greater than promised .
My previous BMW 3 series got better mileage, and believe me it was more fun to drive .
