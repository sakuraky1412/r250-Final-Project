greatest point    and    shoot camera  .

i searched everywhere for a camera that i wanted and i fell apon this one and i loved everything i is hearing about it , the main reviews that were bad is about the battery life , and i agree with that  .

if you have children or pets this camera is great  .

its good for all events if you want a picture taken right away  .

also it works great in the dark and light  .

this is the best best best little camera  .

i would recommend it to anyone  .

i bought mine refurbished and i still dont have any complaints  .

this is a great point and shoot camera  .

in full auto mode the sd790is takes outstanding images for the price what i is looking for in a digital camera    .

ease of use , sub 200 dollar price , and fantastic picture quality why    .

my last camera is a nikon coolpix 5700 , which captures great images in the right conditions (imho) , but is intimidating to many people due to the less than intuitive layout/design/controls for non    slr users  .

my significant other is intimidated by this camera and as a result i end up on the other side of the lens all the time and rarely appear in pictures with my family what i got in the sd790is    .

the cannon sd790is very easy to operate in auto mode  .

the price is right and the images are , imho , amazing for this price range  .

it destroyed the comparable nikons beyond meeting all my initial criteria , the sd790is has outstanding video and i have not experienced any problems with the placement of the microphone pinhole and wind noise , as suggested by the cnet review  .

the color accent feature is also interesting to play with battery life is significant , though i purchased an additional battery for reserve when traveling out of country  .

double aa battery cameras are great for this purpose , but the battery life of the sd790is makes this a non    issue , at least for my purposes the display is big and beautiful , though i sometimes feel it is too forgiving with questionable images i thoroughly recommend this camera if it fits your needs .

i'm a point and shot kind of guy  .

i've used everything from high slr to these little compact types  .

this is the easiest to use , takes a great photo , and meets my needs very well  .

i'd recommend this to anyone .

i have always been a big fan of the canon powershot series  .

the sd790is is another great canon camera in my opinion  .

so far all the pictures have turned out great  .

camera seems like it is built/constructed very well  .

very east to use controls  .

button layout is a nice change in my opinion  .

highly recommended  .

bought this camera hours before going to nyc and found it very easy to use and it took great pictures  .

we currently own to sonys and after becoming frustrated with por pictures we decided to give canon a chance  .

so far so good and for $179 at costco a great deal .

i've been researching digital camera's for quite some time but couldn't quite make up my mind  .

but then my photographer buddy showed me what he uses when he is not using pro cameras (like when he's on vacation)  .

he had a sd750 and he loved the thing which brought me over to the canon's i actually bought the sd790 thinking it is the 750 when i got it from costco  .

btw if you want a great price for these go to your local costco  .

i couldn't be happier with the purchase the prices of sd cards are so cheap , just don't even think of having the pathetic 32mb as a con  .

buy yourself whatever card size you think you need and be happy with the awesome quality of this camera  .

you wo not regret it .

approx 1500 to 2200 photos per canon so far    all loving family shots from across the country  .

thanks canon for making my family happy and able to share our family photos again  .

i'll be purchasing another 5 over the next couple of months  .

thanks cnet for your accurate reviews and shopping assistance  .

ps    not a griper but sent nikon 4 cameras withy the same failure , battery door tabs broken , and they said not their problem  .

perhaps nikon planned their name to anagram nikon  no kin  .

a really great camera  .

just returned from 2 weeks in seattle/alaska  .

i am so pleased with the pictures    clear , balanced , no shake all the things i need as an amateur photographer and parent on the move highly recommend  .

i upgraded from the sd550 canon there is not comparisent  .

the sd790is far surpasses the sd550  .

i am very happy with my new sd790 .

like this product due to unmatchable canon photo quality  .

i bought this camera a couple months ago , and it has been really awesome  .

the pictures it takes are fantastic , and they have great quality  .

i love the angular look of the camera , and the video is amazing (the mic faces backwards , yet still gets all the sound  .

how is that possible  .

the big screen size is fantastic and doesn't seem to take a big hit off battery life  .

i have brightness maxed and rarely use flash , and get about 500+ shots per charge  .

as a little side    note   the picture files are pretty large (i shoot at the max quality) , so i invested in an 8 gb sdhc card and get 1745 pictures before purging if you are wondering about the screen thing , i have put this camera through thick and thin (left in overnight in a 10    below 0 degrees f garage , dropped (in a small case) , and it has been hit (through a 1/2 inch of neoprene not much protection there) , and i noticed some blue spots on my screen (not like dead pixels , but splotches)  .

i brought it to best buy and the geek squad said it looked like moisture , but needless to say they sent it out to be repaired , free of charge (even though i bought the camera like 6 months ago)  .

decent service  .

as for the scroll wheel , it also clicks in the four directions  .

it can be a little oversensitive but that is probably because i do not use the scroll wheel often vs  .

just pressing down in the four quadrants so overall , this camera is fantastic  .

enjoy  .

updated  .

on jun 5 , 2009  .

i just bought this camera and have been playing with it a few weeks now  .

i got is because it is soooooo cheep right now and cnet's great review of it so far , i have not done anything serious with it yet but just take some pics of me and my friends during our music program and do some youtube videos  .

it is great  .

i love almost every aspect of it  .

but video quality just kills it (note that if you want a camera for mainly video recording , you should not even think about this camera and is not a video camera)  .

when i record myself playing piano , it has a weird sound with it but normal recording is fine i'm about to go to europe and cannot wait to use this fully and take great pictures of landscape and castles best camera for price , usability , and picture quality  .

i am really happy with the operation of the camera  .

i am a point and shoot photographer and this fits the bill without hurting your pocket book  .

i would definitely recommend this camera to my friends .

i spent a lot of top shopping for cameras in the $200 range  .

i spent a lot of time reading reviews on multiple cameras and narrowed down the field to the sd790 is , sd 1100 is , and a fujifilm finepix 1000fd  .

i finally had to go to an electronics store to test them all out for myself the fuji is nice , but unimpressive  .

after an hour of going back and forth between the 790 and the 1100 , i chose the 790 for its much larger screen size (something that i have never really cared about)  .

the image just looks so much clearer on the large screen i've been testing it for about a month now and i have been extremely impressed  .

i took it tunneling through a steam heating system and it came out on the other side fine , not to mention the pictures that it took in the dark were perfect i like the wide variety of fun features    i enjoy playing with them when bored my biggest complaint is the slow performance time when waiting for the flash to recharge  .

however , this seems to be the case with all point    and    shoot digitals in this price range overall , it's a fantastic camera  .

i already have a few friends that have seen it and have since added it to their christmas lists  .

i recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable digital camera  .

it's the best bang    for    your    buck you'll get in this price range .

this is my 5th digital camera  .

i have a canon slr but not easy to carry around , esp  .

to catch outdoor pictures for kids  .

so i is looking for a easy point and shot camera  .

i did a careful reviewed and tested a few cameras , finally bought this one  .

i am very happy with my choice .

forget megapixels and go for a camera w/ the features you need  .

all of these cameras have enough megapixels to print even big prints , and they all have tiny lenses that are incapable of performance beyond a certain point anyhow  .

i like this camera b/c of the big screen on the back and because it takes ok indoor pictures .

great camera  .

i carry it in my pocket all the time  .

its fast and the battery life is awesome  .

i took over 600 pictures in 2 days and only had to recharge once .

i choose this little camera because it is an ultra compact that is really easy to carry and to use , you can ask anyone to take a picture with excellent and consistent results  .

i loved the sd750 but i felt that the image stabilizer is missing the sd790is is an all    metal (at least on the outside) camera  .

the 3 lcd is huge and superb for composing photos  .

i do not miss the optical viewfinder and i prefer to have this excellent screen than having a smaller 2  .

5 display with a tiny optical viewfinder i would like a manual mode , but the fully automatic exposure is pretty good as well as auto    focus  .

the face recognition is also both handy and accurate i feel the 3x zoom somewhat limited  .

the camera is noisy from iso 200 and above (but it is not worst than any other competing ultra    compact camera) and yet the iso 400 and even iso 800 is good for smaller prints  .

at iso 80 the resultas are very pleasant this little camera is more on the luxury look , feel and price , yet i think that the price is fair and the value for money is good all in all i am very happy with this camera and i take it with me all the time .

this is the epitome of the elph class cameras  .

after owning this for some months itï¿½ s my thought it does everything that is advertised  .

remember this is only an ultra compact and not a full fledge take up a lot or room camera  .

itï¿½ s perfect for traveling  .

at first the click wheel seemed a little awkward but after a couple of weeks the click wheel loosened up a little and it became a pleasure to use , i also like the razor buttons , (very stream line  .

the picture quality is very good , and with the on board cropping , well thatï¿½ s just plain neat  .

10 mega pixels , durable , itï¿½ s a good choice  .

all the elphs are good cameras but i chose this one  .

the 3in screen sold me  .

in short , fantastic photos , well built , good looking , and fun to use .

this is my second elph , the first one is purchased over 8 years ago , and the darn thing is still working  .

it is a 2 mega pixel  .

after this i bought a nikon and a casio  .

now , a few weeks ago i decided to buy the canon ï¿½ssd 790 isï¿½ï¿½ and wow , these cameras have come a long way  .

after weeks of experimenting with the different settings , indoor and outside , this has to be the slickest elph made so far  .

once you get used to the click wheel , your off and running  .

it encourages you to use all the functions , and its fun also  .

the pictures are crystal clear and not at all soft  .

the start up time is amazingly quick ; push the power button and itï¿½ s ready (really fast)  .

put this beside one of the older elph cameras and the sd 790 is quite a bit smaller  .

but it still retains the same quality stainless steel , held together with tiny screws , just like the original  .

and lastly the 3inch lcd display is bright and clear , together with the flush mounted buttons this is what the elph should be  .

small , well built , and durable .

not going to get into all the technical nitty    gritty i'll leave that for other reviewers overall , i did a ton of research from the time of the 2008 ces show in vegas  .

i is looking for something to replace my aging canon sd500  .

since that is a great camera overall , i had high expectations the contenders i narrowed it down to were basically the canon sd790is , canon sd890is , canon sd1100is , panasonic dmc    fx35 , olympus 1030sw and the fuji finepix f100fd each camera had its pluses and minuses  .

after testing each camera out at the store , i ended up feeling the canon sd790is had the best blend of features overall  .

in addition to this , the 3 screen is far    and    away the most vivid clear of the bunch  .

also , the excellent canon menu system combined with the jog dial and recessed razr    like buttons provided the greatest ease of use in my opinion  .

i actually really wanted to like the olympus 1030sw but the clumsy menu system and mandatory use of xd cards caused me to eliminate it as a contender now that i've used the camera on a few occasions , i am really impressed so far  .

the startup time is lightning fast  .

shot    to    shot cycle times are very fast  .

and there is also virtually no shutter lag which is a big difference compared to my old sd500  .

the face detection technology with the digic iii processor is amazing  .

little floating rectangular boxes on the screen always are able to locate each person's face and focus in on them  .

it however does not work for pets from my testing  .

pictures in various lighting conditions (indoor/outdoor) have been awesome so far  .

we were in a dimly lit club and the pics we took came out perfectly  .

my old sd500 would have overexposed and bleached out everybody's faces  .

though it is not capable of hd video , movie mode is still very good  .

paired with a 16gb sdhc card , you can really take some long movies if needed  .

other pluses include the truly awesome screen  .

it's so crisp and large that i really do not care about the missing optical viewfinder  .

it's also great for using it as a photo album with friends family  .

one really cool feature is that the screen has a tilt sensor much like an iphone and will automatically tilt the picture for best viewing whether you are holding the camera horizontally or vertically minor gripes are that i wish it is slightly more compact like some of the casio exilims out there  .

the inclusion of features like hd video (like the panasonic dmc    fx35) and being waterproof and shockproof (like the olympus 1030sw) would have made this my dream camera but c'est la vie this already is pretty darn good overall  .

really the best compact shooter as of april 2008 .

canon has hit a home run for me with the (as of yet pending) release of the canon sd790 is  .

my wife and purchased the sd 750 last year and it has worked very well  .

i spent some time recently underway on an aircraft carrier and wanted something portable to take with me and chose the sony t2  .

despite it's styling the camera (as submitted by editors and reviewers here) had a less    than    stellar interface and took soft photos enter the brand    new canon sd790 is  .

despite it's late march availability i is able to purchase one online from circuitcity  .

com  .

(only store that shows it as stocked and available pending the actual release date  .

if you're looking for this camera , they likely have it in your area and you can purchase it       though only online with in store pickup or delivery) the camera has yet to be officially released , so even though i had purchased online the store manager would not let me look at a box in the display case since it is not yet available  .

(talk about a lack of common sense on the store's part  .

the packaging and included accessories are what you've come to expect if you've owned a canon point and shoot in the past  .

only downside is manufacturer's reluctance to include a memory card of any relevance    a 32 mb card is a waste of space  .

are they trying to clear long    held inventory  .

with the price of a new extreme iii sandisk sd card around $39 , a 1gb should be the new standard though i'm sure there is some sort of collusion with the memory card manufacturers the camera , thankfully , operates in a very similar fashion to the sd750  .

notable additions are the extremely nice (and glossy) 3  .

0    inch 4  3 display  .

comparing both cameras side by side did not prove the colors to be any better , but it certainly looks nice the way it's integrated into the camera  .

the controls are similar as well , though now there is a dial that actually spins (albeit not well when brand    new) to toggle through menu or shooting options  .

at first glance the sd790 looked larger physically than the 750 , but it's simply an illusion because of the single color design of the case (the black/silver combination of the 750 is quite slimming)  .

other than a style upgrade to the buttons , is operates largely the same taking pictures at the highest resolution setting provided excellent quality (10m/superfine/autofocus)  .

photos from both the 790 and 750 were uploaded into iphoto on a 17 glossy screen macbook pro for comparative purposes  .

the 790 shots were extremely crisp and showed few artifacts  .

the added is (image stabilization) definitely helped in low light situations , where the 750 would occasionally inject a slight blur due to camera shake with an extremely solid build quality , the same retail price as the returned sony t2 (which is 8  .

1mp btw) , and above average feature set the canon sd790 has already proven to be an excellent choice  .

looking forward to taking it overseas for a more in depth review .

overall this camera is a great buy if picture quality is your greatest selling point  .

i would recomend it to others for its price and quality  .

i am not crazy about the silver color though , it is dull and boring , i wish they made a red , blue or green model beacuse style is often overlooked as a quality feature  .

all in all a very good camera , my barrett jackson car auction pics were outstanding .

solid construction  .

feels heavy in a good way  .

camera may be a bit large for some people  .

stylish camera  .

flat buttons make camera more appealing but is somewhat unpractical  .

sacrifying practicality for looks  .

worth it in this case though compared to the sd1100  .

this camera is slight larger and heavier than the sd1100  .

i prefer the weight of the sd790  .

the shutter button is smaller on the sd1100  .

there is a larger selection of scene modes on the sd790  .

screen is larger on the sd790  .

i haven't compared the image quality on these cameras , but i'm sure theyre more or less similar  .

they both use the digic iii processor  .

the megapixel difference is virtually negligible for me since i don't print extremely large pics  .

i own both the sd1100 and the sd790 and would recommend the latter overall for ease of use and screen size  .

i would recommend the sd1100 for people who want a simple point and shoot than compact and do not need any advanced functions that the sd790 has  .

check these cameras out in person .

overall this is a great camera  .

i compared this camera with three others and found that the picture quality is my primary concern  .

i like the large lcd and never used the view finder on my previous canon cameras  .

i would like a better zoom and movie zoom in a similar size camera but the technology is not here yet  .

the camera feel solid and is easy to use since most of the functions are similar to previous canons .

i just go the camera about a week ago , and i love it  .

i've been waiting to actually see some footage of it and i saw a great video of the device over on tiger  .

tv , and it is just super gorgeous  .

the picture quality is phenomenal with its 10 megapixels as well as being a canon  .

the 3x zoom could be a little bigger (5x maybe) , but is fine  .

the new scroll wheel navigations is a little tough to get used to , but gets easier over time  .

the curves on the camera are beautiful and everything about it screams great camera  .

you can find it on the web for less than the $349 price tag , i got it for $315 on amazon and they had a discount on a 4gb memory card to bring the card to only $10  .

overall , buy this camera    you'll love it  .

canon just never disappoints  .

http  //blargkaboom  .

com  .

nice clean design that shoot great photos  .

playback button should be switched with print button and wheel should have a disconnect feature .

i have a two    year    old powershot a700 , with 6 megapixels , 6x zoom , an optical viewfinder , and it runs on standard aa batteries ; it can also zoom in movie mode  .

(alas , no image stabilization  .

) i do not see any of these features in the 790 is  .

i would love to upgrade to get is , but most definitely not at the expense of all these essentials canon has definitely blown it on this model  .

i'll upgrade as soon as one of the compact digital manufacturers stops futzing around with gimmicky features and gets serious about the basic feature set .

do not buy this camera  .

i am just one of many people who have had the lens functionality fail them in a 9 month period  .

it takes great photos and video but beware    it will stop working on you and without reason  .

it is fine one minute and then totally useless the next .

i'm frustated removing red eye , i'm taking it back and trying out a nikon  .

people tell me that it's common to have red eye with digital cameras , but this is too much .

do not waste your money , for about $50 less you can get a better camera .

i bought this camera based on the reviews here  .

i returned it only after a few hours after seeing the pictures at full quality on my pc  .

there is a significant amount of barrel effect along with blurred corners on all pictures  .

this the worst quality of pictures of any camera i've seen  .

i had to research again , this time with more objective websites with reviews of corner sharpness , iso and lens quality and low and behold , this camera is rated as the worst on corner sharpness  .

i also found out that the whole line up of these powershot cameras suffer from the same effects , barrel effect and very poor corner sharpness  .

after seeing many reviews of similar products in the same price range i found the panasonic lumix dmc    fs20 $10  .

00 cheaper and it takes perfect pictures  .

amazing clarity  .

enough said .
