i travel to dubai each year on business and decided to return to the towers rotana having taken a break for the last few years .
last time i visited the service was exceptionally good , but this time i observed some cracks starting to creep in .
check in was good , ( i had the exec level check in and lounge access ) but the service in the lounge throughout the week was patchy , i think largely down to the staff having language issues .
at this sort of hotel i expect a very good understanding of english in order to serve the international travelling community .
breakfast in the lounge was also just about ok , down on my previous experience and definitely not as good as similar hotels in the area .
the rooms are fine , but again losing their edge as bathroom components are missing in places .
water pressure was also poor , particularly for generating a good flow for the shower .
the traffic noise from sheikh zayed road could also be better insulated .
there was a constant , 24 hour hum noticeable in the room .
check out was disappointingly slow and unfriendly .
i think management could invest in some staff training to bring the finesse back to the service levels i remember from a few years ago , and some rooms could do with a refit to entice me to return in the future .
longs bar is not the most pleasant environment to have a drink , but . . .
