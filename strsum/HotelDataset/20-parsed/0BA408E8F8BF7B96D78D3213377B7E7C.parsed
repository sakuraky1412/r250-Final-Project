there/EX are/VBP fabulous/JJ reception/NN rooms/NNS on/IN the/DT ground/NN floor/NN ,/, sadly/RB with/IN no/DT view/NN as/IN a/DT horrible/JJ modern/JJ function/NN building/NN has/VBZ been/VBN erected/VBN directly/RB below/IN and/CC in/IN front/NN of/IN the/DT main/JJ building/NN ./.

we/PRP ate/VBD lunch/NN by/IN the/DT pool/NN which/WDT was/VBD good/JJ and/CC our/PRP$ evening/NN meal/NN ,/, served/VBD in/IN a/DT lovely/JJ medieval/JJ dining/NN hall/NN ,/, was/VBD first/JJ class/NN with/IN excellent/JJ service/NN provided/VBN by/IN mary/NN and/CC her/PRP$ husband/NN ./.

also/RB ,/, the/DT a/c/NN unit/NN was/VBD sited/VBN behind/IN the/DT heavy/JJ full-length/JJ curtains/NNS which/WDT meant/VBD that/IN the/DT only/JJ way/NN we/PRP could/MD cool/VB the/DT bedroom/NN at/IN night/NN was/VBD to/TO hitch/NN them/PRP up/RP on/IN the/DT windowsill/NN and/CC hope/NN they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB fall/VB down/RB ./.

apparently/RB the/DT information/NN is/VBZ being/VBG reprinted/VBN but/CC it/PRP would/MD have/VB been/VBN lovely/JJ if/IN a/DT member/NN of/IN staff/NN could/MD have/VB given/VBN us/PRP a/DT guided/VBN tour/NN as/IN i/FW am/VBP sure/JJ most/JJS people/NNS are/VBP attracted/VBN by/IN the/DT history/NN ./.

similarly/RB ,/, the/DT bathroom/NN had/VBD lovely/JJ antique/JJ fittings/NNS but/CC this/DT meant/VBD that/IN the/DT over-bath/JJ shower/NN was/VBD useless/JJ and/CC water/NN poured/VBD under/IN the/DT glass/NN screen/NN so/IN the/DT floor/NN flooded/VBD ./.

there/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD socket/NN in/IN the/DT room/NN -/: really/RB insufficient/JJ for/IN two/CD people/NNS with/IN phones/NNS and/CC ipads/NNS ,/, and/CC there/EX was/VBD no/DT full/JJ length/NN mirror/NN ./.

the/DT rooms/NNS are/VBP beautiful/JJ and/CC look/VB totally/RB authentic/JJ but/CC as/IN clearly/RB the/DT whole/JJ hotel/NN has/VBZ been/VBN renovated/VBN ,/, they/PRP really/RB have/VBP missed/VBN some/DT obvious/JJ improvements/NNS ./.

they/PRP kindly/RB put/VBD me/PRP in/IN a/DT lovely/JJ room/NN on/IN the/DT ground/NN floor/NN -110/CD -/: but/CC the/DT bathroom/NN was/VBD still/RB up/RB three/CD steep/JJ steps/NNS ./.

dinner/NN was/VBD served/VBN in/IN a/DT lovely/JJ room/NN at/IN the/DT other/JJ end/NN of/IN the/DT castle/NN but/CC we/PRP waited/VBD 1/CD hour/NN 10/CD mins/NNS for/IN our/PRP$ starter/JJ ./.

when/WRB i/FW requested/VBD an/DT alternative/JJ room/NN ,/, that/IN one/CD had/VBD similar/JJ steps/NNS up/IN to/TO the/DT wardrobes/NNS and/CC shower/NN ./.

it/PRP features/VBZ wonderful/JJ original/JJ features/NNS ,/, wall/NN paintings/NNS and/CC antique/JJ furnishings/NNS and/CC is/VBZ clearly/RB the/DT result/NN of/IN a/DT very/RB sympathetic/JJ restoration/NN ./.

there/EX are/VBP also/RB steps/NNS down/IN to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC 107/CD steps/NNS to/TO the/DT lovely/JJ swimming/NN pool/NN -LRB-/-LRB- although/IN a/DT golf/NN buggy/NN can/MD transport/VB you/PRP down/RP -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

on/IN the/DT plus/JJ side/NN ,/, breakfasts/NNS were/VBD excellent/JJ and/CC served/VBD on/IN the/DT tree-shaded/JJ terrace/NN with/IN a/DT view/NN over/IN the/DT valley/NN ./.

i/LS really/RB wanted/VBD to/TO learn/VB all/DT about/IN the/DT history/NN but/CC no/DT information/NN was/VBD supplied/VBN although/IN the/DT manager/NN did/VBD give/VB me/PRP a/DT sketchy/JJ outline/NN ./.

this/DT is/VBZ a/DT wonderful/JJ old/JJ manor/NN in/IN the/DT countryside/NN just/RB outside/JJ rome/NN which/WDT was/VBD built/VBN in/IN the/DT 13th/JJ century/NN to/TO cater/VB for/IN pilgrims/NNS ./.

the/DT small/JJ wood-panelled/JJ bar/NN was/VBD also/RB deserted/VBN throughout/IN our/PRP$ visit/NN although/IN it/PRP was/VBD possible/JJ to/TO be/VB served/VBN aperitifs/NNS on/IN the/DT terrace/NN outside/IN the/DT restaurant/NN ./.

if/IN so/RB the/DT dining/NN room/NN and/CC outside/JJ bar/NN area/NN are/VBP out/IN of/IN bounds/NNS ./.

the/DT two/CD waiters/NNS were/VBD working/VBG like/IN trojans/NNS but/CC clearly/RB most/RBS off/RP the/DT staff/NN were/VBD servicing/VBG the/DT wedding/NN and/CC hotel/NN guests/NNS came/VBD second/JJ !/.

i/LS 'm/VBP currently/RB on/IN crutches/NNS and/CC had/VBD pre-warned/VBN the/DT hotel/NN ./.

as/IN other/JJ reviewers/NNS have/VBP mentioned/VBN ,/, it/PRP 's/VBZ worth/JJ checking/VBG if/IN a/DT wedding/NN is/VBZ taking/VBG place/NN when/WRB you/PRP stay/VBP ./.
