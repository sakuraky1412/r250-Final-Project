Pros:. I drive a paper route, and TomTom showed me things I didn't know (and things I knew, but didn't think TomTom would know) about a route I've been driving for a year!. 
Cons:. First nite out, I played with TomTom so much that my route took about 30 minutes longer than it should have... opps!. 
Summary:. I haven't used TomTom for a whole 24 hours yet, nor have I been able to access this site properly, so all I can say now is "I wish I knew TomTom better." But I'll think twice before I 'poo-poo' my husband's ideas again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. I had a Garmin but my car was stolen. I decided to try a Tom Tom. It is SO much easier to use than the Garmin, easier to read, and the maps are more accurate.. 
Cons:. none. I wish new cars would have this system installed. 
Summary:. Hmmmm.... I guess I'll repeat my pros statement. I had a Garmin, but my car was stolen. When I bought a new car, I decided to go with a Tom Tom, based on the positive experience of my brother-in-law. The Tom Tom is so much easier to use, easier to read, and the maps are more accurate. When my mother came to visit me I had her try it out. She is technologically phobic, but loved the Tom Tom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Effortless Driving. Plug In And Go!!!!. 
Cons:. None I Can See. 
Summary:. I Travel All Over Florida In Sales And This Makes It Truly A Joy!!! I Got The New 300 That Just Mounts To The Window And Pops Off When Done!!! Tiger GPS Is The Best Internet Sales Outfit I Have Dealt With!!!.

Pros:. Blandt de bedste. 
Cons:. Blandt de bedste. 
Summary:. Nok den bedste nav. p� markedet.. Meget nem at betjene, meget korrekte angivelser, bedre bliver det nok ikke.. 

$$;
Pros:. This little gadget is amazing. I put it up the vehicle in dash GPS and let me tell you, this little guy stood its ground. It is very simple to set up. It comes with everything you need to get going. It's very accurate, and the price is totally awsome. Hig. 
Cons:. What cons!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. ... that the "reviewer" Flower Child must have lost a few too many brain cells in the 60's. GPS *RECEIVERS* like those used in modern navigation systems do not transmit your position to satellites, they *RECEIVE* (as the name would suggest) data from sat. 

$$;
Pros:. Just to clarify what Flower Child said in his review...the GPS signals are 1 way, FROM the satellite...the GPS receiver triangulates your location from multiple receiver..the satellites have no idea where you are...they are broadcasting only and your GPS. 

$$;
Pros:. 3D nagivation is unique and clear, girlfriend can finally now understand what she is seeing. Touch screen is easy to use, with minimal instruction. Simple glass mount. LOUD speaker. 5 Hour Battery Life. Custom Favorites and Custom Points of Interest (try. 
Cons:. Screen could be brighter. It's not bad, but not as nice as my former Roadmate. Map data has errors, but not any worse than any other GPS. They all get their data from the same two-map suppliers. Neither is better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Flower Child ruined a forum that I was looking foward to reading. Such idiotic statements should be purged from CNET.com. Can we please get back on subject... is there anybody out there that has some experience with this product?. 

$$;
Pros:. I don't have this system, I just want to respond to the misinformation posted by Flower Child. GPS satellites DO NOT KNOW WHERE YOU ARE! These receivers work by collecting multiple accurate time signals from satellites, computing your position in 3D. OnSt. 
Cons:. I don't know of any, but I wanted to set the record straight for the misinformed.. 

$$;
Pros:. This product is fantastic! I have nothing but praises for it!. 
Cons:. Like a previous poster said, it does loose it's signal from time to time, but that's to be expected in areas with lots of large buildings.. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS satellites do not track anyone, but provide ground coordinates to the Receiver. They only work one way Satellites to the ground!. 

$$;
Pros:. Don't own one, but own another TomTom product, and it's excellent. Now, Flower Child, actually, you are quite mistaken. GPS receivers are a one way road, they triangulate your position based on transmissions from satellites, and do NOT rebroadcast your. 
Cons:. The GPS receiver and display are one unit, meaning that instead of placing the unit in a place that is comfortable for you to see and touch, it must be placed in a location where it can get adequate locks on satellites. If you own a compatable Palm or iP. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS does not track you. It is a RECEIVER. Onstar sends the GPS location via cellphone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Dude, this is just a receiver, um, ONSTAR is a godamn sattelite telephone!!! I think you should really pull your head out...The window in your stomach you see through is fogging.... 

$$;
Pros:. I'm writing because of Flower Child's paranoia. Yep, read the bible. HOWEVER, these are RECEIVERS like TELEVISIONS OR RADIOS, the "government" can't track them. They can't find Bin Laden, how are they going to find a receiver?. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright screen, verbal and visual direction. 
Cons:. Weighty. Centre of gravity seems to be top heavy causing it to rollover when placed on flat surface.. 
Summary:. Haven't found anything to complain about with the important issue. How does this navigate you to your destination. Works flawlessly. However the map for my area is accurate, but major roads are still logged in as "county" roads. The county roads were named over 15 years ago. TomTom recognizes this by using both names, but I still find it somewhat irritating. Voice direction is what it is all about and it's excellent. Door to door instruction, with visual cues that can't be missed. This is one of those items that you may say to yourself "how did I get around without it for so long?". 

$$;
Pros:. clear, easy to hear and follow directions. allows for 'on the fly' location of points of interest from restaurants to gas stations to beaches and hospitals. Will re-adjust route w/o modification.. 
Cons:. I would not suggest you type in location as you drive. small touch screen to type and drive. not 100% accurate, but thats more a result of the gps not the tom tom. 
Summary:. I have had the tomtom for 2 months now and travel as a sales rep. If you are looking for an on the go, quick, easy and accurate gps, this is the product for you. easy installation, easy to follow directions, user friendly. Saves favorites, recent destinations and all in all I only regret I waited to purchase. I also love the option to choose language speficic voices to guide you on your journey. All in all - TERRIFIC product.. 

$$;
Pros:. flexible, intuitive, basic. 
Cons:. doesn't have high end features.. 
Summary:. This is a good overall gps, for a reasonable price. It get's me where I'm going! I compared to Garmin and Magellan, and found this unit as good or better than those. The feature set is limited compared to units costing twice as much, but you get what you pay for!. 

$$;
Pros:. In 3-4 minutes you will be a pro at using this thing - its that easy, excellent screen, terrific voice guidance, maps are exceptional, and the superb graphics make it actually fun to drive. 
Cons:. None that I can think of. 
Summary:. I was traveling on business when this product showed up at my house. In the intervening DAY, my girlfriend had essentially adopted it. She had it up and running and had used it to run several errands in Boston and just loved it. The product is remarkably easy to use, looks very slick (amazing how big the screen looks considering the TomTom is so small) and works flawlessly. Just a stellar product - much better than the overpriced options from Garmin. I bought the thing from crutchfield.com and it has been as useful and as fun as my iPod - everyone who has seen it is running off to buy one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great graphics, useful features, easy to use. 
Cons:. Some maps need updating, glare can make it hard to read. 
Summary:. This is my favorite toy. It's packed with features and is small enough to pack with me on trips. Just program in your destination and follow the voice prompts, supplemented by great, helpful graphics. If you make a wrong turn, it quickly recalculates the route to get you there from wherever you are.. It sometimes takes a few minutes to link up with the satellites when you first turn it on, but that should normally be a minor issue. I love that it figures out the fastest route, not the shortest. I also like it's estimate of arrival time that's constantly updated, based on your speed, the distance and the posted speed limits.. My quibbles would be a problem with any such units. For example, it gets confused when you're traveling along side (or under) an elevated highway - so it can give you bum directions if it thinks you're on the road above. Some of the maps are at least 9 years old, so you can end up "off the grid" if you're traveling in or to a new area/road. When it's dash mounted, as I have to mount mine, the glare on bright days can make it hard to see, no matter what way it's angled. The good news is the temporary mounting hardware gives you the option to pick a better spot if you have more flat surfaces within reach.. But it has performed beyond my expectations overall and looks like it was designed specificaly for my Toyota Highlander.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple interface. 
Cons:. dim view, tough to travel between sections of country. 
Summary:. I wanted a GPS for a recent trip from California to New Mexico and settled on the Tom Tom Go Plus. I got a great price (599) from Harmony Computers and took it on my trip, learning as I traveled. I chose a famale voice for audio directions, and soon Tom Tom became "Doris" as we traveled through California, Arizona and New Mexico.. Doris gave nearly flawless advice. Several times when our common sense told us Doris was wrong, she wasn't. Only two times did she get confused and give us directions we simply could not follow, like continuing on a dead end road, 0r telling us to turn left down a street when we had already arrived at our destination. The Tom Tom system is pretty easy to use right out of the box.. My gripes:. 1) The screen, set at maximum brightness is pretty darned hard to read sitting on my dash when I'm wearing sunglasses. I haven't tried or even seen any other GPS units, so I don't know how it compares with others, but it's a pain to have to remove my prescription sunglasses to see some fine point that Tom Tom is displaying.. 2) The Go Go Plus model, which I bought, has the advantage of having all the US maps on one SD card. However, a user still has to select regional maps to find anything but major highways in 'other' regions. For instance, in traveling from Kingman Arizona to Alburquerque New Mexico, I could not enter my hotel address in Alburquerque when I was traveling with my Western States map loaded... New Mexico, accoring to Tom Tom, is a Southern state and is mapped in another region. If I selected that Southern map when I was still physically in Arizona, Tom Tom had no idea how to map my present location. The way around this is to use the Major US Highway map and create a pseudo destination at a major highway intersection near your true destination... this allows you to see both where you are and where you are going.. 3. Tom Tom sometimes has funny ways of getting you to your destination. I suspect all GPS units do this. I used it in my neighborhood and it concocted some truly creative ways to get me places. What is truly amazing is to see how quickly the unit recalculates routes when you don't make the turn that it tells you to... within seconds, it comes up with a new way to get you to your destination.. All in all, I'm pleased with the unit, despite the small gripes. It's small, easy to use and provides interesting feedback on your trip, including vehical speed, time and distance to the next turn, and points of interest along the way.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use touch screen. Simple to mount and remove when not using it and for security.. 
Cons:. Like all Gps machines there are small errors in the maps.. 
Summary:. I would not like to be without my TTG. As I become more experience in its use I am finding tha I rely on it more. As the upgrades become available its usefulness is increasing. The latest Post Code file is an invaluable aid. Use the windscreen mount as the stick on dash board mount is not removeable. I would like to advise the use of an external antenna as this definately speeds up satalite aquisition and TTG accuaracy. A anti glare screen would be useful together with a touch screen protector.. 

$$;
Pros:. Touch screen. 
Cons:. Sometimes awkward to put back on its holder. 
Summary:. I bought this for my wifes car and find it is nicer than the command system (�2,500) in my 'S' class Mercedes.(Not that that system is bad!) I cannot fault it. . The one we have is GO 300, with clarity of voice and ease of use.

Pros:. gets me around london better than the stop start of map reading !. 
Cons:. cant get accessories easy !!.

$$;
Pros:. bird-eye 3D is awesome, detail maps, fantastic voice command, crystal clear color screen, easy transfer between vehicles. strong GPS signal. 
Cons:. the map database is not error free (but who has one?) need to click several buttons before you can see the compus, it would be nice if it can display on the main screen - not sure if I am wrong.. 
Summary:. I spent two weeks reading reviews before I make decision which GPS best suit my husband. After rebate and shipping I paid $530 for tomtom go. Me and my husband couldn't be any happier with our new toy. To save money we got a standard 256MB meomory card. We erased it and reload the detail maps on several states we visit frequently. It basically change the way you feel about your surrounding when driving. before I never aware of how many GPS satellite on top of my head now I know the exact number. You see the road name before you see the physical road sign. anyone lack of sense of direction and those who on the road frequently should definitely have one. This is not a perfect machine you can reply on 100%, keep in mind the route given may not be the best route, but it will get you there pretty much for sure. You still need to use your brain to judge if the command make sense. I would say 99% of time it's correct and accurate. It's great help for my husband since he need to be on the road visit new place on daily basis, tomtom go very worth to have for him. I rarely visit new place and I am a great map reader with great sense of direction so that I won't pay this much money to own something not neccessary. I consider this is a luxury item for me but essential item for my husband. I won't complain the database is not complete, the database offers way more options than I really need. who has the complete list of all the commercial then? Let's say I need to find a restaurant, tomtom go offers 300+ restaurant within 5 miles radius, I won't complain tomtom go didn't include the newest 3 restaurants, I even don't go through the entire list to make a decision where to eat anyway.. get yourself one if money is not an issue. make sure you got the upgraded 1GB memory so that you can load the entire US map. compare to other brand? I have no idea, I know they are more expensive and the screen not as this big. database are pretty from the same supplier.. Comments about child flower argument: child flower is lack of knowledge and have wired fear about govenment that's for sure. but he/she got way more penalties than he/she desired.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use. 
Cons:. more memory to hold all maps. 
Summary:. I can't believe some of these reviews. A chimp couldn't mess this thing up! Add the region of where you are/going and thats it! Extremely accurate maps and Directions! Highly recommend it to anyone who travels a lot.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, size, ease of use, great 3D view. 
Cons:. Doesn't always give one the best route.. 
Summary:. I purchased my Tomtom Go Plus in December and have been very satisfied with it.. When I first ordered my Tomtom (Tom for short), I received an Email that they were out of the Tomtom Go, but did have the Tomtom Go Plus. The Tomtom company gave me a free upgrade. The Plus has a major advantage in that the maps are all preloaded on a 1GB SD card. If you don't opt for the Plus version, you could purchase an SD card for under $100 and load the maps yourself.. SETUP: Very easy to use and set up out of the box (although I did have to call Tomtom before I figured out that one has to change the region when first using it (Northwest, Southwest, Northeast, etc.).. MOUNTING: I read one review which mentioned that the mounting base damaged the car's interior. I used the suction device which comes with Tom and allows one to stick it on the front window. This suction device is very secure and is removed very easily when one needs to. It is very easy to transfer from one car to another.. POWER: So far, I haven't needed to use the car adapter. I charge up Tom and it is good to go for several hours at a time. For longer trips, one would need to use the adapter.. ACCURACY OF DIRECTIONS: The one thing that I noticed is that Tom doesn't always give one the quickest route. If you are going on a long trip, you should have an idea of what the best route to take is. However, Tom WILL get you there. I have used it in New York, Washington DC and in Florida. I found the directions to be excellent, especially in Florida where I frequently had no idea where I was going!!. I did find that there were some streets missing in Florida. However, I was surprised to find some short dirt roads with only 3 houses in Maine.. DISPLAY: I love the 3 D display!! That is one of the features that many people who have seen my Tomtom admire the most. It gives one such a realistic view of the upcoming road with its curves, etc.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive controls, EASY to use. Good display in 3d nav with legible cross street names. Chooses routes that make sense. Nice speaker quality. Great value.. 
Cons:. Points of Interest database not as complete as some other systems.. 

$$;
Pros:. this is my 3rd GPS and it is awesome.....great view, easy to istall and use, directions are great and very very accurate. also support responce is way to quick. 
Cons:. i donot think of any except the map data bases are not connected to each other.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small compact,and accurate, just what I need, goes from car to car very easily, and has an internal battery.. 
Cons:. Screen gets washed out in bright sunlight, not neccessarily good for cross country driving, only operates region by region. There is a major roads map, but it would be nice to have detail on a cost to coast trip (which I do from time to time). 

$$;
Pros:. I LOVE the Tom Tom Go! I considered buying a few different GPS devices, and I am thankful that I bought this one. The screen is so easy to see (regardless of sunlight), it is extremely easy to use, and I can always get a strong signal. My favorite functio. 
Cons:. It always gets me from point A to point B, but not always the quickest way possible. It gives sesnds me the most direct way, not the fastest.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, removable all good features of PDA navigation without the hazzle of installation. 
Cons:. some vehicles will experience some problems with the buildt in antenna, allthough an extra external is available. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and accurate the coolest product that I have ever used.. 
Cons:. would be perfect if it was Macintosh compatible but thats only negative thing I can say about it.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, and fun!. 
Cons:. can't add upload you address book. 
Summary:. The main problem is that when you connect to your computer, you can upload your phone book and then using bluetooth, speak over the TomTom via your Treo650, which is very nice, BUT the addresses associated with those phone numbers are not available for navigation! I was very surprised to learn this, considering that the main use for the TomTom is navigation, not as a car phone kit. Perhaps they will add this feature to their software someday. Meanwhile, when I contacted them they told me how to add the addresses ONE-BY-ONE as Favorites. That would take me a few days, since I have MANY ADDRESSES to add. This company seems to have good ideas and the unit has a very nice design, so I hope they will provide a software upgrade. I wouldn't think that it would be too difficult to do.. Updated. on Nov 9, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. fast satellite acquisition; address memory; accurate to street level; many "extra" options; clear, easy to see/read screen; early turn warning; shown me some short cuts; very user friendly. 
Cons:. rarely accurate to street # location; some dead ends show as a thru street (but so do some maps); it doesn't know all the shortcuts I do and will take me the long way around. 
Summary:. I am a home health nurse, and to say I get around is an understatement! Before I got this GPS, I used a map, thinking... what do I need a GPS for? I have my trusty map. Uhhh, duhh.... I can't even imagine driving without it now! Thanks Mom!. My home territory is the mountains of east TN. I have never had a problem with satellite acquisition. On dreary days it may take 2 minutes to acquire instead of 2 seconds, but it has never failed to acquire. It saves me time, too. Since I don't have to search the map to plan my route and stop several times to make sure I'm going in the right direction, I just plug in the info and go! Also, it remembers previously entered info. Which is great if you haven't been back to the area in awhile and don't remember exactly where to go, it remembers for you. Or, if you're travelling, just plug in the address to where you're staying and go explore the area, confident you'll get back to the hotel w/o any trouble. It also has a "home" feature. Just plug in your home address once and it becomes a "one touch" to get you home. This is a very nice feature. You can also save your office address as a favorite. Sort of a speed dial feature.. One downfall is the mounting mechanism. It took me quite some time to figure out the best location for the mount. My biggest gripe was that the whole thing (mounting base, arm and unit) was so big it obstructed my view, no matter where I mounted it on the windshield. Also, I noticed when the sun beat down on it, the suction didn't take or last long. This was a bummer. So, being the "velcro queen" that I am (a nickname given to me by my husband) I took the part the base that the unit actually clicks into and velcro'd it to the left side of the dash in my line of sight but out of the way. Here, I can see it with a simple glance to the left (w/o even having to move my head), no different than checking the rearview mirror. Sitting on the dash, I can see it and it doesn't block my view of the road at all!. The screen is very bright for day time use and at night, I switch to "night colors", otherwise, it is too bright for night. If you use the voice, it gives plenty of notice before your turn, however, it can be quite the nag if you take a shortcut it doesn't know. It nags you to turn around. In it's defense, it does readjust to the new route as soon as it figures out you're not going to turn around! So, I shut off the voice when I'm in familiar territory. I still use it in familiar territory, tho, because it gives the name of the streets and shows you exactly where your turn is, which is very helpful to me. It seems like every time I'm looking for an address (no matter how far out in nowheresville I may be, there is ALWAYS some car riding my butt, and slamming on the brakes for a missed turn would not be a good idea! So "Ken" (the name of the Australian voice) comes in handy no matter where I am.. I read a lot of these reviews before I made my choice to buy, and some of the things I read that gave me pause were things I now believe to be user issues. Such as, several reviews said that the unit worked great for a few weeks and then the screen went black. Maybe I just got lucky and got a good unit, but I've had mine for over 3 months now and absolutely no problems. I think the reason is, I take the unit inside the house every night. I don't leave it in the window with the sun on it (I accidentally left it in the window while I was in with a patient for only 30 minutes, and it was too hot to touch when I came out), so I learned my lesson and put it in the shade at all times. Even if it means taking it off the mount and putting it under the seat. You wouldn't leave your cell phone in the direct sun, would you? Also, I keep it in the case that comes with it wnenever it's not in use. If you take these precautions to safeguard it, I think you will be as happy with it as I am. It's just starting to get cold outside now (mid Oct) and I'm inclined to believe extreme cold will be as detrimental as extreme heat. "Ken" will be coming inside with me every night. This is a huge investment (the Go 300 was $500) but, if you take care of it, it will serve you well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding routing advice; intuitive interface. 
Cons:. Screen is polarized, meaning polarized sunglasses may render it black. 
Summary:. Boy was I excited to start using my TomTom Go. I turned it on, backed out of my driveway, put on my sunglasses, and thought, "did I turn it on?" Puzzled, I cocked my head to the right, and suddenly could see the screen just fine. So, as long as I didn't mind driving with my head 45 degrees to the left or right, it was perfectly usable during daylight hours.. That's too bad, because, having used a friend's Garmin 2620 (an excellent product that didn't have the polarization problem), I judged the interface and performance of the TomTom to be superior. The TomTom finds satellites at least as fast as did the Garmin 2620, but the map is much easier to understand and follow. In the Washington DC area, many ramps split into three or four exits, so "exit left" isn't sufficient. The TomTom offers similar audio prompts, but the close-up exit- and turn-maps more clearly highlight the proper exit ramp because the 3-D perspective looks a lot like what you're seeing out your windshield. Consequently, it provides very useful visuals in complicated navigation situations.. The TomTom Go has far fewer POIs (points of interest), which I thought initially would be of little consequence. But I quickly found myself wishing for more accurate and detailed restaurant information -- hey, once you've got one of these things, you feel suddenly free to go exploring other neighborhoods to see what's near your new home. ... Okay, maybe just I do that.. I wrote a note to TomTom tech support inquiring about the screen visualization problem. They replied about 2 weeks later saying they were unaware of the issue, but that they also had updated the screen for the new TomTom 300 and 700 (which I understand have 4000-color screens rather than the Go's 256-color screen). They said they hadn't tested the new or old screens with polarized sunglasses, so I imagine I won't try the new ones, either.. Sent it back reluctantly because of the screen problem. If not for that, I would be tickled pink with the TomTom Go.. 

$$;
Pros:. Functions well, very easy to use, great value for price, firmware v5 will be huge improvement. 
Cons:. Menus a little quirky, keyboard small, screen glare, map software quirky too.. 
Summary:. Most people who have posted comments have summed up the good points already. The unit is small, stylish and looks good in your car. The screen is bright and very sensitive. The controls are intuitive and easy to master. The unit has a good number of options, such as: many different voices, day/night colors, different map colors, 2-D vs. 3-D map views. I like the ability to explore maps at will, and create routes without being in the car or using the GPS--this makes it like a mapquest.com and GPS navigator in one. The unit is very good about allowing you to avoid certain streets. It calculates routes quickly, and is quick to help you when you miss a turn.. Some people complain that the unit does not give you the BEST route. It is asking a lot for software to find the absolute BEST route available. This unit will get you from point A to B along a REASONABLE route, which is what it was designed to do. If you want the BEST route, you might be expecting too much.. I've used the Magellan units with Hertz and their voice prompts are annoying, especially with the bing-bongs. This unit has about 77 words it can use, which is enough to tell me clearly what I need to do. It warns me about the turn coming up and gives me the distance (in yards), then tells me to turn at the turn, and that is it. I find it just the right amount of info.. The built-in speaker is incredible. I read a review showing cut-aways and the unit is almost all speaker. Volume control that is speed-sensitive will be added in firmware v5.0.. The Secure Digital (SD) card came pre-loaded with a Major Roadways of America (MRA) map, and all the voices. This map is MUCH more complete than the MRA map on the included CDs. My impression is that the MRA map on the SD card is a compressed version of the entire US. I installed my local region to the card and can't see any difference between the two... I bought a larger SD card and instead of installing everything anew from the CDs, I copied the files from the old card to my hard-drive and then from the hard-drive to the new card. If you use *ix (Mac OS X, linux or unix) you can easily mount the unit as a USB drive and copy with cp, rsync, etc. My main point through is that the 256K card that came with the unit is big enough since the included MRA on the card seems incredibly complete.. The ASN feature (dead-reckoning, whatever you want to call it) works OK but not great. Going through a tunnel, it thought I kept accelerating and had me going 110 mph by the end of the tunnel. No big deal really since it then realized it was wrong, the map went grey and it sat idle until I reestablished GPS signal.. Many features are missing from this unit with firmware 4.*, but will be added shortly with version 5.0. I can't wait for that to come out!! It will make an already great machine that much better.. Now for some cons.. 1. you have to navigate through a few levels of menus to get to some common features. That is why I say the menus are quirky. I think that changing volume or brightness are very important and should be in the first page of options under Preferences, but they are burried much deeper. So it means a few extra clicks to get to things you need more often.. 2. The screen is a little small and as a result, the keyboard is small. I've had to correct spelling a few times since my finger hit the letter next to what I wanted. Solutions include being more careful, or using a sylus. On my wish list would be a stylus holder for the car mount.. 3. Since the screen is small, so is some of the text that it gives you. I have good eyesight but I would have liked the info on the bottom right to be a few points larger. 4. The screen is very shiney and suffers a lot from glare. A few companies market screen protectors especially for this unit (search google) but they all seem over-priced to me. However, as with any PDA, if you touch the screen much, you really need a protector. I bought a pack of protectors from Fellowes for my Palm Pilot, and just cut one to side for the TomTom. Voila!. 5. The current map software (v 4.42) does not let me choose whether i want to take/avoid highways, use shortest time or distance, etc. This will be included on v5.0. As I noted above, it doesn't always give the fastest route, i.e. puts me on a street with a lot of lights when I know the next one down has fewer. As I said above, I don't expect the BEST route, just a reasonable one.. 6. I don't like the map-installation software at all. You get 8 CDs with maps on it, and each CD has its own executable to install things. First, why not put it all on one DVD. Second, why not install a program on my computer that I can run, and it figures out which CD I want. Right now, you put in CD1 and navigate through 4-5 screens to say install &lt;state&gt;, and it says "put in CD 3", so you put in that CD and navigate through 5-6 screens, install the map, and then you start over for the next one. This is a minor annoyance.. 7. The TomTom website is a little hard to navigate when you are looking for support. But there are a lot of great users groups out there who are very prompt on responding. There are links at tomtom.com, but 3 I like are mytomtom.com, pocketgpsworld.com, and expansys.com.. Executive Summary: This is a great machine, will get better with the newer firmware release. The cons are small compared to the pros, and at $550, this is a great value.. 

$$;
Pros:. Aesthetically pleasing, would get you to your destination eventually (if it's on the map). 
Cons:. I would bnot recommend this unit to anyone living in an area where new roads have been built over the past seven years.. 
Summary:. While this is the best GPS system that I've used to date, I hesitate to recommend it without reservation. The main problem is with the map. I find myself driving on roads that do not exist primarily because I live in an area that has experienced significant growth over the past ten years. If the product manufacturer can find a way to package more up-to-date mapping with the unit, it would be awesome.. The built-in automatic re-routing scheme is a definite plus.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great screen, lots of features. If you can't afford to get lost, buy it! Disregard the 'negative' bible thumper. This is a RECEIVER, it doesn't send a signal! Onstar- like a cell phone DOES. Get your facts straight ms paranoia!. 
Cons:. Not habing one. 

$$;
Pros:. Good overall functionality. Easy to use, quick, cheap (if you search around). 
Cons:. Previous post is incorrect. GPS does NOT track you, it is a passive technology. Your unit tracks the satallite locations, the sats dont track yours. Onstar knows your location becuase of cell phone technology and GPS used in tandem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to setup and use. Very easy to move between vehicles. Superb 3D view. Very clear screen and sound. UI very well thought out. Pro's EASILY outweigh the cons - I'm buying another one.. 
Cons:. Really naff base for dashboard mounting. Limited range of colour alternatives for maps. Doesn't have the language support I really wanted. Some instructions could do with being a little better expressed. Some inaccuracies on the UK map. Only a 128MB. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Battery and movable mount allow use in multiple vehical with minumum hassle and no wire. This product takes GPS to efficient and economical level.. 
Cons:. Screen is little on the small side. In city areas does not always find the most efficient route.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easiest product to use, outstrips PDA navigation by miles, one touch operation very simple once you learn how to use it. Long baterry life and can be used without being connected to an external power source. Large range of Points Of Interest allow gas s. 

$$;
Pros:. Better than you can built-in in most vehicles, this system is highly intuitive and easy to use. It will get you from A to B without (1) having to figure out how to get there and/or getting lost, and (2) without driving you crazy along the way. Bravo.. 
Cons:. Tomtom Go is so useful that I find myself wanting other features. Right now this device only "listens" to satellites and can't "speak" (the previous reviewer's 'biblical' warnings are wrong -- the satellites don't know who is watching them). Someday, thou. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright screen Fast navigation Superb 3d view Good battery life. 
Cons:. Would be nice if it had "route preference" options (quickest, shortest, no motorway etc.etc)..

Pros:. Great physical design, fast response to user input, excellent screen, comes with all maps of the US and Canada, maps appeared accurate for the addresses I checked.. 
Cons:. Can only load 1 region at a time. They give you a large assortment of regions but still, it is possible to have trips that always cross a region. They give you one national region including just the major roads but no points of interest. Therefore, thi. 

$$;
Pros:. Flower Child, GPS receivers are passive devices, meaning they receive satellite signals but do not broadcast them. Onstar is a different system, and not what's being reviewed here. How is it that you form strong opinions about things you don't understan. 

$$;
Pros:. To the reviewer who thinks that the satellits know where you are if you have one of these: You're wrong. These are receive only units, just like Directv dishes. Onstar is different. Moron.. 
Cons:. none. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use straight out of the box, very clear concise instructions, a very robust construction, very very pleased with mine.. 
Cons:. Not ALL postcodes are available, would be a much easier product to use if all you had to do was type in a post code.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Good software/maps. Much better than my Street Pilot III. Pay no attention to what Flower Child posted about it being a tracking device like On-Star. No signals are sent back to the sats. by any consumer GPS. On-Star recieves your location. 
Cons:. Need to clean screen often. Looses sat. signal a little easier than my SP III did.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great voice commands and other options, color, etc. Great carrying case and cool looking.. 
Cons:. Sometimes hard to see when sunlight hits it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use. Upgradeable to 4GB (if you have that sort of loose change to spend...) of map space with exchangeable SD cards. Calculates routes VERY fast and recalculates alternatives if you ignore the suggested route equally fast (one blink and the n. 
Cons:. Takes longer than my Garmins (III and V) to acquire satellites and is a bit quicker to lose then right at the start of a trip. Once it's got latched on, then it holds them well, though. I'd like a full-screen, 3D-type compass display as a feature. Also I'. 

$$;
Pros:. Virtual connection inside tunnels, touch screen, small size, what more do you want?!?. 
Cons:. to flower child: onstar is a service (that you pay for) that also combines communication ie 2 way from the unit. gps works on one way sat. to gps reciever. as it is your car records info on you all the time so maybe you should switch to horse and buggy. 

$$;
Pros:. Provides user with needed information during travel. It gives a sense of improved security to the driver. Easy to read and use ("hands free").. 
Cons:. Too expensive. Maps of Europe should be made available easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS signal is great, so is the display. Nice options and very easy to use.. 
Cons:. Since GPS is powered by pure evil, you may have to purchase an evil adapter for your car. These can be found at www.flower_child_is_a_fool.co m. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Fast satellite lock. Reliable mapping. Great suction-cup windshield mount. Clear voice. Fast screen updates. Convenient all-in-one unit.. 
Cons:. Lacks features of computer mapping software. Can choose secondary roads when main highways are faster.. 

$$;
Pros:. Touch screen is excellent. The unit is not big. It can be easily stuck on to the windshield, or fixed to the body with the included base plate. Quite accurate, takes less than 1 minute of driving to figure out the exact position. Quite portable. Lasts qui. 
Cons:. Yet to find one. Carry bag available at a later date.. 

$$;
Pros:. This funlooking, easy to use unit is working like a charm. Using it across the Netherlands I am well pleased with the way it works. The sound quality is pretty amazing for such a small unit. Screen is okay, works fine.. 
Cons:. It is kind of expensive, put some effort in finding the deal that is right for you. Personally I went for a deal in which detail maps for the whole of Europe were thrown in.. 

$$;
Pros:. This product is very good in for knowing your own position in the world. In response to the eariler post about the government watching and how onstar knows where you are, well The GPS SAts are senders only, not receivers. The way that On-Star knows wher. 

$$;
Pros:. I got my GPS about6 monthes ago and i couldnt live without it. i can go any where i want now and with no problem. i highly recommened this product.. 
Cons:. It kind of confuses you sometimes, it will not tell you in what direction to start in. We went to Universal Studios and it didnt give us directions untill we were on the interstate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looks,and seems to be very smooth running.. 
Cons:. If you read the bible,it will make you run out and buy this!. 

$$;
Pros:. good visual screen even in bright sunlight. Easily docks in and out for security reasons. Good voice clarity. On the whole I am very pleased with it so far.. 
Cons:. looses Sat Nav from time to time. It tends to choose a longer route when asking it to plot my route home. Although I have only used it in the city where I live at the moment. The custom TomTom GO pouch did not ship with the product, but will be availab. 

$$;
Pros:. Low cost, simple. 
Cons:. Can't see the screen when driver wears polarized glasses. 
Summary:. Get rid of the polarization TomTom. What a silly thing to do. Was this designed by our government?. 

$$;
Pros:. buena visivilidad, facil de programar. 
Cons:. mapas no actualizados. 
Summary:. Yo viajo mucho en Europa y Estados Unidos. Los mapas de Tom Tom no estan actualizados, en Italia y Francia tuve muchos problemas porque Tom Tom me mandaba a calles que no tienen entrada o muchas calles no aparecen en sus mapas, por ejemplo, en la ciudad de Torino en Italia Tom Tom me volvio loco para llevarme al centro de la ciudad, ya que me indicaba calles en las que no se puede girar, tambien me hizo lo mismo en la ciudad de Como, Italia y en la ciudad de Lyon, en Francia. LLEGO LA HORA DE QUE Tom Tom ACTUALIZE SUS MAPAS, LOS NOMBRES DE LAS CALLES Y LAS DIRECCIONES.. No tengo nada contra el programa, que es facil de usarlo y programarlo, pero no acepta muchos "favoritos" y todo el tiempo hay que borrar favoritos viejos para poder agregar los nuevos. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, intuitive, good in-car performance. 
Cons:. Software bug, screen not bright enough. 
Summary:. There are several versions of the TomTom. I have used the 500 (pictured) for nearly two years, and now have the 710 (the latest version).. The 500 is better than the 710: the screen is a little brighter and the speaker a little louder. Australian sunlight is a severe test of any display: the TomTom 710 has a new higher-resolution screen that is not quite bright enough for ease of use in Australian sunlight. It would be fine in northern climes.. With software version 610 they introduced a major bug: the machine will not switch off! Earlier versions of the software will switch off when you turn the car-key off. With the latest version, they did a quick-and-dirty patch to prevent the machine switching off if you go over a bump and momentarily disconnect the power. Well: I never suffered from the problem, but the cure is much worse than the disease. Now, switching off the TomTom is an extra thing to do before getting out of the car.. If you forget, the thing sits there glowing brightly advertising "Steal Me!!" to all the world until your car battery goes flat.. Other than that, the device works really well. The latest model has improved the RF sensitivity so it now operates well without an external antenna.. Two new features that are appreciated are the ability to change to a QWERTY keyboard, much easier for those of us who can type; and the ability to show whether you will arrive on time (so I can ring and say how late I will be...). The new mounting is "better". It's still a fiddle to mount and dismount the unit, but the new mount is better than the old one.. If they would only fix that maddening bug, I would give this product a "9"..

Pros:. product is cool and very user friendly.

$$;
Pros:. Simple, easy to use. Fast and generaly accurate.. 
Cons:. Some quirks. Locks up.. 
Summary:. It is a good product, but TomTom tech support is amoung the worse in the world. Normal response time from their website is 3-4 weeks. They don't answer their phone or return messages. Good if everything works out of the box.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. Support is not responsive. 
Summary:. Requests for help do not answer questions.. and there is no way to get help.. I even tried contacting Europe for help.. Although the product is good, one sometimes needs to know what to do.. I have the impression that the company operates entirely to its own satisfaction..

Pros:. Don't have the unit yet. 
Cons:. Don't have any. 
Summary:. PLEASE, People! Don't use this for an argumentative forum over whether a person is right or not about how a GPS functions. Thousands of us come here to view an objective CONSUMER AVERAGE RATING. With everyone making comments and arbitrarily placing a FALSE rating, it's drastically altering the Consumer Rating and tearing down one of the best features of CNET. Please, find another forum to argue your points. Thanks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Very fast in calculating and recalculating your route.. 
Cons:. Map data and POI database have too many errors. Made a trip from New York to Canada. 200 miles from destination point TomTom told me that "I have reached my destination". 

$$;
Pros:. Agree with all other reviews. Intergated product with v. good sound. Menu &#38; graphics is v. consumer inutitive and readable. Touch screen is very nice. Rechargeable battery is great for those who dont have cigarette lighters (waiting for docking port).. 
Cons:. Programming will often go out of its way to use expressways. Lose of signal can be quite long in alpine areas or through roads with numerous tunnels (but the ASN is a good feature). Does not like steep climbs in altitude when signal is lost and requiring.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really have no idea why you think THE BIBLE would have have anything to do with GPS Mapping systems, but I would guess you are still living in the 70`s by your handle so that would explain your "Conspiracy Theory" paranoia about them. As for how ONSTA. 
Cons:. I think Flower Child should stick to a NON-GPS based, permanently installed mapping system that uses DVD-ROM's for it's data and sensors on the wheels &#38; transmission to tell it which way it's going and how fast.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quote from Flower Child comment: "Cons: But, there is something that most people do not realize. GPS units work by tracking sattelites owned by the U.S. government. The sattelites then also know where you are." You are one brain dead individual. This de. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear Voice Instructions, 3D Map makes it easy to understand road junctions, fast recalculation of route. 
Cons:. Screen reflects light and is not bright enough for midday, GPS and map accuracy not perfect and several times I have found that it thinks I am on a different nearby road, Function to avoid roads good but roads (in particular motorways) are given in segmen. 

$$;
Pros:. To the person who wrote the "won't catch me with one" review : get your story straight. GPS is a one way street - that's why they are called "GPS *RECEIVERS*"! OnStar also sends data, but 99.9% of these nav systems simply *RECEIVE* location and time inf. 
Cons:. If the mounting base can't be removed without damaging a vehicle, this is not something anyone who keeps nice cars for only a couple years each wants!. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate GPS navigation. 
Cons:. Flower Child is clueless -- this is a GPS RECEIVER. The GPS satellites are one-way devices, providing timing beacons to the receiver. OnStar knows where you are because it's a two-way communications device that asks the GPS unit for its location. If you'r. 

$$;
Pros:. ... OnStar cannot find you via satellite, nor can this thing. OnStar knows where you are by cell-phone tracking that &gt;&gt;broadcasts&lt;&lt; your location. This thing has no transmitter.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its too bad that 'flower child' has no idea about how GPS works. This is a RECEIVER, NOT A TRANSCEIVER! It only receives GPS signals from the satellites, thus there is NO way for the government to track you with it. OnStar works by sending your coordinate. 
Cons:. Ignorant posters who don't understand technology. Even if it had a transceiver, what makes you think you're interesting enough for the government to track?. 

$$;
Pros:. Flower Child needs a lesson in how receivers work... and ONSTAR also uses cellular technology... TAKE a LESSON... "they" cant tell where you are by using a GPS receiver ! !. 

$$;
Pros:. System easy enough for a child to use.. 
Cons:. Your being folowed everywhere. When I bought my last car, it took the dealer 3 days to remove the "ON-Star" gps at my request. When he asked why, I simply smiled, and asked if he ever read 1984?. Come on America, get off your lazy ass and read a map !. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use. No one can track you with one of these! The previous writer shows an all to typical lack of understanding of science. The GPS unit is what knows where you are...not the satellite. The unit uses three satelites to triangulate the and c. 
Cons:. Fools who do not know how things work.. 

$$;
Pros:. i like the r2d2 shape and this is one of the easiest car units ive ever played with. it was a little expensive for my meager budget but it worked out well for my friends. an awesome unit!! and if you have to have one this is a good choice.. 
Cons:. the satellites do not track the unit, because it works on devil power not the more popular one way time transmission that the rest of the gps world relies on. only kidding. look up some info on the way gps works and then check out the onstar site and see. 

$$;
Pros:. it works groundbreaking product. 
Cons:. expensive, loading maps via card. 
Summary:. If your interested in TomTom GO, the new Lowrance IWay350c is a superior unit, less expensive (under $400 if you shop around) with a 5 gig hard drive you have detailed maps of the entire country preloaded, it will also display photos and play music via a card slot, not important features on a GPS but they're there, i hope CNet does a formal review sometime in the near future,,. 

$$;
Pros:. Bird's Eye View is great, and multiple voices is nice touch. 
Cons:. Screen info poorly laid out -- "yardage" turn prompts are always wrong.. 
Summary:. I had high hopes for this machine. I already had a Magellan 700 series. The Magellan technology looks and feels like it is rent-a-car quality (which it is), so I liked the look and feel of the Tom Tom.. Here's my opinion, good and bad:. First if you wear polorized sunglasses in your car, you will NOT be able to see the screen of the TOM Tom -- because of the coating. It is annyoing.. Second, unlike other GPS systems, the mounting bracket does not project far enough from the windshield -meaning- it is farther away from your eyes. I order the extended bracket, but just got email that it has been discontinued. Too Bad. You can mount it to your dash with a sticky glue, but if you care at all about your car interior you would never commit such a sin.. Third, the layout on the screen is poor. The maps are great, but the information such as the Name of the next street I'm turning on is in very small type -- approx. 8 point font. Try reading 8 point font 2 feet from your face when you don't know where you are going and are in heavy traffic doing 40 mph. On other GPS's, the name of the next street is printed clearly at the TOP, or at least in big letters. This is a major miss!. Fourth, it alerts you to turns by saying, for example, "Turn at 300 yards."(there is option for kilometers too). Maybe 2 or 3 times out of a hundred has the yardage been accurate. 300 yards is 3 football fields!--which is why it is shocking to think you have 3 football fields to plan your turn, when in fact you have maybe 50-75 yards. In other words, the location calculator is off. It is wierd because the map is accurate, but the voice prompts are way off. In my Magellan, it just s makes a loud beep and says "Turn Ahead". Very basic, but it worked - with plenty of realtime notice.. Fifth. I really, really want to keep this unit because the maps are great, and the different voices are neat -- I saw someone on Ebay actually selling an Austin Powers plug-in voice for the Tom Tom. However, despite how cool it is, it seems like the designers really missed the mark when it comes to useability under actual driving conditions. That being said, if you live in the country or a suburb, the unit would probably work out for you if you have a slower pace of life. However, if you are always on the go or live in a busy urban traffic area, this unit just doesn't cut it.. Sixth. The unit is nice and compact, and runs on rechargeable batteries (or plug), so it is ultra convenient to remove in a hurry.. Conclusion. Don't write off this unit -- but be warned of all of these issues. Maybe the next versions will fix with them. A week ago I got into my friend's Infiniti with built-in GPS, and it makes the Tom-Tom look like Chop-Chop. Hopefully GPS makers will come out with compact units with bigger screens soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, bright screen, intuitive navigation. 
Cons:. No audio jack for car/ motorcycle use. 
Summary:. I would love to have an audio jack for when I take it on my motorcycle. It's all very good to say it's portable and you can take it with you all the time. Satnav model il lighter, less bulky and has an audio jack. The screen and navigation is not as good and bright though. But the lack of audio output kills this product for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picked through most of the reviews before I made a decision and found the following: 1. The Tomtom is easy to use and has great asthetics but is functionally inferior to the Garmin products. 2. Flower child is completely out of her tree. Real far left Dea. 
Cons:. 1. Bad mapping from Tele Atlas. For some reason they seem to have some problems. 2. Flower Child seems to have parnoid instability from lack of a stable platform. Could have been from faulty early programing or contaminating the mother board with a chemic. 

$$;
Pros:. For that paranoid reviewer thinking that someone is tracking you - its portable. When whoever is moving in on you put in in someone elses car. Best looking one on the market. Recharable makes it no strings attached.. 
Cons:. Still wish there was a better way to mount/postion these things.. 

$$;
Pros:. You are an idiot. GPS receivers are RECEIVERS. That means they DON'T TRANSMIT. To even broadcast a signal back to the GPS satellites, you would need a couple more pieces of hardware. You would be stupid enough not to get the facts on everything before you. 
Cons:. A little lesson for you, little flower girl: 1) the bible says NOTHING about GPS, the government tracking you, OnStar, or any other nonsense you spouted. 2)go to google and type in "how does GPS work?" and follow the links. you will find unbiased informat. 

$$;
Pros:. reception is good with built-in antenna; reasonable price compared to other makes and probably better than Garmin, Magellan and Navman. Manufactured in Europe a big plus!. 
Cons:. not anywhere close to a built-in GPS from car manufacturer; cradle does not permit secure mounting and statement in manual is wrong that you dont need to use it, but the powercord plugs into the cradle base and not the unit! Also, you need a magnifying gl. 

$$;
Pros:. Don't even think of listening to the ignorance of Flower Child. GPS systems are RECEIVERS. The reason OnStar can tell where you are is becuase of the cell phone built into the system. They are given the GPS info only when you physically make a call to the. 
Cons:. Brand new product, so the software may not do as good a job at routing as more mature products from Garmin and Delorme.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size and mounting setup. Voice response is loud and clear. Easy to use after registering software to download maps. Quick response when using touch screen.. 
Cons:. Os-screen navagation text is a little too small, Map data (at least where I travel) has lots of errors. I have used several nave used several nav units and my favotite is still the Magellan Roadmate 700. More $$ but built-in hard drive means no PC downloa.

Pros:. Great Screen Very Portable Good Maps Fast Calculation of Routes. 
Cons:. Does not calculate shortest route. Some Maps outdated Customer Service Technical Support.

Pros:. Great product. Works very well, light, easily removed with a good volume level for the spoken instructions AND for the consipiracy theorists amongst you (and contrary to the mad posting by Flower Child!) satnav CANNOT be used to transmit your position W. 
Cons:. Abilility to import POIs for speedtraps ect. quite limited. Would like to see the option of a more permanent base.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are 24 GPS Satellites in geosynchronous orbit today and 2 spares. A small GPS Nav unit like this does NOT talk to a satellite so your location is NOT disclosed. Even OnStar simply transmits the location of your car ONLY when you press the panic bu. 

$$;
Pros:. Sounds like a great product!! Can't wait to try this one over my current GPS system.. 
Cons:. I can't believe there are people out there dumb enough to think the government has time to track you. Like they really care what you're doing day to day. Do you think your life is that interesting? If so then make a TV show about it you moron!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to follow map. 
Cons:. Updating your soft ware. 
Summary:. I paid $500 for a GO 300 2 years ago. All of the main streets I have found. I updated my software for $60, only for the southeast region consisting of 5 states. I have still not been able to find streets that have been built for 2 years. I called to make a complaint and they said o sorry. I will not receive a refund. The only thing I can do is go online and put a complaint with the address that is not found and once a large # of people make a complaint for the same address they will look into it. Not a good service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great interface, nice display, nice tracking usually. This is a nice unit that you can pack into whatever car you need to drive for that long trip.. 
Cons:. Lack of response from support is disturbing but that's nothing compared to the truly truly horrendous maps and the route calculation. I haven't even been able to use the "Point of Interest" features because I'm still busy trying to find my own street. The. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this as an Xmas present for a GPS-less vehicle, based on the strong cnet review. When reading the manual and playing with the device, it looked really nice, even compared to expensive units in other cars. The sound is clear and the map, though. 
Cons:. On initial set-up (not at all clear with multiple activation codes required, neither of which matched the code printed on the enclosed sheet) we discovered that my street was not in the map database, even though it was built 17 years ago and neighboring s. 

$$;
Pros:. Good screen, compact unit, easy to use. 
Cons:. Prefer double sided velcro to secure. Lack of some features e.g. avoid route during planning, tends to stick to major roads over shorter routes.. 

$$;
Pros:. EASY TO USE MENUS. NICE TOUCH SCREEN. WORKS RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. COMPLETE MAPS CDs INCLUDED.. 
Cons:. COST IS OVERPRICED. SCREEN IS TOO SMALL SO INFORMATION IS VERY HARD TO READ SO YOU BETTER HAVE GOOD EYE BALLS TO SEE THE WORDS. NOT TOO GOOD IN BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. ATTACH IT TO YOUR DASH AND GETTING IT OFF RIPPED MY DASH COVERING OFF ALSO. BATTERY NOT STANDA. 

$$;
Pros:. Handy and Inexpensive for the masses Note: Flower Child Have You Lost Your Mind? This thing does not transmit All it does is recieve a signal from as many as 12 different satellites at the same time and analyze the signals and plot your position Thats it.. 
Cons:. Quality wise its not likely to deal with industrial shock and daily use as the Garmins do Although manufacturers are tryin to make it look like these soft touch screens are the latest coolest grooviest cosmo stuff ... they aint gonna come close to the pro. 

$$;
Pros:. The previous comment on tracking is technically incorrect. GPS is one way. The GPS sattelite cluster does not know wjere you are.. 
Cons:. Systems such as Onstar (tm) work in conjunction with CDPD (Cellular Digital Packet Data) to send your location back to Onstar. If you look all Onstar equipped vehicles have a small cellular antenna on them. I did not want this incorrect post to scare of. 

$$;
Pros:. It is easy to navigate though the menu. A fun product when first purchased.. 
Cons:. While this product has many uses, in reality, it's nothing more than a novelty item not worth the money. In 99% of all cases I know where I'm traveling prior to departure. It pulls your eyes away from the road.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a wonderful invention at first glance. Ease of navigation, ease of use, good value, good reliability, etc. make it very appealing. I can see why everyone would want to own one.. 
Cons:. But, there is something that most people do not realize. GPS units work by tracking sattelites owned by the U.S. government. The sattelites then also know where you are. Ever wonder how OnStar can always figure out where you left your vehicle? They're. 

$$;
Pros:. SDK available though expensive. 
Cons:. Many features no longer work with the current software (see below). 
Summary:. I've had my Go 700 just over a year now. The new USA map came out finally and I bought it ($135) only to find:. It is STILL 3 years out of date for my area (Austin Texas) But this an improvement over the map it came with.. To install the new map you need to upgrade to the 6.x OS. None of the 6.x OS versions works with hands free any more. (Answers call but does not pass audio through to speakers. 5.x did work.). When the traffic expires you can not even buy a renewal for the US.. Customer support NEVER responds to email. They are rumored to answer the phone after 40 minutes.. They are so concerned with US customers not only do they only have euro values in their store but US is not even an option in the web store for the billing address. So you must buy through their upgrade app. Also if you still want the new maps be sure and get the DVD version. The down load version does not have many of the POIs your original map had and the DVD has more. The download version is named different from the DVD / shipped with unit version which also causes problems if you have favorites or POIs loaded. You will not find any of this out on the site but only by looking in forums not connected to the company. If I had found this out sooner I would have put that $135 towards a different GPS instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great interface, easy set up. 
Cons:. Maps are woefully out of date. 
Summary:. I bought this based on the great reviews on various sites(Cnet, Amazon). The set up was easy, screen very bright, and the interface is a dream. The first place I tried to map did not come up on TomToms map. The street was at least 5 years old. In fact, half the city I was traveling to was not mapped. TomToms website told me I could update the maps for $100. I don't think so!. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear screen, voice clear. 
Cons:. Pricey and No rerouting around traffic. 
Summary:. For the price this one misses a lot of features that other GPS like the Magellan 760. or even Garmin's 2720 does. Such as rerouting around traffic or multi-destination routing.. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface and features; very, very cool. 
Cons:. Outdated maps; mount not great in car with firm suspension. 
Summary:. I should have read these reviews about outdated maps before buying. Unit is very cool, easy to use, better than Magellan units I've seen on Hertz cars I've rented, but map data is horribly out of date. Outdated maps seriously limit value of the unit. Roads that have been around for years are missing.. Also, when I tried using in car with firm suspension, the long arm on the supplied window mount had the unit shaking around a lot. Works great in my sedan, but not sports car. You can order other mounts, but local stores don't carry.. Finally, I have Verizon Audiovox phone/pocketpc with bluetooth and high speed internet, but can't seem to get Tom Tom 700 to recognize it for connecting for data, though I have been able to use it as phone. When I go through internet connection, my phone is not on the list of known phones, and I failed when trying to configure manually. Realtime phone connection is cool idea, but implementation seems dodgy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to use and do not require electrical installation. Can be moved from vehicle to vehicle with little effort. 
Cons:. Takes a long time to boot from cold (10 mins on occasions) shortest route it takes is very often not the best route. But you dont know that until youre on your way. If you do then why use it? It also loses the signal frequently during the journey. Bett. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy for government gnomes to track me,then I don't have to wear my tinfoil helmet.. 
Cons:. Loses signals when I take my meds,then it's not so easy for government gnomes to track me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use. Excellent and loud voice commands. Very easy to enter addresses (that ARE on the map...). Very fast in calculating your route as well as recalculating after wrong turns.. 
Cons:. Screen can HARDLY be seen in direct sunlight (do not believe the sales talk). Recommends often a route which is NOT the fastest. WORST: the maps from Teleatlas are completely outdated even though I just bought the TomTom GO. There is one subdivision north. 

$$;
Pros:. The posting by Flower Child on 7/25 is quite humorous. He/she is obviously not well versed in GPS technology. GPS receivers calculate a position based on radio signals received from satellites in a geosynchronous orbit to essentially triangulate where it. 

$$;
Pros:. ... contrary to the above comment, using a GPS navigation system will NOT allow the government to track your movements, at least not on its own. The GPS navigator RECEIVES signals from earth-orbiting satellites--it's not nearly powerful enough to transmit. 

$$;
Pros:. "Won't Catch Me With One" Flower Child on 25-Jul-2004 10:44:17 AM "But, there is something that most people do not realize. GPS units work by tracking sattelites owned by the U.S. government. The sattelites then also know where you are." GPS recievers a. 

$$;
Pros:. takes me through the wrong part of town but gets me there.. 
Cons:. Not as good as the equipment on airforce one.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is in response to one person's comments that this product shouldn't be used due to the fact the gov't can track you. Only an ill informed person on GPS would make such a statement. The majority of GPS receivers are just that, receivers. They DO NOT t. 
Cons:. None.. 

$$;
Pros:. Full Color Display. 
Cons:. Bluetooth, Maps, No Manual.... 
Summary:. Bluetooth works with only a FEW types of phones, does not work with Blackberry.. A English US manual does not come with the unit, only a UK version.. The traffic is a huge pain to get working since the cell phones dont work with it.. Verizon DOES NOT work with TomTom, i have Verizon and it just doesnt work right.. It does not read text messages like the box says... I knew i should have bought a Garmin but i thought I would give this company a try, im staying away from ANYTHING made in the UK, just junk as everyone warned.... 

$$;
Pros:. Voice is clear. 
Cons:. Maps Maps Maps, thats what GPS is all about!. 
Summary:. Ok this may not be a problem for a lot of people using this unit but we have about 200 hundred streets that are not on our Tomtom. Whole developments! We live in a small town that measures 13 miles X 25 Miles with a poulation of about 40,000 people. Three years ago it was about 15,000. So the town is growing fast with a lot of developments bloming up every where. Now some of the streets have been there with no houses for two to four years. I have been to the Tele Atlas site and checked there maps and they are still not there. Tomtom has no way to preview their new maps online to see if new streets have been added and they charge $99.00 for map upgrades, That is a third of the price of the unit! Come on Tomtom maps should be a free upgrade, especially when they are so far behind to start with.. We used the unit in Las Vegas and was traveling on 159 to 15 north and the unit told us to take a right to enter the high way when in fact it was a left turn to enter the high way. If we had not seen the signs to get us on the high way we would have taken the wrong turn. You could see the map was wrong on the unit as it clearly showed a clover turn to the right. They are doing a lot of construction in Vegas and this is what I am talking about with maps. They did a change on that section of road and Tomtom had no idea! And it did not look like a new change!. The unit is ok to work with with minor quirks like "take the next left turn in 600 yards" when in fact it's about 75-50 yards. Some of the reviews on here state that the unit does not diplay streets of the next turn. I went through all the menus and had to turn on a lot of options to get the unit to display a lot items that it is capable of showing. They should just set them to be on in the first place!. First use, we set the unit up and stuck it on the winshield and locked it down by turning the lock on the suction cup. After about a half hour I was turning and the thing came sliding off the dash and hit the floor! So now I can't trust the suction cup to hold it to the glass.. To sum it all up, I would not buy this unit If I knew all the problems I would have with it, and checking their website and finding out map upgrades are 99.00 bucks. I had another unit and it did not have the ability to even upgrade the maps so we took it back. I would check around to see if other units give free map upgrades before buying this unit. We bought the 510 and the 910 has a lot of extra toys like being able to diplay pictures of all things on the screen and MP3 music throught the tiny speaker??? To much junk for a GPS????? Fix the maps! The one thing you need is a good mapping system and they charge you a lot for a map you can't even see online to verify the upgrade!. Suesue which way do I turn?? But that road is gone now!!! They moved it!!! Suesue I'm on a road!! Why don't you see it???. Very frustrating!!!!!. Oh contact them, I did!! They have a very nice computer generated responce!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice features, light weight. 
Cons:. customer service hard to get hold of, The instructions that come with the unit have no trouble shooting guide, on line help takes one to two buisness days. 
Summary:. Advertised most upto date map, However the map that came with mine is a least 5years old, they do offer a "free" update (shipping charge of $6.00). My experence I bought a "go 510" The US/Canada map that came with the unit was not uptodate, so I purchased a US South Central map online (The US/Canada map is "too large to download" according to the service people at TomTom Home) installed it, Took the unit out to the vehicle, and it died. So I exchanged it, for another go 510.. Hooked it up to the computer went to install the US Central Map--Problem the map was already installed on a previous device, so will not activate. I have now called service a total of 6 times each time a waiting period of 10-20 minutes. (three times I was hung up on, tiwce all I got to say was my name. I have spoken to "two" managers. The first said he would reset the device by 2pm that afternoon. That did not happen. Now I am being told they will fix/reset the device on Tuesday (due to the holiday). As for the online help, first, I had to wade through all the mickey mouse questions before I could get to a place where I could explain the problen. Then I was given the stardard answer of goto ttcode.com (another problem there when I selected additional help, it took me to a German site. My advice either wait until TomTom gets a few more bugs out of the system or look at thier compeditors. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to operate. Cool voice downloads. 
Cons:. maps were of NO use in my area.. 
Summary:. Great unit and would buy another if TomTom ever got it together with the maps. I live in Charleston SC and require a GPS as a real estate agent. The Tom Tom maps were at least 7-9 years out of date for my area. When i called customer service they said "no one else has complained" an that I would have to wait for a map update of which they expected within 12 months (oh great , thats a help!). The seller, getagps.com was awesome and let me send the unit back and I now use a Garmin which has very good maps that are up to date within 12 months!!. 

$$;
Pros:. good graphics. 
Cons:. everything else. 
Summary:. Could not locate alot of streets. Not able to search for a certian items. Just a terrible GPS. I bought it and turn around and sold it. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface - lousy support. 
Cons:. No support for bugs, just buy $oftware/map updates. 
Summary:. I purchase a TomTom for my spouse in September 2007 - Used it three times. When it automaticlly selects a route it said that unpaved roads were part of the route, even though they weren't - contacted support and they informed me that an updated map is available for download for $79 and this will fix my problem - This is the answer to fix my problem - spend more money and hope I don't have another bug or that this will fix the bug I do have.. 

$$;
Pros:. good graphics when it works. 
Cons:. turning on has its own mind, lousy holder, charger, etc.. 
Summary:. I like the 3D graphics when it works but this unit just has too many problems to deal with. First, the window mount stinks, it falls off constantly, and droops. They had a return policy but it is over so I'm stuck. The charger for the computer also is ill designed, the power point will not stay in and keeps falling to the floor, and the Tom Tom does not fit in the recharger, computer link easily, in fact when you think it is fitted, a simple touch and it falls out. When you turn the car off the unit does not go off but stays on untisl the battery is dead then dies and I have a hell of time getting it back. It often just goes blank and even when I push to power button it will not turn on. It does not hold a charge. The "manual" is a joke. My Garmin Quest, two years old sits next to it and does the job. I wish I could return this piece of junk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good little GPS, works OK. 
Cons:. When choosing routes, fastest looks for only freeways and shortest uses only side streets.. 
Summary:. Responding to an e-mail I purchased a dvd of "new maps" from TomTom and spent the next 2 weeks trying to install them. Online help gave absurd, robotic answers, phone service was a 25 minute wait and then after a 45min. walk-thru when it still crashed I found the phone assistant had hung up. When I asked to return the dvd and get my money back I was told that once the seal was broken I could do nothing.. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. 

$$;
Pros:. simple interface that anybody can use, Great Screen with good visiblity. 
Cons:. Lots of U-turns, wrong drictions, Location doesn't exist, and have lots of problems. 
Summary:. I have sold about a dozen of these things, and i have gotten 11 of them back in the 2 years i have been working in sales. It is a nice unit and is so simple anybody can use. But i have had customers go through 3 or 4 of them and then decide to switch to a different unit within a year. Everything from no connectivity, to the touch pad going out. And if you live in atlanta this is a BAIN! Unless you like taking 2 U-turns on the same road then and no location advailable? In my opinion this is one TomTom i would steer clear from. The TomTom One i have had no problems with, but i will no longer sale this to my customers.. 

$$;
Pros:. The only pro is that it's a GPS unit. I can find no special feature that one would consider a "pro"e. 
Cons:. Can't read the screen in daylight hours. Too bulky (notice how the bulge in the back is hidden in photos?). 
Summary:. The only way ANYONE is reviewing the TomTom favorably is if they are TomTom employees or if they have absolutely no experience with any other GPS unit. People in the early part of the 20th century thought the handling of a Model T was "very good".. Look, I've been using the TomTom in one of my cars for a year now. It's garbage! I just don't want to spend the $750-$1000 necessary to replace it. 1) Sceen is too dim. YOu can't even see the screen in daylight. This is NOT the case with any other GPS unit I've tried! ONLY TomTom. 2) Docking station is junk. 3) Batter "low" indicator is on at all times. I just have to guess as to the actual battery level. 4) No voice calling out the street onto which you will turn next (Garmin and Magellan have this and it's VERY helpfull). 5) Big bulky bulge on the back (notice how it's hidden on ALL promotional advertisements? That's because it's rediculous. I bought mine online and was surprised. 6) Takes forever for the satelites to link. Even in major cities. Sound quality is rediculous. Yea, go ahead and use the bluetooth to link to your phone and make calls.....that will not work.. I've never seen more major flaws on a device of this price. It's GARBAGE, plain and simple. My buddy has a nice, slim Garmin that's perfect. BRIGHT screen, voice that says the next street name (in case the next exit is actually a double or triple and you don't know which one to go with....this comes in VERY handy).. TomTom = junk. 

$$;
Pros:. none that differentiates itself. 
Cons:. maps are way out of date, require use of cell phone to update if any. 
Summary:. I bought the 300 series one.. I connected it to my PC to see if there were any updates to the maps. The site was circular on whether there were any available (just refreshes the page with no message indicating anything), so I wasn't able to update the maps that way. When I tried using the device to update the maps, it says I have to sync it with my phone first. I wasn't about to pay all those data charges to download maps, especially when I should be able to do it over the PC. So I can't say for sure there were no map updates, but there is no reasonable way to update the maps.. I'd say it found the addresses I wanted about 50% of the time, which is pathetic. I have lived in a fairly large town for the past 6 years, and one of the main thorough fares was simply listed as "Exit 46", not the street name. Not all highway exits show their exit number, plus it's not always clear by the screen / voice alone which is the correct exit.. Another issue was when changing highways, it wouldn't tell me whether I wanted north or south bound until it was too late. Given how these exits require an earlier decision than when the device thinks it's necessary, I guessed which direction I needed.. I was pretty disappointed that the maps were so out of date. It had problems in all three locations I used it in, including San Francisco, where the streets changed because of the earthquake over 5 years ago, but still didn't seem to be fully updated for this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size, good application. 
Cons:. The maps (from TeleAtlas I think) are wrong or not there at all. 
Summary:. I have used TomTom products before and always liked the interface and application but always had problems with the maps. When I saw the "Go" come out, I was hoping that they had switched to NAVTEQ data, but apparently not.. The maps (supplied by TeleAtlas) are very wrong in both major cities and most rural areas. It always accepts my address as a destination, but when I get there, I am miles away and end up having to ask for directions.. If I am buying a nav system or nav pda for this price, I want more than city to city direction, which the "Go" doesn't even get right most of the time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reviews are good. Price seemed fair until I found out it did not function as advertised (the unit does not know where it is). I thought that was the only reason to buy one of these things.. 
Cons:. Does not find or hold the satellites.. Watch my unit in action at:. http://eric.ewmeyer.com/mytomtomsucks. 
Summary:. I bought a Tom Tom GO 720 for a road trip this summer. We did it in a Class C RV and rarely got a signal. I assumed the large overhang was the reason it had a really hard time finding a signal. On the rare occasion it found a signal, it would never hold it. You would just have to hope it had a signal when you were about to make a turn.. I bought the unit in March 7th 2009. We finished our trip September 15th 2009.. After our trip, I tried the unit in a Ford Explorer. There is no way it should not find a signal in a Ford Explorer. There is a very clear view of the sky in that vehicle. Well, it acted the same. So now that I have internet again, I try their online support again (October 7th 2009). It did not help. They sent me a list of possible fixes that took forever to complete (testing between each possible fix).. 1) soft reset. 2) Download Updates. 3) Download and use "Clear Flash Tool". 4) Delete and reinstall the application. 5) Hard reset. Still not working, I find a customer service number on their website (866-486-6866).. After calling them, they say one more thing to try:. 6) Quick GPS fix (download this every 7 days to help it find the satellites). Found a signal that night! Maybe it worked? Next day I have go to use it in the car and it is frozen on the start up page with owner info. I try a soft reset. Problem fixed right? Well, got past the start up page, but no signal. That did not work so I call back again.. Of coarse, one more thing:. 7) Format the unit (a few more hours). This time it found a signal in about 5 minutes! Could it have worked? 30 seconds later it lost the signal. Same old TomTom that does not know where it is.. My advice to you is to send it back immediately if it does not find a signal right out of the box (My Garmin Vista hand-held units have always done that). Do not waste your time with customer service. They just hope to string you out long enough until you give up or their warranty is up. My experience with TomTom was the worst electronics purchase I have ever made.. I am uploading a video to YouTube to show you how my unit functions. Below is a link. This was taken late November on my way from Salt Lake City, UT to Steamboat Springs, CO. It took 3 1/2 hours to find a signal and then this is what happened when it found the signal.. http://eric.ewmeyer.com/mytomtomsucks. I hope you have a better experience than I do if you end up buying a Tom Tom.. Eric. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice voices, great ads. 
Cons:. Bad Maps, awful customer service, broken, not fixable. 
Summary:. Sorry, The Go looked good on paper, but the maps were out of date. When the unit froze, customer service didnt respond. When I finally reached a customer service rep, the agent was cranky and annoying without being helpful.. 

$$;
Pros:. mounts well on the window, good clear screen. 
Cons:. a bureaucratic nightmare of a website, can't add anything. 
Summary:. I tried to download an additional map for the US and Canada, I paid, and all I got was "Congratulations, your payment has been accepted.". Then I just needed to click on "Download All" and then they tell me: "Failure, no file.". So now I still don't have a map and have to call them to get the charge taken off. Worst, it took me over an hour of messing about to get to the point where I could order. I've wasted part of an evening and most of this morning just on getting a map of the US. I'm typing this warning as I'm waiting on hold listening to Muzak. Now the morning is almost over.. I have a product code. I have a device code. I have a problem reference #. I don't have a map for the US. I have instructions to go to ttcode.com to get an installation code when I fill out my product code and device code, the devicecode will appear, etc.. I have given up. I'll just ask for a refund from the credit card company. It's cheaper just to buy something else than keep fooling myself that with enough phonecalls I can actually get what I alrady paid for.. 

$$;
Pros:. None that I could find.. 
Cons:. Obsolete bad map. 
Summary:. Bought reconditioned tomtom 300 from Amazon.. Could not find our home address on it (lived in the same place for 9 years now.) Showed a nonexistent street. Directions for downtown bad. Called TOMTOM, they said, (on the 5th try) buy a new map for $99.95, on a supposedly reconditioned device. Could not persuade them to do otherwise. Returned product. Their service organization: talked to 4 people, all gave me bad advice. "Save the map restore it, download a map (could not be done free". Do not recommend buying this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good GPS unit.. 
Cons:. The service is awful. In fact, it's a rip off.. 
Summary:. I was quite happy with the unit. At the beginning of January 2007 I purchased a map upgrade from Tom Tom but there were some bugs in it.. I notified them and they told me that that map version had some problems and they would mail me an updated map. They told me that they could not put the updated map on my Tom Tom home account.. It has been 6 months and they keep reassuring me that the upgrade is coming.. I'm out almost 150 bucks. They refuse to give my money back.. Be careful.. 

$$;
Pros:. produst is excellent until it fails. 
Cons:. when it fails you cannot get support. 
Summary:. The maps provided are old and do not show roads that have been built in the last 3 years. When the product fails there is no support. The product works great until it fails. Power supply problems and FAT problems when modifying the POI data.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can't think of any. 
Cons:. Locks Up, On/Off switch located in a bad spot. 
Summary:. Locks up and when it does you have to let it run completely down before you can use it again, because it has a built in battery. Very bad directions, gets you off the highways too soon. Suction cup mount never stays on. On/Off switch located in a bad spot.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are no pros. 
Cons:. touchscreen goes out of alignment. 
Summary:. For over three weeks I have been trying to get TOMTOM to accept my unit for repair. When I called service they said it had to be referred to a higher level. They tell you they will call back and refuse to give you a contact number.. They NEVER call back. I have even gone to the trouble to call the home office in the Netherlands and got the same run around.. 

$$;
Pros:. The product itself seems adaquate from the end users viewpoint. 
Cons:. 4+ days to get a level two tech to call back and when thay do they are extreamly unresponsive. 
Summary:. Based on my satisfaction with a GO700, I purchased a TomTom 910 for my son about 30 days ago. After a few weeks the screen went dark. I called TomTom customer service to get a resolution. I was told that I would have to wait 3 to 4 days for a level two tech to call me back. 4 days later, no return call but an e-mail with an RMA number. I called again and was told to mail the unit to Concord, MA and since they were only a repair center that a cross shipment exchange could not be accomplished. After many more calls to TomTom I am now told that it can be up to two weeks before they return my original product back to me repaired!.
