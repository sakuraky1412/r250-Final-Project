Pros:. better performance than a new version DVD405. 
Cons:. better is only High Definition (HD) camcorder. 
Summary:. Sony DCR-DVD403:. Excellent low light performance! The best! In my opinion this the most important feature for a camcorder. Any camcorder can shoot well in great light.. Even DVD405/505 got worse performance. Check for 200% crops of the DCR-DVD403, DVD405, and DVD505 in the review:. http://www.camcorderinfo.com/content/Sony-DCR-DVD405-Camcorder-Review.htm. In my opinion DVD is more convenient and save format than miniDV tapes, never jam, can store forever, instant access to movie/image (no rewinding, forwarding), no accidental erases (not as with tapes).. I shoot always HQ mode (20 min per disc). I never shoot whole disc at once, even in one day. So, it was not an issue but I had concerns about before buying. I am not a heavy shooter. I do not shoot long clips. I used 11 DVD since 01/12/06.. I think it takes about 45-60 sec to change a full DVD to a new one. It takes about 6 sec to power up and shoot with DVD in that you have already shot on.. I used Sony and not-Sony DVD-R: WinData, Memorex and Verbatim. All worked just fine.. DVD-R can be read in any DVD player after finalization in the camcorder. The finalization of full 1.4Gb disc takes about 4 min.. I did not have problem reading finalized disc on my PCs either (XP, P4 and AMD). Just it has to be DVD drive that reads -R or -RW (minus), probably all of them do now.. After finalization movie and still images saved in 2 different folders. DVD403 keeps file indexing from DVD to DVD, so, by number you can say was shooting earlier or later (without checking file info)  very convenient to keep disc record library.. A finalized DVD autoplays a menu with first frame of each clip, 6 clips per screen, with date and time of shooting in order. I start a first one and see all one after another, or go back to menu and start any clip in any order.. Without the finalization I access my photos and movie clips via USB2 (480Mb/s) connection DVD403 to my PC with provided software (Picture Package Menu icon on a desktop).. Yes, DVD403 has spot focusing.. DVD403 can work as a DVD recorder via supplied AV/Svideo cable (can record TV programs, up to 60 min per disc). Its even easier with supplied remote commander, just press the button.. DVD403 has AV signal output to watch on TV your already recorded scenes and real-time shooting view. I use AV transmitter/receiver to watch and control recording from the distance placing the camcorder on a tripod to avoid attention to the camcorder and operator (hidden camera). The remote control is included.. Battery hold charge very well, never was an issue to run out of power on the scene.. Its an excellent DVD camcorder.. The next step is High Definition (HD) camcorder. I am going to sell it (craigslist.org) to upgrade to Sony HDR-SR1.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use; touch screen; AWESOME performance in low light!. 
Cons:. sony Picture Package Software; does not allow you to use memory stick for stills.. 
Summary:. After intense research on camcorders, i narrowed down my choices to the Panasonic GS250 and the Sony DCR-DVD403. Since the prices are quite the same, it is even more crucial to compare the two camcorders and their features.. [Number One being most significant, and last number being least significant]. Reasons i would choose GS250:. 1. Editor's choice at http://www.CNET.com. 2. 3 [seperate] chip CCD. This produces a more vibrant colors compared to 1 chip CCD's.. 3. More options for users.. 4. Decent still pictures.. Reasons i would choose the DVD403:. 1. MUCH Easier to use DVD's than Mini-Dv's (with Mini-Dv's becoming obsolete, much better to stick to dvd's). VERY easy to make copies while retaining original quality.. 2. Widescreen LCD (Touchscreen). 3. Analog to Digital recordings in a few "touches". {this allows you to record movies directly from your VCR/DVD RCA/S-video output to the camcorder A/V input}. 4. 3 MegaPixel still picture digital camera.. 5. Very Good Sony Online live chat customer support as well as 24 hour live phone support!. It is clear why i went with the Sony DCR-DVD403 over the Panasonic GS250. The reason i give this camcorder a 10 is simply because i think this is so far the best camcorder in the market (although it isn't perfect in some ways). I have taken about 10 hours of video, and only have had to use 3 mini DVD-RW's. The Picture Package software provided with the camera is aweful, but the way to get around is by using a 3rd party software (just click and drag). This way you can combine 3 mini-dvd's into a regular size dvd disc and have upto 1.5 hours of recording on each along with the stills. It is true that Mini dvd+/-rw's are expensive, but you'd only need to buy like 6 (3 hours of video), for regular use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good Video Quality, Ease of use, Recording Media, good sound quality. 
Cons:. Recording Media has very few Editing Choices, Not the very best in Night Light, Missing Noise Filters (that is how I want to call it), A little high price tag. 
Summary:. This is my first DVD Camcorder. I was a bit impressed by DCR-HC42 but, however wasn't a good fan of Mini-DV media. So, I started looking for a better option for a lazybones like me who doesn't care much about video editing after it is been recorded.. DCR-DVD 403 for sure, caught my eyes that gives very good features with no compromise on the video/image quality when compared against any Camcorders that fall in the same price range.. On the 5.1 Surround recording. The feature is real good. But, this captures the windy noise while recording in out-doors. I am using a cloth to cover the microphone to avoid this. I hope, Sony would have taken care of this in their latest DCR-DVD 405.. As a last word, I would say, this is an exceptional DVD camcorder and a product worth the price. My trips to Las Vegas and Florida would be remembered for ever. Thanks to DVD-405.. 

$$;
Pros:. Zeiss lens, "huge" CCD, IS, 5.1 sound cap, 10x zoom is not that bad and yet it take stills!. 
Cons:. No inputs for audio (or video), you need 100s of codecs to edit DVD MPEG. 
Summary:. As I said, remember the past.. Who dares to compare this tiny toy to those bulky SVHS camcorders of the 80s? Or even to the "not so bulky Hi8 cams?. Video is a matter of s/n ratio (among other criteria), and the DVD 403 rocks in S/N and other specs.. If you think you need (want) more, try a 3 CCD gear. Same quality (for prosumer cams) but 3 times the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great camera but no firewire or ilink?. 
Cons:. Terrible if you want to edit anything - nothing recognizes it!. 
Summary:. I gave it 10 only so that it would be at the top of the list and so that I could save you all the heartache of buying it!. Very very disappointed that I bought this camara.. I had thought from the reviews of this site and others - Wow what a great camera this will be perfect, with the DVD for access. This camara is good if you only want to film and show your friends but you not able to edit anything. To edit using the camera you have to use the VR mode - which basically means it wont work on any DVD machine - so what's the point?????. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good video quality. 
Cons:. No video lighting. 
Summary:. No worrying about the video quality on this one, that's for sure. 

$$;
Pros:. 16:9 LCD, awesome audio (indoors). Finally, where i can start about the direct DVD convenience. 
Cons:. Decent, but not great still quality. Non-tiltable (and hence nearly useless) view finder.. 
Summary:. When it was time for me to part with my MiniDV Panasonic PVDV400, I wasn't sure about. #1 Moving away from Panasonic which has been fantastic. #2 making the Call on DVD vs MiniDV.. Now that I have had the Sony for over 3 months, I have no dounts in my mind that I made the right call. The Direct to DVD convienience comes in more than handy when you record (no rev. or ffwd finding where is your current record position). Once completed, I finalize the disc and thro it into my DVD player or import it directly into my movie editing software for NO-COMPROSISE video transfer to my DVD. This was a problem with my previous MiniDV as I used RCA video capture which lost a bit during transfer.. The built in 5.1 audio recording works great as well.. I wish the camera did better on two fronts. 1. The mic is awful during outdoor shooting, as it picks up even a modest breeze and makes it sound like a typhoon. (Beach recordning is out of question, with so much wind noise). But well, for me as most of my recording has been indoors this hasn't been such a big deal.. 2. Sony should upgrade their software package to include at least the most basic of video editing and dvd creation functions. Unless you are planning to use your recording as-is, a DVD editing software purchase is nearly mandatory. After trying a few (pinnacle.. phew!), I settled with ULead Movie Factory and it has been great.. Overall its been a awesome camera and if not for the minor quirks above, this would have received my perfect 10.. 

$$;
Pros:. Versitile with great video and still features. 
Cons:. Menu structure could be better but it's still great. 
Summary:. Finally a great little digital camera that combines the best of video and still image capabilities in one great package. I really liked the cool night vision capabilities but I'm not sure that I would ever use that feature very much. The video composition software that comes with it makes it so easy to combine images and video in a few easy steps. They could have made it easier to add a utility to burn full size DVDs. Over all..... I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Have not recieved yet. 
Cons:. Bait and switch while ordering view closely.. 
Summary:. Do not be fooled by low prices on this dvd camcorder. I have already been to 5 sites to order this camera. These sites do not sell the camera with the battery cables connectors or anything that should come with a camera when you buy it. The lowest price I've found was at http://www.radioactivedeals.com. This comes with the complete package like you would expect. They also offer you at the time of purchase some very good prices on wide angle lenses and things like that. If you are looking for a straight forward place to buy this camera look no further. Dont call anyplace that has this camera for less than $670 because they are selling it without the essentials.. David Burleson. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Location of some buttons.. 
Summary:. Have had my camera 10 days now and was able to take awesome video without even reading the directions.. Sony has done it again.. Not crazy about the location of some of the buttons or the DVD. You have to lay the camcorder down and make sure the strap is out of the way in order to eject the DVD.. It's worth it............ 

$$;
Pros:. 5.1 Surround sound, Excellent video quality, Ease of use. 
Cons:. Wind noise, sensitive zoom button, awkward view finder. 
Summary:. I have been using this camera for the past 6 months and the more I use it the more I like it because I get use to it's lousy view finder and too sensitive of a zoom button. You can bypass the viewfinder by just using the LCD display. The 5.1 surround sound recording is awesome and gives your video products a very realistic sound. On the same token the microphone is so sensitive that sometime it picks up a lot of wind noise. I put a piece of dampener on mine and that took care of the problem. The video quality is superb. I only use its best quality setting. It gives you 20 mins of movie on that setting but if you need more then you have to use a new mini DVD disk which these days they run around $2.00 a pc. You can reformat it and use it again once you transfer your production to other media (5" DVD, etc.). contrary to Cnet's editor's comments, I find it that it is very easy to edit your movies with this camera. You'll have a very limited in-camera editing options but if you transfer your movies to your computer via a video editing software, then you'll be surprised what you can do with the movies you shot with this camera.. As far as still pictures go, I wouldn't make an 8 1/2 X 11 print out of the pictures taken by this camera but for any smaller size print out of your pictures this camera performs just fine.. One more thing is that, this camera can also act as an enhancer box. The device that you use to transfer VHS movies to digital DVD movies. That means you can connect your VHS recorder to this camera and transfer your old VHS tapes to DVD without any flickers or tracking problem. Now that is cool. Saves you couple of hundred $, if you are into that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Straight to DVD, compact, easy to navigate menu, 5.1 sound. 
Cons:. Camera works poorly in low light, slight fringing. 
Summary:. I love the camcorder and nearly everything about it. It has a great ergonomic design, is easy to use, the video looks quite good, and it even has a camera function that works pretty well in a pinch.. The only thing I was even slightly disappointed with is the camera, which takes a long time to write to DVD - if you have an actual digital camera that you want to use for snapshots, then you might want to bring it along.. Aside from that, this is a fantastic device.. 

$$;
Pros:. VIDEO QUALITY,STILL AND SOUND IS GREAT TOO,USB A DEFINITE. 
Cons:. NOTHING WORTH WYNING ABOUT. 
Summary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

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, great software, compact. 
Cons:. lcd screen is slightly small, cannot use view finder extension with battery in place.. 
Summary:. Been using this camera for about a month now. Have never written a review before but after using hte cam, felt i should write one. Great camera and was really impressed with the ease of use and the compactness of the cam. the only thing you need is probably lots of media but got about 9 dvd-rw on the net for about $24.00, so am set for some time. The software included is great too. I had been trying to edit some scenes from a video i had taken on my hi-8 camcorder using other software but had not been successful. Either I was too dumb or the s/w was difficult to use, but with the s/w included in the dvd403, it was a breeze. The only other problem I have encountered so far is the rear microphone captures the sounds of the cameraman and it is too loud. I guess i need to find out how I can reduce the sound captured from the rear mic. I haven't used the photo part of it yet so don't have any comments on it. I would say this is a great camera and would recomment it to anyone considering a dvd camcorder.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent audio/video, good design, sleek looking, 5.1 surround sound. 
Cons:. DVD+RW discs are hard to find, view finder does not tilt, LP recording does not give excellent quality, no Memory stick slot. 
Summary:. By far, this is probably the best camcorder i have seen/used. Sony camcorders are very popular mostly for their design and sleekness more than performance but with DVD403, Sony has proven everyone wrong and has outdone all the other competitors in the DVD arena. Certainly a winner, DVD403 has very little to improve upon.. Battery life is excellent and so is the simplicity in using the camcorder.. Hard to beat ..!!!. with a 3.2 MP dig camera, it would have been very useful to provide a memory stick slot (why not Sony?). 
Updated. Simplicity - One word that can describe this camcorder entirely. It takes less than 5 min to figure out the various functions. It cannot get any easier.. Pros: The list goes on, but here are the TOP 5. 1) 3 MP CCD...!!! - And a 3.2 MP digital still camera with FLASH. 2) 5.1 Surround sound recording - This rocks - (First I have ever heard about such a thing in camcorders.. was blown away). 3) Touch Screen - No messy buttons, very clean interface. 5) Good battery life - Get the FP90 for an increased battery life. 5) Clarity/Quality - is incomparable in this price range. Cons: (I am just being picky here, but Sony could improve this to make it the BEST). 1) Disc loading mechanism is a little difficult with the strap coming in the way. 2) A memory stick slot could have been useful, though not necessary. 3) A viewfinder that can tilt. 4) It weighs a little over 1 lb with the battery, could be a little lighter. 5) Pricey DVD+/-RW discs. If you are contemplating b/w DVD203 and DVD403, go with the 403, you wont be disappointed ..!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. 3 megapixel processor, great color, ease of operation, quick playback for instant gratification, and the discs can be easily backed up and then mailed to grandma and grandpa so they can see the kidos!. 
Cons:. viewfinder does not tilt or pivot. 
Summary:. After owning one other Sony camcorder and a very nice Canon digital camera, I did not think I would be ready to part with both of them so easily, but I am. This really is a nice camcorder/camera. The picture quality is excellent and after a couple of weeks I am ready to give it a strong recommendation to others seeking a serious dvd camcorder. I scoured the market and did not initially want to spend this much $$$, but after doing the research and now using the product I am very glad to have made the step up to the DVD403. It was money well spent.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, amazing video and sound quality for a consumer level product, excellent still photos, vibrant colors, able to shoot in low light with ease. 
Cons:. lack-luster editing software and currently available DVD-R's, -RW's, and +RW's, available are only 30 min. no biggie though.. 
Summary:. I just had the DCR-DVD 92 and returned it to get the DCR-DVD 403. The difference is amazing. First of all, the difference in the video and sound quality is staggering. The 403 really allows you to capture all the colors and sounds of the moment. The 92 was in a word...blah. The 800x digital zoom on the 92 was nice but that's about it. It basically let me take photo and video from very far away with very poor quality. In fact, my cell phone took better still pictures than the DCR-DVD 92. In my opinion, that feature is simply a waste on that camera. It's funny that in the same family of DVD camcorders, the big brother of this line really shines. The 403 is vastly superior in all respects.. Even down to simply getting a bigger battery, a remote control, and most importantly, a means to actual edit your footage or photos in your computer even though the supplied software leaves a bit to be desired. In any case, this camcorder is by and large the best I've ever owned hands down. I am sure that there will be a ton of advanced editing software available shortly that supports the mpeg2 format from this camera as well as DVD's with more storage capability. At least that's what I hope! =). 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, easy to use, outstanding quality. 
Cons:. Options a bit cumbersome to use. 
Summary:. I love this new technology. I replaced an old 8mm camcorder with this new one. What a difference! This camcorder is so compact and easy to use, and the quality is out of this world. I bought it at the beginning of a road trip and used it for graduation parties and amusement park trip. The colors and clarity were fantastic. Both the videos and still shots were great and I was able to easily use the mini-DVDs with my home computer for editing into an amateur production. I could not be happier with any other camcorder. I love having this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Vdeo/still image quality, ease of use. 
Cons:. Wind noise, price. 
Summary:. I am not a professional videographer. We have owned a Canon Hi-8 ES2000 for 10 years and it served us well until it died this year. We needed a replacement for our family videos.. I knew I wanted a hybrid camera that could do good video and average stills so I didn't have to take two cameras on vacation. Our digital camera is a Canon Digital Rebel and that certainly excels in the still image quality department, but not in the portability category. I looked at getting an affordable DV camcorder for $500 and then adding a nice 5 MP small still for another $300, but that still left me with 2 cameras to carry around.. I started looking at the crop of DVD camcorders earlier this year and the reviews scared me off. Reports of poor image quality and an overall poor bang for the buck lead me to miniDV instead.. That lead me to the Canon Optura 500 and the Sony DCR-PC350, two high end hybrid models. I went with the Canon because of brand loyalty. I used the Canon for 13 days and returned it. The low light performance was lacking and the controls were difficult for anyone to manipulate. I was going to get the Sony to try out but always put it off for some reason.. Our vacation to Mexico was quickly approaching so I logged on to check the PC350 prices and stumbled onto the DCR-DVD403 reviews and that piqued my miniDVD interest anew. Seemed like everything I needed so I bought it and brought it to Cancun for the family vacation. We filmed and snapped pics of everything, everywhere.. Sorry for the long intro, but I thought some background would help base the review properly. We are a family that really enjoys watching our videos for the memories, with little criticism of video quality. That is important only in so far as it should be transparent.. So, what did we think? This is a great camera for us. Video quality is very good. From our casual review, better than the Hi-8 and just as good as the Optura 500. The colors are rich, exposure is fine, focus is fast and accurate. The 16:9 is very nice. I rate it a 10 of 10 for us. It is transparent.. The zoom is a little unpredictable at times. Fast zooms are the norm until you get used to the zoom toggle's sensitivity.. The stills are very good. Shutter speed seems to be too slow to capture any motion at all, but for still objects, the images are great. As good as my old Kodak DC280 2MP still digital. I would rate it a 6 of 10 for stills when compared to my Digital Rebel. Most of the 6 is for convenience, but any image quality differences would be nearly impossible to detect at 4x6. Actually, the digital enhancement Sony applies in camera makes the images look better out of the Sony than out of the Digital Rebel. At least that's what my wife thought.. The only complaint so far is the wind noise. The beach with a 15 knot breeze sounded like a hurricane. At the pool one night with a light 5-8 knot breeze, the sound was dominated by wind noise. Hopefully Sony will fix this. In the mean time, I am going to put a small piece of foam over the mic to see if that cures the problem. Certainly not a show stopper, but something to be aware of.. Low light performance was very good; much, much better than the Optura 500. At the pool at night, we could see the kids swimming in the lit pool. At the beach at night, the night shot mode was good enough to capture us swinging in our hammocks in almost no light at all. Inside the house at night, the video looked bright and clear with no noise. Perfect for us.. Ease of use. This is where this camera beats everything else, hands down. We used DVD-RW's which held 30 minutes of video. No issues there at all. Just remember that stills eat up video time. We kept 10 DVD-RW's in the bag (2 per min DVD case). That was enough for the whole week for us. After we filled up a DVD, we finalized it and watched it in the kid's portable DVD player. To our pleasant surprise, the stills played at the end as well. By far, this is for us. I will transfer the miniDVD's to DVD later on and reuse the DVD-RW's. Hard to imagine a simpler way to do things.. As far as running the camera, it is as simple as it needs to be. My 2 daughters, 6 and 9, were both running it in video and still mode without issues. My wife, who is the defacto standard for measuring ease of use, had it all up and working fabulously without trouble. I have yet to open the manual. This thing is easy to use and requires no special effort to take great videos and stills.. Can't think of anything else to add except this is the perfect camera for us. The Optura 500 was nice, but not perfect. This camera was made for my family..

Pros:. DVD recording, sharp pictures, compact, excellent low light recording. 
Cons:. Battery time could be a little longer. 
Summary:. It's a great camera for anyone who wants a DVD recording quality and compact size. It's a true Sony product and it shows that Sony indeed is the best. Go for it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Video resolution;Camera resolution;lens;flash;everyth ing. 
Cons:. Zoom;nothing else. 
Summary:. The DVD403 has the best video resolution for DVD camcorders that I have seen out there. Whichever model you decide to choose make sure to review the video resolution as some models do not compare. The camera works great on here and now helps me eliminate having to carry the digital camera too. I am very happy with this purchase..

Pros:. Crystal Clear resolution, Carl Zeiss Vario Sonar king of lenses. 
Cons:. Well people will want to steal it... 
Summary:. A nearly perfect camera offering pro shots at ease, crystal clear, has remote control, Im very happy with it, integrated flash and many many accesories such as polarizing lenses and underwater gear as well, two thumbs up.

Pros:. See under opinion section. 
Cons:. See under opinion section. 
Summary:. I have got PAL version of this model few weeks ago. It has got the stunningly good performance with ease and convenience.. Briefly the Pros &#38; Cons:. PRO's:. 1. Convenience in playing back the recorded miniDVD in computer or set-top DVD players immediately after finalization.. 2. 3M-pixel CCD Resolution (3.05M still and 2M video effective pixels). (1/3 inch size CCD means better video quality). 3. Very good low light performance. 4. No need of rewinding, forwarding for blank space search with miniDV.. 5. No possibility of accidentally video getting overwritten as with miniDV (in case of overlook). 6. 16:9 recording (Wide). 7. 5.1 Channel Dolby digital surround sound recording and in-built 5.1 ch enabled mic.. 8. Excellent still quality equal to digital camera of 3M. 9. Can edit MPEG2 after downloading clips from miniDVD and finally record into bigger DVD.. 10. Provided software does the conversion of audio from 5.1 ch to stereo for compatilbility with many softwares. Till 5.1 ch enabled encoding softwares are available, the miniDVD could be copied directly to 12cm DVD without loosing such audio performance for home theatres.. 11. DVD-RW usage is more economical for recording usage over long-term. May rerecord for 1000 times approx.. Cons:. 1. DVD (MPEG2) format is not recommended over DV for extensive editing.. 2. May need to change miniDVD's (30min SP) for recording more often than a miniDV tapes (1 Hr. SP). But, this is not an issue for most of us as we may take a logical break (Standby during unimportant scene) well with-in less than 30 min to change the mini DVD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding videos, good touch screen, convenient operation, easy to pop into your dvd player after recording. 
Cons:. relatively expensive dvd disks (someone is making a buck here!). 
Summary:. This camcorder packs a lot of punch into a small, efficient package. It is relatively pricey but you get a lot of features in return. The videos are crisp and clear and this is really what it is all about. The touchscreen is quite convenient. Sound is great and it records in 5.1 digital surround. The small dvd's can be finalized and played right in most dvd players without a lot of fuss or lengthy transformations via computer programs. The small dvd's are relatively expensive (someone is making a killing on these things) but if you get the RW disks, you can then transfer them over to a cheaper media (e.g. DVD+R). Outstanding product Sony!. 

$$;
Pros:. 3CCD, excellent low light videos, easy play back of recorded video, touch screen, line in recording, wide screen. 
Cons:. Bundled s/w Picture Package needs a lot of improvement, the View finder is not tiltable like other models. 
Summary:. I upgraded from my Sony Hi8 to the Sony DCR-DVD403 on 01 April '05 for $750 + s&#38;h. I have been doing a lot of research on the different DVD models available in the market. 403 is the latest of all. Here are some Pros.. 1. Has 3 CCD which means true-to-life color.. 2. The 3 MP picture mode also delivers good pictures. (Though I have a 5 MP digicam, its still handy to know that 403 can take good quality digi pics). 3. The best of all that I like is the way you navigate through the recorded scenes. No more REW and FF's and no more accidental over writing.. 4. Each recording session is stored as individual tracks. What this means is that you have smaller files to edit and manipulate. Which means less time consuming while editing.. 5. The touch screen is another feature that I like. No messy buttons on the body like other models.. 6. Watching video in wide screen looks good. Its compatible with normal TVs as well.. 7. The line-in recording is super. I can convert any movie to a DVD.. 8. It operates good in low light.. Now lets come to some cons.. 1. The view finder, is always straight. I would have appreciated if it can be tilted up and down like other Sony Camcorders.. 2. Mini DVD media is expensive. I work around this by having a few DVD-RWs.. 3. The provided software, Picture Package, is a YUK. I never like it. You can use PP to only burn a MiniDVD on your camcorder. It cannot burn on my external DVD burner. Why would you wan to burn a MiniDVD? But one good thing about that is that the sound can be converted from 5.1 CH dolby to the normal 2 layer stereo. If you ask me why you want to do that, the answer is, if you want to use the MPEG with 5.1 CH Dolby on your other video editing s/w's like Photo Studio etc., you will not hear the sound. You need to convert the audio before using other s/w. I currently use PIXELA Image Mixer (This is provided for other older Sony DVD models) and its able to recodnize the 5.1 CH sound. DVD encoding is also excellent in that software. If you can get a copy of that, then you need not use Picture Package at all.. Overall, The best DVD camcorder in market..

Pros:. Specs, touch screen, ease of use, speed, video quality. 
Cons:. Some ergonomic issues. 
Summary:. After extensive research, I chose the DVD403 and received it yesterday.. First the bad: the power switch is difficult to manage with the tiny safety button. Secondly, the photo button is slightly hard to reach with your index finger for which it is designed. Lastly, the zoom toggle is a bit flimsy and hard to regulate for slower zooms.. The good: I've read in numerous places that DVD camcorders don't measure up to MiniDV camcorders. I took a leap with the DVD403 having not seen it in person nor read an editorial review about it. The specs are stellar, especially the 1/3 inch CCD (same as the highly regarded DCR-PC350. The startup time for recording when using a DVD-R is nearly instantaneous. (This has been a big issue with previous DVD CCs). The unit feels weighty and very solid overall. Videos taken in normal indoor lighting conditions were of high quality. The touch screen is wonderful: It's intuitive and easy to use.. I was impressed by the Panasonic 3 CCD models, but my bottom line was the DVD format and the DVD403's 1/3 inch CCD that should give comparable video quality. I think MiniDV is a thing of the past. Although I've only had it one day, my first impression is extremely positive. Hope this helps..

Pros:. High resolution, Ease of use, Touch panel LCD. 
Cons:. Mediocore software. 
Summary:. I owned Mini DV camcorder for more than 5 years. Recently I decided to upgrade to DVD camcorder. After some extensive research, i decided to buy Sony DCR-DVD 403. It supports DVD +/- RW formats giving users wider selection for recording, though I couldnt find mini DVD+RWs yet from Sony. If you are looking for camcorders that can replace your digital camera, this is the one. It has 3M resolution, built in flash, night shot, and more importantly touch panel LCD. I really like the touch panel LCD in this camcorder. It is very easy to use. NP70 has good battery life (more than 2 hrs). You can also choose between 4:3 &#38; 16:9 recording and display formats. Overll this camcorder is worth the price.. The picture package software supplied with the camcorder needs lot of improvement. It is below average for this kind of camcorder. More optical zoom also would have made this camcorder a must have..

Pros:. It works, good quality. 
Cons:. No Mac support. 
Summary:. would of been a 10 had it had MAC support.

Pros:. portability. 
Cons:. not sure yet. 
Summary:. Wanted to know if my Toshiba SD-V391 DVD player is compatible with the -+R and RW discs before purchasing the Sony camcorder. The opinions here are overwhealmingly pro for the kind of point and shoot simplicity I'm looking for. Thanks in advance.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great little size with excellent macro focus ability. Nice user controls including white balance. 
Cons:. Color saturation not as good as my more expensive 3-chip camera.. 
Summary:. I bought this little camera to take to Italy. It is nice and small and the video quality is pretty good. The ability to zoom in tight and focus on just about anything is a plus. I like the touch screen to access features. You can even zoom and record from little buttons on the touch screeen. The steady-shot is the best I've see, no shaking even when zoomed in close. When using the wide format the image isn't that sharp, however, so I'll be using the standard 4 by 3 setting. My other camera, which is too big to take on the road, is the Panasonic AG-DVC30, which is quite nice, too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Light. Great video. Love the touch screen. 
Cons:. Slow startup. That stupid strap. A book for instructions. 
Summary:. I just got the camera about a week ago and I love the DVD feature. Easy to upload into your computer and then edit. Make sure you get a three pack of DVD -RW or DVD +RW so you can reuse. The touch screen is easy to navigate and use. I did not find any problems finding what I needed.. Now here is the bad. Most are minor but it is enough to make me say...could you not have though of a better way?. 1. If you do not by Sony DVDs a message pops up stating "Sony DVD Reccommended". Why do I need to see this...yes non-sony DVDs work and are cheaper.. 2. The strap does get annoying opening and closing the camera. 3. The manual is huge! It takes about an hour to get through....then you have to go back and reference again.. 4. The software sucks....a waste of money.. 5. It takes a moment to scan the DVD and identify what type it is. So do not expect to pop it in and get that unexpected opportunity.. 

$$;
Pros:. unlimited storage on $1.50 1.4gig DVDs for quality stills. 
Cons:. touch screen manual focus a bomb for macros, wipes out disks sometimes. 
Summary:. I replaced a sony PC-10 mini-DV camcorder, that stored 1000 highest quality but low res digital stills on one mini-dv tape. It was inconvenient to transfer these to PC, involved running tape in play for an hour using only sony software. automatic mode didn't work if videos intermixed.. Good news: this new camera means you just pop the dvd disk into your PC after finalizing (a word on that later) and copy the stills to your hard drive. at highest res, 3 megapixels, you can fit 900-1000 at highest quality on one 3" dvd-r disk, or 30 minutes of video or any mix there-of. I used dvd-r's from a stack of 20 for $29 from fry's and they worked fine even tho not 'video quality'. I was doing mostly stills tho. For video I'd get video rated ones, both speed rated and hard coating on them to avoid scratches.. Finalizing: I had used this for 3 months and then one time during finalizing it gave me 'C:13:02' error on screen. then several times more in a row. This essentially means you're hosed. You can try downloading the 'isobuster' utility on the web (isobuster.com I think) and possibly recover the files (possibly, not always possible).. What causes this? either a defective disk or dirt inside the case on the disk. Prevention? use air can and dust brush, look carefully inside dvd compartment when empty, get every spec of fiber or dust out. make sure DVDs don't have any dust or smudges on them. use a lens cleaning cloth dampened with cleaning fluid. and yes, the DVD can have defects. helpfully, if they DO have defects, it tends to be visible on the write side. If you can't brush off something on write side, use another disk.. I got a brand new memorex disk, video quality and it had MAJOR visible defect. Unhappily I didn't look at disk till it had hosed a day's worth of shooting on a hike. I opened the next disk in the package and it had defect too, brand new! I even got into odd situation where one hosed disk plays on the camera but will not copy to dvd either directly or with picture perfect. and using one RW, copying directly gave me 71 pics but using picture perfect copy gave me all my pix, 276. For archival shoots where you will do alot of shooting in a day or two, use dvd-r. for alot of start-stop shooting, switch to dvd-rw, or even better, dvd+rw (+rw does NOT need to be finalized, so I'm guessing will have much less problem being wiped out as you should still be able to copy to that point to your PC). These can't be found locally but are shipped quickly from amazon or two amazon vendors.. Pick up 2 extra of the larger battery and you can shoot for 8 hours straight! battery barn is reliable. very nice to have this much reserve as I do long shoots. pick up a 30mm clear / uv filter to protect the video lens when open, even tho it has snap shut cover when off. get a 30mm lens cap at local camera store for on top of this, plus a leash so you don't drop it.. zoom: this is a problem. It zooms 120x (10 optical + digital) in video mode but unlike pc-10 only 10x (optical). I don't very much want to shoot stills over 10x but sometimes I do and I'm ticked off they did this. I also use it as a spotting scope and this means I have to switch to video mode to zoom in on an animal up a hill in their enclosure at the zoo.. They also TURNED OFF image stabilization in still mode. this is VERY BAD. the stills are great on this camera but NOT if you are having any kind of slight vibration. The monorail around sd animal park destroyed stills I used to get good quality on with old sony cam. you MUST use video to avoid this which means low res to get stills out of video.. Macros: this cam follows sony's great specs allowing macro in to 1cm from an object. it even focuses automatically much of the time. when it doesn't the old sony had an 'infinite focus ring' around lens which you activated with one finger of hand holding cam. this allowed quickly adjusting focus and getting close shots quickly of that tiny flower, etc.. Not so with this camera: you have to take 2nd hand, select menu on touch screen, scroll down, select focus (or spot focus) and touch + / - till in focus. Problem: you have to back off from screen to touch it so hard to look in screen and touch at same time; net result: takes 10 times as long to do what used to be a quick manual focus.. Flash: flash works good till you are closer than about a foot. then it over-exposes the frame. put it on red-eye to force flash anytime you want one and then off; automatic flash is sporadic on when it turns on. The optional 3w video light is nice accessory. For macros in dark areas, get an led light or the sony self powered video light. unlike flashlight which show rings in light pattern, the video light can be held separately from camera and moved in or out to throw an even circle of light covering what you want or lighting up that small object for macro. Inside? turn on flash for just about everything, will bring out colors incredibly for indoor shoots, unless too close to object.. Copying movies to HD: you can just copy them, they are in '.vob' or dvd file format. you need a player that will play these, the cd-rom with the cam has one. use their 'picture perfect' software to copy the same videos over to HD as .mpeg files. Seems they don't play on the PC I didn't install 'picture perfect' software on tho, some codec missing, will have to call sony about this, don't want to place on web then not have people able to view them.. All-in-all it's a good camera, and currently the only dvd-camcorder with hi-res stills far as I know. They goofed on a few things. Hopefully next model will fix these.. these cheap DVDs are way better than buying the 7 - 1.5 gig memory sticks I would have needed to shoot pix on my vacation without a way to upload and re-use a mem stick.. you can see examples of flower composites I made using the new camera, on our club website: www.rth.org/occss then select newsletter composites page. All the pix from 2005-07-04 CSSA show on are using this (previous ones are with PC-10). buying it: prices vary from 800 to 1000; don't get scammed, check out resellerratings.com, type in website of who you might buy it from, I avoided some scam sites that never ship product this way. I'd check their opinion of all your online purchase sites here. epinions has user reviews of products, fun to read.. also check out sony's website and look up this camera if you buy it. has manal as PDF, good to have and has diagram explaining various types of dvd-r, -rw, +rw disks and modes.. Anyway, thanks, sony for a good but not perfect product.. 

$$;
Pros:. very easy to use, awesome quality recording outside, still pretty good quality inside. 
Cons:. only 20 min recording on the best setting, zoom very sensitiv, viewfinder doesnt move, on off button flimsy, no extra memory card for pictures. 
Summary:. we thought a long while if we should take the sony dvd403 or the panasonic gs400 - they are just so different. to be honest i am not sure if we bought the right one (cant compare because we dont have the other one) but i am very happy with the sony. i am the mother of an 18 month old daughter and we are expecting our second child in April. We just wanted something very easy to use (mostly point and shot), with good quality not only outside but also inside. i love the fact i can just start it and its ready to go - no finding the right spot on the tape. 20 min isnt a long time but so far we only had time to switch out the dvds .... i was afraid because i read i couldnt edit it, even the guy at best buy told us there is no way.... well my hubby told me not to worry and he was right, it is not much editing i want to do, delete a few scenes, change order, brighten it up a little, maybe some music in the background or some titles - and he was right it works. though mostly i make straight copies and send them to the family and inlaws, who all enjoy it very much to see our girl growing up.. as i mentioned there are things sony should improve (cons) and probably will all in all two thumbs up!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, lots of options - but also can use automatic settings easily. 
Cons:. darklight setting greens screens and picture even when in sufficient light if switch on accidently. 
Summary:. Overall I found the camera very easy to use, Image stabilization and automatic settings make it simple for our kids to use. Lightweight,but packed with options. 

$$;
Pros:. Sony quality, 5.1 microphone, easy to use, all the usual Sony camcorder extras (nightshot, steadycam, infolithium battery, etc), touchscreen menu, widescreen lcd and recording. 
Cons:. bulky, recording quality w/some artifacts, humming of the internal motors gets picked up by the microphone (especially when zooming), slow powerup. 
Summary:. it's a great camcorder unless you're looking for ultra high quality video. very simple to use/user friendly, especially with the touchscreen. people with big fingers might have trouble with the touchscreen. features galore as you would expect from Sony. highly recommended for casual home videos. have not had a chance yet to upload to computer and edit/reproduce dvds. i've only hooked up the camcorder to a tv or played the disc directly on a dvd player. sometimes has trouble focusing in lower lighting conditions.. 

$$;
Pros:. They are really thinking. 
Cons:. 3 inch dvd formatt is limited. 
Summary:. I recently purchased this camera at best buy. When I was using it I wasnt aware that you can only get 20 minutes of video. I use 20 minutes just warming up. When I switch to long play it gave me 60 minutes but the video was horrible. I had to take it back. Why could they have given us a mpeg 4 mode so we can shout 4 hours onto a dvd. 20 minutes for $12 each dvd is a not a wise investment. Steve. 

$$;
Pros:. great video quality, still shots convenient, play finalized disks in any DVD player. 
Cons:. 20 minutes on highest quality.. 
Summary:. When I first bought this camcorder I was extremely pleased with it in all areas. Absolutely beautiful video quality on highest quality. Great stillshots. Easy to use. The convenience of playing the disks in a commercial DVD player without having to use DVD authoring software to render it to DVD format was great. Then, 5 months after I bought, it broke down and they charged me $149 to have it repaired. (Only a 3-month warrantee? That stinks!) It worked for awhile after the repair, now the shutter will only open part way and it's useless. I have read that this has happened to other DVDE403 owners, as well, so it appears to be a major flaw. Though the price has dropped significantly since I bought it,it cost me $850. There's no excuse for having to sink another $300 for repairs into it within such a short time of buying it. The warranty stinks!. Unfortunately, it's highly unlikely that I will buy another Sony camcorder, which is really too bad because my previous Sony 8mm lasted 10-15 years. That's why I went with Sony again. No more.. 

$$;
Pros:. quality,ease of use,good resolution and zoom. 
Cons:. unless you want to keep a storehouse of small dvd's you need to purchase an online after market soft ware that is extremely time consuming and not real user friendly to convert dvd's.. 
Summary:. ok it's a quality camera but the disconcerting part is that the editing software is not available from sony and they are tight-lipped about recommending one. Not the camera that the average individual would want to buy. You dont find this out until you have purchased the camera and want to convert the videos. Sony should be ashamed. Camera is good, everything else is flawed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to operate and very good recording. 
Cons:. Shutter broke in less than 2 years. 
Summary:. I used to have lot faith in Sony products but this DCR-DVD403 changed my opinion. I bought this about 2 years ago, might have used about 20 times so far. The shutter doesn't open anymore and sony is charging $307 flat fee to fix it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video Quatlity and great lense for pictures. 
Cons:. DVD burner is really weak.. 
Summary:. I have to start by saying that I had the DCR-DVD103 and had no problems with the DVD burner. I read the reviews about the improved quatlity of the DCR-DVD403 so I up graded. The picture quality is great. I found that the DCR-DVD103 would sometimes give me bad video. The DCR-DVD403 gives me much better video even in bad light situations. Furthermore I love that fact that we can take pictures and videos and record them on the same medium.. So why the 4 rating?. I would give this camcorder a 9 out of 10 if I could get the DVDs to play in my DVD player. Out of three discs DVD-R I could only read one in my new laptop and none in my entertainment center DVD player. All disc created with the DCR-DVD103 were readable everywhere. I have tried different brands hoping this would do it, but that did not work. Has anyone else experienced this? If so this should be noted to the public as not an isolated incedent of bad hardware.. 

$$;
Pros:. low-light performance, LCD, battery life. 
Cons:. only 20 minutes of HQ per disk, mediocre HQ quality. 
Summary:. Test drove one of these while deciding which camcorder to get. Video quality is acceptable, but not outstanding even in HQ mode. The camera is quite easy to use, and has a very good battery life.. A recurring irritation is the disk full condition. The 20 minute limit on HQ video is OK for short events or a series of brief clips. However, it means that longer sessions are awkward, and I found I was defensively swapping disks at the start of each multi-minute clip, just to ensure that recording was not cut off prematurely.. The miniDVD issues persuaded me to get a DV camcorder. The one I got was the Panasonic GS250, which is not as good as the Sony in low light, but is equal or slightly better in just about everything else (especially video sharpness and color). It can also record 60 minutes of HQ on a tape, from a single battery charge.. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing good about this. 
Cons:. very bad product. 

$$;
Pros:. good video quality. 
Cons:. support is a nightmare and no software support is available. 
Summary:. The software CD is dead out of box. Sony can not supply me the good softwere two months after I reported the problem. There is no place to download the software and there is no email support.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a compact camcorder...but it doesn't makeit worth it.. 
Cons:. I was EXTREMELY CAREFUL, but it broke after I used it 3-4 times. Best Buy was awful to work with and Sony wanted me to pay them for the problem.. 
Summary:. I warn against making purchases with Besy Buy (don't believe me? Research what the Wall Street Journal has said about thier money making tactics). I have been a returning customer and spent a lot a money there over the years, but when it comes to a problem forget it! They had no intention of helping, neither did Sony unless I paid to fix it, well thats a novel idea! They said they never get the complaint I have and it would cost over $140 in labor to fix. Keep in mind this is only a few months old. I refused to pay for this problem considering the condition I have kept it in. I would love to say that I had a better experience, but I would look into an older model (the problems won't be new and they will know if they work, because of suckers like me!) and different brand...that's what BEST BUY told me AFTER I bought it!!! Anyone looking for a nice looking camcorder with a lense that doesn't open?!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. LCD touchscreen is not bad. 
Cons:. Shutter/Lense is defective and breaks after several months. 
Summary:. I just bought this camcorder about 5 months ago and the shutter doesn't open. It makes this noise like it's stuck when I turn it on. I also noticed that I can't see through the view finder but the LCD is on and operable If I manually open the shutter (I used scotch tape to keep the shutter open to see if it would work). I see that's there's another user who came across the same problem. This is a major defect by Sony. The labor warranty is past due (90 days) which probably means I will have to pay at least $149 to get this fixed. I paid big bucks for this camcorder and didn't expect something like this to happen, especially so soon. I've only used this camcorder about 20 times since I bought it..
