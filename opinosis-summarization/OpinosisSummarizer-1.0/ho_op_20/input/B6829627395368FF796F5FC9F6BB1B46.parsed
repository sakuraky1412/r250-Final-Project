i/LS booked/VBD some/DT flights/NNS to/TO gothenburg/NN for/IN a/DT quick/JJ city/NN break/NN ,/, only/RB realising/VBG after/IN i/FW 'd/MD booked/VBN that/IN it/PRP was/VBD the/DT weekend/NN of/IN the/DT gothenburg/NN half-marathon/NN and/CC hotels/NNS were/VBD pretty/RB much/RB sold/VBN out/RP in/IN the/DT centre/NN ./.

i/FW booked/VBN this/DT place/NN through/IN hostelworld/NN ,/, as/IN it/PRP seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB easily/RB accessible/JJ from/IN the/DT centre/NN by/IN tram/NN and/CC was/VBD also/RB close/JJ to/TO the/DT docks/VBZ area/NN on/IN the/DT north/JJ side/NN of/IN the/DT river/NN which/WDT is/VBZ being/VBG regenerated/VBN ./.

i/LS stopped/VBD for/IN a/DT bite/NN to/TO eat/VB near/IN the/DT hotel/NN ,/, so/RB actually/RB arrived/VBN there/RB just/RB after/IN 12/CD pm/NN hoping/VBG to/TO leave/VB my/PRP$ bag/NN and/CC come/VB back/RB to/TO check-in/NN later/RB ./.

i/LS looked/VBD at/IN the/DT directions/NNS from/IN the/DT hotel/NN website/NN detailing/VBG the/DT tram/NN numbers/NNS that/WDT go/VBP past/IN their/PRP$ stop/NN and/CC noticed/VBD it/PRP was/VBD n't/RB actually/RB that/IN far/RB so/RB decided/VBN to/TO walk/VB as/IN it/PRP was/VBD lovely/JJ weather/NN ./.

it/PRP took/VBD me/PRP about/IN 25/CD minutes/NNS to/TO walk/VB over/IN the/DT bridge/NN and/CC get/VB to/TO the/DT hotel/NN ,/, good/JJ to/TO know/VB if/IN i/FW got/VBD stuck/VBN out/RP in/IN town/NN late/RB at/IN night/NN ./.

the/DT room/NN was/VBD quite/RB compact/JJ and/CC was/VBD a/DT corner/NN room/NN which/WDT meant/VBD it/PRP had/VBD plenty/NN of/IN light/NN but/CC as/IN you/PRP 're/VBP on/IN the/DT ground/NN floor/NN people/NNS walking/VBG past/NN can/MD see/VB right/JJ inside/NN ./.

there/EX is/VBZ free/JJ wi-fi/NNS throughout/IN the/DT hotel/NN ,/, and/CC i/FW had/VBD no/DT problems/NNS with/IN it/PRP and/CC the/DT speed/NN was/VBD good/JJ ./.

overall/JJ i/FW 'd/MD have/VB no/DT problem/NN staying/VBG here/RB again/RB ,/, a/DT good/JJ value/NN choice/NN and/CC not/RB too/RB far/RB from/IN the/DT centre/NN ./.

i/LS could/MD only/RB get/VB an/DT `/`` economy/NN '/'' room/NN which/WDT meant/VBD i/FW did/VBD n't/RB have/VB an/DT en-suite/JJ bathroom/NN and/CC had/VBD to/TO walk/VB down/IN the/DT corridor/NN to/TO use/VB the/DT showers/NNS ./.

the/DT tea/coffee/NN machine/NN is/VBZ on/IN throughout/IN the/DT day/NN ,/, so/RB you/PRP can/MD go/VB in/IN and/CC help/VB yourself/PRP whenever/WRB you/PRP want/VBP ./.

the/DT shower/NN rooms/NNS were/VBD a/DT walk/NN down/IN the/DT corridor/NN ,/, and/CC there/EX are/VBP 6/CD separate/JJ showers/NNS and/CC all/DT were/VBD kept/VBN nice/JJ and/CC clean/JJ in/IN the/DT busy/JJ times/NNS in/IN the/DT mornings/NNS ./.

although/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ a/DT hostel/hotel/NN the/DT interior/JJ decor/NN is/VBZ fine/JJ -LRB-/-LRB- and/CC currently/RB being/VBG refreshed/VBN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC it/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB have/VB a/DT cheap/JJ feel/NN ./.

this/DT means/VBZ you/PRP keep/VB the/DT curtains/NNS closed/VBD ,/, although/IN they/PRP 're/VBP quite/RB thin/JJ so/IN it/PRP 's/VBZ still/RB quite/RB light/JJ inside/IN ./.

i/LS had/VBD an/DT early/JJ flight/NN from/IN london/NNP ,/, so/RB arrived/VBD into/IN the/DT central/JJ station/NN area/NN by/IN 10/CD am/RB ./.

staff/NN were/VBD helpful/JJ and/CC gave/VBD me/PRP a/DT good/JJ basic/JJ plan/NN of/IN things/NNS to/TO see/VB for/IN a/DT first/JJ timer/NN in/IN gothenburg/NN ./.
