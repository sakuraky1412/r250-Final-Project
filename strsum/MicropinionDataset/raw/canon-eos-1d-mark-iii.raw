$$;
Pros:. Image quality, speed, AF, massive battery capacity, sheer feeling of quality.. 
Cons:. Higher res LCD would be nice but no big deal.. 
Summary:. I've used this for nature and sports photography for 18 mths and its been superb. I've fortunately never had any major AF problems though Canon's recalibration of the outer AF points in early 2009 has resulted in even better AI servo performance. Now easily the best AF I've used (better than 1DIIn).. 

$$;
Pros:. It's been improved!. 
Cons:. It is a complex professional tool and amatures beware.. 
Summary:. I rented a 1D Mark IIIfor a weekend as I plan on buying a new professional body soon. I have read many of the criticisms of the autofocus and I purposely waited to see what Canon would do about them. The updated model I got performed flawlessly. I had no problems with the autofocus in bright sunlight or lowlight conditions. As for the flawed cameras, I never got a chance to see the problems other than those that were shown on the websites. Ordinarily and after such a test I would buy this camera and still may do so, however, there will soon be an announcement of its replacement (within 60 days).. Don't ask how I know. Let's just say the rumors are close to the truth. Even still this is a formitable machine and worthy of its ratings by Cnet. (and no, I don't work for them or Canon.). 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, tough, incredible image quality. 
Cons:. Not for amateurs.. 
Summary:. The focus issue (which was minor) is now fixed, so ignore all those reviews from people who've never even seen one of these cameras.. Sorry Nikon, but Canon still has a lead in the Pro DSLR segment. Specs don't show how truly superior the 1D-MK3 (and the 1Ds-MK3) are to the Nikon D3, but experienced shooters who've used both will see that the Canon's Image Quality is higher, despite a slightly lower pixel count. The 1DMK3 performs at top speed with all features active, the Nikon D3 cheats to achieve full speed.. The most visible difference is seen in the quality of the final image. The 1DMK3 is sharper at every ISO, with noise just as well controlled. Highlight Tone Priority gives the 1DMK3 a 1-stop advantage in dynamic range... that's a big deal.. Most pros are bound by their collection of lenses. The 1DMK3 from Canon gives Canon shooters reason to be happy, they continue to have the world's best DSLR series to go with the world's larges and best collection of lenses.. 

$$;
Pros:. New 3" veiw screen, And increase in control. 
Cons:. Price is high. 
Summary:. Anyone who wants to shoot with One of the best cameras, And get the best resulted, will be happy with this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, 14bit raw, ease of use, Live view for Man. Focus. 
Cons:. Price (would have been nice to see a reduction). 
Summary:. Blindingly fast, clean shots, same of better keeper rates that my 1DIIn (lots better than 20D or 5D for sports).. Love the Live View for helping focus manual focus lenses, along with the 10x zoom make the Zeiss lenses easy to use.. Ability to 'fine tune' focus on individual lenses for focus saves $250 a body and $130 a lens paying Canon to match them!!!. Using Exposure Bracketing +-2EV, high speed drive (10fps) and setting drive limit to 3 consecutive shots makes taking bracketted shots to be converted to HDR (either Photoshop or Photomatix) a breeeze.. 

$$;
Pros:. IQ QULIITY BIUILD QUILTY AND AUTO FOCUES. 
Cons:. ONLY 24 HR IN A DAY TO USE IT. 
Summary:. I put about 700 images on it every 3-4 days and this camera rocks. I looked into this camera a lot before i got and was up and down on it. I then i got and love it. I am sure there are people out there that have had problems with it but for me so far so great. I have had eos 1 cameras before but not like this one. The AF is super fast.The IQ is sweet and the hole thing is built like a tank.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image Quality, Speed, AutoFocus, Custom Settings &#38; Profiles. 
Cons:. Definately Not The AutoFocus - Other Reviewer May Not Understand the Autofocus.. 
Summary:. We purchased this camera for an in-house digital photo studio. We used to use a simple Rebel XT. For catalog quality printing across 300 manufacturers and hundreds of thousands of parts, this camera turned our mediocre studio into a powerhouse. The other reviewer who gave a 3 out of 10 for the autofocus failed to evaluate the camera in its' entirety. The autofocus can be as useful and "automatic" as you want or as manual as one would prefer. If I would be forced to provide a "con" or maybe an item I would see improvement, I would have to say that this camera is not your average "point-n-shoot" product. This is a professional camera with more customizations and settings than any competitor camera. With that, once the learning curve is transversed, the camera is the ultimate machine.. If you have the means, buy it. I am sure it will not disapoint.. We use it to snap the photo in a studio and wirelessly write the image to a server share, as the photos are taken, marketing production staff is grabbing the images, clipping and saving within our DAM for further production.. This camera is the ultimate photo machine.. Enjoy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Per Pixel Detail is superb with L glass. Fast auto focusing even in low light conditions. Very good dynamic range and color rendition.. 
Cons:. Negative press it received for focusing problems. The Sub-Mirror issue seemed to only effect a certain batch of cameras. Mine is flawless.. 
Summary:. The image quality is simply superb. Don?t let the pixel count fool you. I printed 13x19?s that rival and even surpass the printouts from higher pixel count Pro SLR?s. Dynamic range and colors are also excellent. I am not experiencing any of the auto focus problems that were apparently an issue with this model. In my experience, my 1D out performs even my Nikon D3 in terms of auto-focus tracking especially in low light situations. I happen to shoot both the Nikon and Canon systems. I purchased the Canon 85L f1/2 and recently completed a portrait session with this combination. The results were nothing short of amazing. Incredibly sharp where needed with beautiful colors. I highly recommend this model but it is not a camera for the novice photographer. Unfortunately, all the talk about the auto-focus issues has over-shadowed this truly amazing camera. Once you mastered the technical aspects of the 1D Mark 3 and combining your photography skills, providing that you have some, I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with the final printouts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fastest AutoFocus System Available, Low Noise, Extremely Configurable. 
Cons:. Absolutely None. 
Summary:. After owning the Canon 1D Mark2, I decided to give the Nikon D3 a try. It was a nice camera except for one huge problem... It couldn't focus well in low/medium light.. So, I took back the D3 and got the 1D Mark III. BEST MOVE I EVER MADE! This camera focuses better in low light than the D3 and Mark2 combined! The noise at high ISO's is almost as good as the D3 (but what good is clean ISO from the D3 if it can't focus in low light). Additionally Rob Galbraith reviews this camera and states that the 1D Mark III produces THE best images of any camaera at ISO100 - 1600, that includes the D3 and 1DS Mark III.. By far, the best indoor sports camera you can buy is the 1D Mark III. Most of the people on here giving it low scores either don't own one, or had the old pre-blue dot cameras.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast AF (even in low light) and High ISO images are real clean.. 
Cons:. No UDMA R/W like the Nikon D3 and D300. 
Summary:. If you are thinking about this camera the old bodies did have an issue (i had one of them) i bought new another body a few weeks ago and bottom line IT WORKS! I did have to micro adjust some of my Lens, but i had Canon do for free since i spent so much money on body and lens.. 

$$;
Pros:. Customization for individual needs, easy menu, superb low light shots, great action shots. 
Cons:. weight, complicated AF at first. 
Summary:. The initial mirror problems are fixed. This is a superb camera IF one takes the time to learn to set the AF features to match the specific photography needs. I use AI Servo, so I had to go through the AF menu and set it up to my needs.. After customizing the AF and always working in manual mode, the camera captures fantastic shots.. This is not a beginners' point and shoot camera. It is a Pro camera that has to be fine tuned. If you fine tune it, you will be rewarded.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Image Quality (even at high ISO), 10 FPS shooting, Extensive Custom Function Menus. 
Cons:. Pretty complex for the less experienced. 
Summary:. Afer reading some of the negative reviews on this site, I'm wondering how many people have really used this camera extensively and really understand the auto-focus complexities. I have owned this camera since July 2007, and have made over 6000 images with it since then, including over 3000 in warm weather in Kenya in August, and well over 1000 recently in cold weather in Bosque del Apache in New Mexico. The performance has been superb, all in all, considering the high demands I placed on it for photographing high speed chases (Cheetahs) and high speed flight (birds flyng directly toward the camera for landing at close range). Canon released a service advisory for an auto focus problem due to a sub-mirror assembly problem in some (but not all) Mark III's, and my serial number was among those listed as probably having the problem. I was too busy to send it in for repair until after I returned from Bosque, but I was very pleased with all the great images I brought back from Africa as well as Bosque. I recently purchased a Canon 40D as well, and flight shots at Bosque with both cameras showed a higher percentage of perfect focus with the Mark III than with the 40D. By the way, I finally sent the Mark III off for repair two weeks ago on a Friday, and had it back in my hands the following Friday, with an extended warranty of a year from the repair date (on the whole camera, not just the repair).. There are custom functions that affect auto-focus performance on this camera that simply do not exist on other cameras, including the 40D, so that adds to complexity and the possiblity that the camera may not be set up optimally for the kind of shooting you are doing. However, once you have it set up properly, I believe you will be struck by some of the awesome images you can make. I know a number of professional photographers who are shooting with this camera almost exclusively, and I'll always choose it over the 40D for the most difficult shooting situations.. By the way, I have a leopard image from Kenya made after sunset at ISO 3200, 1/60 second, that is virtually noiseless. My 40D at the same shooting conditions in Bosque couldn't come close, with a fair amount of shadow noise present.. 

$$;
Pros:. speed, ease of use, excellent new software interface, live view. 
Cons:. autofocus issue even after upgrading to 1.1.0. 
Summary:. Autofocus needs further adjustment by canon, It's predecessor, a 5D, produced much sharper images.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture quality when the focus works. 
Cons:. Autofocus is a mess and canon does not appear to be taking the issue seriously. 
Summary:. Given the demonstrated issues with the 1D Mark III's autofocus, CNET should seriously reconsider its Editors Choice Award and its 9.3 Spectacular rating. Such a rating is not merited for a camera that fails to accomplish its primary task competently (a sports camera that can't focus in broad daylight?). Additionally, more and more people are moving up from compact digital cameras to digital SLR's. Given that technology from the 1 series will trickle down to the lower end Canon SLR's expected to be announced in near future, it is incumbent upon a review site such as CNET to put the camera through its paces to see if it lives up the manufacturer's promises. If the autofocus issue continues to occur in the expected 40D and 5D II, many CNET users will be ripped off by Canon.

$$;
Pros:. Decent resolution. 
Cons:. Banding on any subtle gradation.. 
Summary:. This camera is a top digital contender, even though its feel in the hands is quite amateurish. That said, the Nikon D2Xs will outshoot it every time. Why? Unacceptable banding in continuous tone gradations. I shot with this Canon, and had to rely on the old prepress trick of "adding noise" to correct banding in smooth gradations to fix an ugly problem found in shots with a continuous color which grades from light to darker tones over a large portion of the image. The image was of a human, not some odd object which might mess with the sensor. The banding was prominent enough to make me yearn for Kodachrome and a good drum scan.. The same sort of image shot on the competitive Nikon D2Xs does not display this issue. That's why I opted to buy the Nikon. I'm waiting to test the D3X with its 25+ megapixels and full frame sensor like the Canon, as I'm curious to know if the banding issue is a function of sensor size and overal pixel density.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good features. 
Cons:. Super camera. 
Summary:. Updated. on Oct 21, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. 10 on the pictures where autofocus works. 
Cons:. 1 where it doesn't. 
Summary:. the fact that Canon has produced 10+ versions of firmware for their camera says something of the autofocus problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality and dynamic range. 
Cons:. Focus my G5 focusses better. 
Summary:. This has been a bitter disappointment for me, having left Nikon 6 years ago Ive been thrilled with the Canon products, particularly the 1D series, it showed how a camera should work, Nikon had nothing like it until the D3.. Coming from a long line of 1D, 1D firmware update, 2x 1D MKII and those firmware updates a to 2x MKIIn I was not going to be so easily impressed but was looking forward to the better low light AF, bringing it on par with Nikon for the first time EVER and the increasing the sensitivity to �2.8 again matching Nikon and increasing low light sensitive to -1 to where Nikon had been all along, this along with the improved servo AF was finally a machine that truly had everything.. But if it cant focus, its sadly not worth the ink on the box. Canon are recalling the camera from the dealers, but I as someone who paid top dollar will have to send it in, at my own expense, I cant even return it to my dealer, Im so mad. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast at 10fps this thing captures like a movie camera a 10Mp movie camera .... 
Cons:. Auto Focus has major design flaw and until canon fixes it WAIT!. 
Summary:. This camera had great potential but Auto Focus issues make it hard to pay the bills with shots that are out of focus.. 

$$;
Pros:. umm......???. 
Cons:. Auto focus auto focus auto focus. 
Summary:. Well as you know this camera has an awful auto focusing problem.... Skip this, head for the excellent full fram Nikon D3.. Enough said. 

$$;
Pros:. Great at room temperature or cooler. 
Cons:. Has trouble focusing in warm weather.. 
Summary:. Probably Canon's biggest blunder the past decade. Great Pro camera with a design flaw that misfocuses in warm weather - not good for a sports camera. On the up side you should be able to find one cheap on the used market if you live in cool climate. CNET should revise their rating..

$$;
Pros:. Great if you find one that can focus. 
Cons:. Many of these cameras have horrendous focusing problems. I purchased 5 of them and 3 had serious focusing issues. Even after upgrades, and a voluntary recall/repair by Canon.. 
Summary:. This camera is terrible. My worst one has been to Canon factory repair 5 times. The thing just does not focus. I would not recommend purchasing a Canon MKIII camera. I am actually surprised Canon was not sued for making such a sub-par product. I shoot sports and news and need my equipment to operate properly, always.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have 3 of them for sale.. 
Cons:. You will be sending back and forth to canon repair for AUTO FOCUS issues. I would NOT recommend this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. If it cant focus then their are no pros. 
Cons:. Unrepairable auto focus,. 
Summary:. Firmware after firmware the autofocus does not work acurately. Ask any Canon professional photographer and they will tell you to stay away from this model. Wake up Cnet, what an embarrassment. The highest rated product of 2007 and it does not focus properly. Cnet lacks integrity, reliability, and knowledge. I dont know why I bother with Cnet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sensor precisely captures nuances of light and color. Great high ISO.. 
Cons:. Nuanced light and color will be out of focus. 
Summary:. If you are thinking about purchasing a 1D Mark III, 1Ds Mark III, 40D, Xti or the presumably soon to be announced 5D Mark II, you should think carefully about your decision. Canon is having serious quality control issues with its newest camera. Even worse, Canon wont discuss the issue, cant fix it and appears to have been aware of it before releasing the product.. Including tax, I paid close to $5,000 for the 1D Mark III. It soon became clear that I had made a huge mistake assuming Canon would not sell a flagship camera with a crippled autofocus. If you research this issue you will learn about a photographer named Rob Galbraith who tested a pre production camera and described the autofocus as a mess. Canon told him that the pre production autofocus had limitations and that the issues would be addressed before production. His extensive tests of production cameras, however, determined that Canon had not improved the autofocus. Here is his description of the auto focus:. It can't hold focus on static subjects very well and it can't track moving subjects very well.. Over the months, Rob rigorously tested a total of 9 cameras and all 9 cameras were defective. After publicly ignoring the issue for 7 months, Canon finally admitted that there was a hardware issue that needed to be repaired. Canon, however, claimed that only a minority of cameras needed the repair, a claim that strongly contrasted with Robs 9 out of 9 bad cameras with a wide range of serial numbers acquired over several months.. After the fix acknowledgement, Canon began marking post fix cameras with a blue dot on the box of new cameras. Rob tested the new cameras too. After rigorously testing 2 newly designed post fix cameras SELECTED by Canon Japan and one additional camera with the fix, Rob determined that the cameras were still broken. His tests where supervised by Canon Tokyo and Canon USA and his lenses were calibrated by Canon to rule out lens calibration issues. Believe what you like, but it seems that if Canon cant even find 2 good cameras, its unlikely you will find one.. I feel that Canon has dealt with the issue dishonestly and although I previously loved its products, I am very open to switching brands. Nikon has released several compelling bodies and lenses. If I switch, it will cost me dearly because I own lenses that cost me a several multiples of the cost of the Mark III, but I am seriously looking. Good luck on your decision, youll need it if you choose Canon.. By the way, you will find that people who use either brand are fiercely loyal and will criticize anyone who says anything negative. I could care less. I paid a premium for premium performance and I got a dud. It appears that they are all duds. I would be just as hard on an expensive flat screen, computer or car that could not perform its primary function competently. Canon should be embarrassed by its abject failure to produce a quality product at this price point but it hasnt deigned to address the issue in any meaningful way..
