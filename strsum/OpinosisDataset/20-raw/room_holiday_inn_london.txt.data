Rooms were well insulated from outside noise .
If I had paid more than $100 for my room, I would have been disappointed .
both rooms were kept very clean during our extended visit .
Rooms were cleaned every day without fail and toiletries and coffee sachets etc replenished .
Tiny room, dated furniture, the dirt from my shoes wasn't removed by the cleaners during my stay .
Even standard staterooms aboard cruise ships were the same size or larger !
Rooms are fairly small, but you have to expect this outside of North America .
My bathroom was, like the room, small .
Bathroom was smaller than U .
Our rooms were not ready, we were promised rooms at a later time, etc .
Bathroom is a bit small but acceptable .
Room was clean, comfortable, modern .
Usualy i still smell smoke from somewhere , even on the non, smoking rooms, not this time .
Rooms are clean and good size by English standards .
The bathroom is small, but well equipped .
This is a great hotel, nice rooms, not too big but this is not a problem .
Bathroom was nice with good shower .
Shabby rooms basic facilties ,  no way is this a Four Star hotel .
Room rate including continental breakfast was very competitive .
Room size is fine and bathroom is good .
