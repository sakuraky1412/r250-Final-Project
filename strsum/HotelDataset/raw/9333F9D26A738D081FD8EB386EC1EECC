we stayed here for 3 nights during a trip to thailand .
the hotel is on the east side of the city and is a bit of a walk or ride to the center of town , but honestly it is not that bad .
we walked most days or took a tuk tuk to get around .
the staff were nice and check in was alright , despite the fact that we had to wait an hour in the lobby for our room , despite arriving at 1pm .
the room itself was super basic .
a tv , a large bed that was fairly comfortable and a good sized bathroom .
the room was fairly large , although it was mostly just a big tile floor with a bed in the center .
the temperature was hard to keep even with a wall mounted fan style ac unit , but it worked . . .
eventually .
breakfast was included and it was fine , but certainly nothing special .
some mediocre slices of french toast/pancakes and some noodles , etc , plus standard bread , jam , etc etc .
the hotel was very nearby a delicious cake shop that was like 1 street north called love at first bite ( delicious . . .
the 2 of us ordered 4 slices and wanted more . . .
) .
overall though , the hotel is near the night markets and really , you can walk to most stuff fairly easily , you just have to be willing to walk a little .
we enjoyed chiang mai so walking was not that big a deal , and worst case you can always walk from the hotel to the nearby street and catch a tuk tuk or something .
in the end , the hotel was just fine , and there were not really any major issues , but i am hard pressed to believe it is one of the best hotels the city has to offer .
the price was very good though and as stated , it was clean and serviceable .
if you want luxury accommodations , this is not the place .
if you get a good price and just want a decent , clean place to sleep that has a simple breakfast with pool/wifi included , this is a fine choice .
