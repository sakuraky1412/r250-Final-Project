perfect for taking photos on vacation  .

great quality  .

the zoom is perfect and so is the fast operation  .

also taken video clips upto 20 mins  .

good sound quality  .

although i use the eye piece more than the lcd screen for taking pictures  .

saves on battery life on long day trips  .

but you might need a second smaller camera for casual photos in dinner parties and outdor events where carrying this big camera can be a problem .

love it its a v fine piece  .

this camera is one of the better cameras i have used  .

i knew i wanted a mega    zoom camera but is not interested in the dslr price range  .

definately recommend this camera to anyone  .

bought it at sears with the extended protection on it  .

hopefully i wont have to use it but i read some reviews that suggested it .

i bought the s3 from office max for $399 with a 1gb sandisk ultra ii  .

nothing can come close at the price i paid  .

the lcd is a little small , but i shoot using the evf anyway so its no big deal .

let's be realistic here  .

the opinions and reviews comparing this canon s3 is to the sony h5 , are too much of a mine's better than yours foray as a previous owner of the sony h1 , i is about to gravitate , somewhat automatically to its successor the h2  .

seeing that the h2's lcd display dropped from 2  .

5 to 2 , that put me off  .

i handled the h2 as a preview to purchase but found the whole camera as well as the lcd display to be too small  .

i noticed and rread the review of the h5  .

this i thought would be the camera for me  .

the lcd display is 3 , the sensor at 7  .

2mp were both a boost over the h1  .

i is sold , or so i thought i clicked on a link to a canon s3 is review  .

i read the review , hmmm  .

sounds impressive this s3  .

i investigated the s3 a little more now for most people that usually have 6x4 prints , anything with 3mp or more is adequate  .

so the h5's 7  .

2mp or the h2's and the s3's 6mp is more than sufficient all three of these cameras are magnificent in their capabilities  .

each will produce excellent images  .

sure there may be a minor advantage of one over the other for high iso noise levesl , but hey , we should know that in this price bracket and camera level there will always be a compromise i must prefix much of the following review with the fact that i am and have been a sony fanatic for as long as i can remember  .

it is with some disappointment then that i have to say that i chose the canon s3 above the other two sony models  .

the images i took with the 5mp sony h1 are excellent  .

i expect any of these three cameras to do just as good or maybe slightly better (the 7  .

2mp would be nice) i , like other reviewers here , looked at other cameras before deciding on the s3  .

the choice is not the easiest  .

i contemplated the following (amongst a few others) , sony h2 , h5 , sony r1 , canon 350ds , panasonic fz7 and the canon s3 is as i said before each have their own pros and cons  .

the sony r1 is a great camera however as a fixed lens camera , for me a 5x zoom is not enough if i'm going to carry its 2 plus pounds weight  .

the 10mp and big aps sensor were very compelling features  .

the 350ds almost got my money  .

the optical viewfinder the solid feel , the fast continous capture capability and the interchangeable lenses are superb  .

however the interchangeable lenses were (foe me) also its downfall  .

i have for years prior to owning the sony h1 , been an slr user  .

i sold my whole pentax kit and moved on to an auto pentax slr    oh the convenience of point and shoot after years of lens changing exposure setting etc , etc so (for me) the dslr's are out  .

they are all good    some better than others , but to get the capabities of 12x zoom , the lens cost can easily outweigh the cost of the camera so my choice came down to the sony h5 and the canon s3 is  .

do i want the extra 1  .

2mp and that extra 1 on the lcd display (hmmm  .

i do like that viewfinder)  .

do i want better quality movies with stereo sound , an intervalometer for picture sequences , a twain driver to allow a computer to capture images a really macro macro capability a flexible lcd display and many great and useful camera options  .

well , the larger lcd display is nice but i normally use the evf for taking photo's the lcd display is used for just that , a display , to show images to others of the images taken  .

the canons s3 lcd though smaller , is useful and it can be foded away for screen protection  .

the extra 1  .

2mp is of marginal benefit for most photo's offering only a slight improvement on enlarged images the intevalometer and the twain driver to allow pc control of the s3 is something i find advantageous    though this is not for everybody the ability to take excellent movie clips is something very useful  .

there is of course a limit of 8 minutes at 640x48 at 30fps on a 1gb sd memory but most movie shots are far less than that anyway  .

a thirty second movie clip of the same scene seems a very long scene  .

so for holiday makers and quick home movie scenes this can be a very useful feature so as it turns out , the canon s3 is does it for me  .

this is not so much because it's better than the sony et al , but because it offers the features and 12x zoom convenience that  i  want at a great price bracket on a featture by feature basis after lengthy reviews , i think the s3 has the advantage , but that 3 screen would have been nice regards  .

petetr  .

i initially bought the sd630 last week because i thought i wanted a camera that i could shove into a pocket for the odd funny shot thoughout the course of the day  .

turns out that i'm just not that kind of guy  .

each day's downloads brought a slew of disappointment  .

in all , i ran through some 200 to 250 shots and i knew i wanted more control  .

don't get me wrong , the sd630 is a great camera , it's just that somewhere along the way , my opinion changed about what i considered photograpically (no , i don't know if that's really a word) fun  .

went back to cc to swap it for the s3 today and guess what  .

more fun , clearer pics zoom , zoom , zoom  .

cc's 14 day return policy is great as long as you spend at least what the return price was  .

i plan to spend the next week shooting my surroundings and if this one doesn't cut the mustard than the sony h5 is on deck  .

so far , i do not see any reason to buy into sony's proprietary crap so the s3 is probably it for me .

i currently own the s2 is which i bought as soon as it came out last summer for taking pics on vacations  .

the camera is excellent , offers amazing picture quality , and i found the stabilizer useful  .

the new s3 is adds 1 mp , although this is unnecessary for increased resolution , and the camera is now black instead of silver (possibly to give more resemblance to the higher end rebel model)  .

save your money and buy the equally good s2 is which can now be bought for around $350 vs  .

the $500 for the s3 is .

i love all of the features it offers  .

i've owned this camera since november of 2007  .

just recently , our house flooded  .

well , i is inclined to take pictures for insurance purposes , but when i couldn't find the date/time stamp in the options , i is highly confused  .

i went online to the canon support site and could not find anything about it  .

so , i randomly googled my problem and came up with a whole bunch of pages and reviews complaining about there not being a date/time stamp i love the camera though , even without the date/time stamp  .

it is very reliable and doesn't drain batteries as fast as a lot of my cheaper cameras  .

the zoom and speed shot features are , by far , my favorites  .

i have really shaky hands due to nerve damage , and to be able to catch a picture that's not blurry is a miracle  .

the neck strap is a good feature too , because of my hands  .

although , i have dropped it a few times here and there , it has not given me any problems , other than restarting  .

it is a very sturdy camera and very easy to clean the lense  .

before today , i would have given it a 5 , but i just cannot because of that one flaw  .

sorry canon  .

i do have to say , it is one of the best $300 investments i've ever made though , especially with my employee discount  .

^_____^  .

i recommend this camera  .

great camera , worth every penny  .

i had the s2 is , but it broke for some reason  .

since that camera made me warm in the happy parts of my soul , i decided to go 'head and upgrade i cannot say enough about the vari    angle lcd  .

if you have not used one before , you really really need to try it  .

it allows for much more creativity (and let's face it furtivity) when taking shots  .

the 12x optical zoom is now about standard for this class , but the vari angle lens kills the competition for me  .

if canon comes out with a vari    angle slr with a workable live view , i might finally make that jump the start up is quick and silent and rarely makes me miss the shot  .

the video feature is a very nice add on , but the video encoding that canon decided to use will go through your sd cards pretty fast  .

you should have somewhere to dump your files  .

(i use the creative zen for in field transfer and a wd portable hard drive back at the internet cafe )  .

in all i would recommend this camera  .

hell i might even try the s5  .

i bought this camera instead of a dslr , mainly because of the price difference  .

i have to say , that this camera is simply the next best thing to dslr  .

every day i use it i discover a new feature or new setting that allows me to take my photography to the next level  .

this camera can easily be used for professional photography  .

lens filters can also be used with it to enhance shots  .

a lens adapter will be needed , but its inexpensive and worth it  .

overall i have been very pleased with the performance of this camera , and if you are looking for a dlsr but find that you cannot afford it , i would recommend this camera instead , no doubt about it .

had this camera since 2/2007  .

it is awesome  .

thank you , canon , for a great product  .

this camera makes everybody look so pretty in the picture    amazing  .

love the fact that it doesn't require expensive proprietary batteries does not even need rechargeable  .

camera works great with regular (duracell or costco's kirkland brands) aa batteries  .

when you take as many pics as i do , you'll be grateful too as you change the batteries mid    shot  .

is a little frustrated at first when camera refused to take the shot even when i had it lined up perfect  .

then switched to hi    speed sd card and that took care of that nicely  .

sometimes looking at shots through the viewfinder , it seems like the shot is fuzzy but when i look at the screen , they're almost always gorgeous  .

in panning the camera to take close    up shots , sometimes it does take a bit of time to get the focus perfect but all in all love this camera  .

reading through the inst manual makes me lose my focus as the technical stuff is way over my head  .

appreciate it being there though as i look forward to the day i can comprehend the technical aspects  .

in the meantime , i'm just taking the shots .

so , i've been jonzing for a digital camera for some time now , and relied heavily on these cnet reviews , as well as steves cameras , and pc magazine , and whatever god    forsaken review sites there are out there  .

this is going to be my first digital camera purchase , so needless to say , i is really cautious in doing so i'm pretty much an amateur photographer , looking for a camera that had an artistic edge to it , and i definitely believe that i found it with this camera  .

the mega zoom , coupled with the image stabilization is such a f'in kick @$$ combo , that its made me a long life cannon fan  .

and on top of the mega zoom , there's super macro feature that'd like putting a magnifying glass on the subject the only thing that gets to me is that the manual focus (something i cannot do without) is a button i have to hold down on the side of the lens  .

it can get kinda annoying , especially when trying to take quick action shots  .

but then again , the auto mode on this thing is pretty darn smart  .

leaving it on produces images that are sometimes even better than what my amateur @$$ can do so for anyone starting out in photography , and wants to one day maybe take it a step further , and do some real professional/ artistic stuff with it some day , this is the camera for you  .

it's also good if you just want to take normal (boring) pictures , that is , if you don't mind the size like me i wouldn't recommend this camera to people to experts , and people who are spoiled by dslrs , and general idiots who do not know a camera from their @$$#0le$ bottom line   this camera is f'in awesome in features , quality , and of course in price .

for those who are not ready to make the techinal or financial leap to slr , this camera offers the simplicity of a point    and    shoot with the advantage of megazoom  .

its design lightweight , sleek and intuative , and it offers a range of automatic and manual settings the major drawback of this camera is the lack of focus at maximum and minimum zoom  .

the macrofocus is soft , making it near impossible to get an extreme close up of your subject , and pictures are noisy at maximum zoom .

well , im an amateur photographer and thought id finally kick things up a bit  .

so after 3 months of frustrating research , i finally went for this camera  .

i researched the kodak 612/712 , the fuji s700 , the sony h9/h7/h2 , but still went for this (though wud have gone for the kodak had it been available at the time because of the price)  .

ive had this camera for 3 weeks and i cant get my hands of it  .

pics are great , colours are very well saturated , shutter lag is very small  .

movies are of high quality but the compression leaves a lot to be desired  .

hmmm all in all im happy i went for this camera has been a greta buy ill get bak to u guys in case i discover glitches or some other good thing later  .

i have a dslr and it rarely gets used , this camera does it all , and i dont have to lug around a lot of lenses to get the same quality captures , i am considering selling my dslr as the canon s3 takes pictures just as good , i do wish it had raw support though , but i can deal without it  .

if you are looking for a camera , for all occassions that will give top notch shots the canon s3 is the way to go , i use rechargeables in mine and battery life is good , do get a 2gb card home movies are fun and you can get a lot get this camera you will not be disappointed  .

this camera is wonderful  .

i have to admit that i do not have a good background in the subject to compare thoroughly , but overall , i know what a good image looks like  .

for anyone who's not sure what to pick for their needs , you can look at this as sort of a bridge camera between point and shoot/dslr  .

it has the amazing zoom for those far away shots , a good is feature , impressive custom settings , and a very useful flip around screen believe it or not , that flip screen really does help a lot for taking angel shots , self portraits  .

or over the crowd shots  .

even floor shots looking upward look amazing when using the flip screen the 6  .

0 megapixals are all you need unless your trying to make a building sign  .

and the interchangeable lenses are a nice treat if your willing to spend the doe on it also , video is phenomenal  .

the stereo audio is very nice and the video is soooo clear , you can just let your old camcorder collect dust cuz this is all you need  .

and the greatest feature that i love and cannot find in any other camera is the ambility for this camera to shoot pictures in the middle of the video  .

bad thing is that the snap of the photo is seen in the video , but for me personally , i like the look  .

makes it look like paperatzzi video , lol  .

it just doesnt make for a smooth video with no clicks if thats what you want overall , this camera has a great price , a great balance btwn the complexity of an slr and simplicity of a point and shoot , and i highly recommend it for the amature/casual user  .

it also works extrmely well for those who are a little afraid of the slr world or cannot afford it right now (like me) , but definitely want to eventually get there .

i just upgraded from a 5    year old , 2mp elph  .

i took a lot of great pictures with that little camera , but really wanted to take some higher quality photographs  .

i thought about dslr's but the price and taking the time to learn how to use it discouraged me  .

so i decided on an advanced point and shoot  .

like many others , it came down to the sony and the canon  .

since i is already familiar with the set    up of canon's buttons and features i chose the s3  .

from the very first test photo's i took (on the practically useless 16mb card) i is thoroughly impressed  .

the clarity and the sharpness of the pictures were outstanding compared to the old camera  .

i is amazed by the detail it captured , i is used to photographing beautiful sunsets then being disappointed once i downloaded the pictures  .

i do not know if it is the lens or the megapixels (or if i would be equally impressed with the sony) , but it is like watching an hdtv after years of the old tv set  .

as for the complaints i read about this camera   1) small screen    it is big enough and i had the camera on vacation for a week , took 400+ pictures and did not have to re    charge the batteries once  .

the larger the screen the more power used  .

i also like the fact that you can pull out and angle the screen , a feature many video camera toting parents are used to using  .

2)too many buttons    they are placed well and very functional  .

3) flash    agreed  .

it has to be manually popped    up which is inconvenient when used to full automation  .

4) flimsy output cover    nitpicky  .

a camera is a delicate instrument , so it should be handled with some care , unless you are using a shovel to access the digital jacks it should not be a problem  .

overall , it is bulkier than my old elph , but it has the same ease of use with nearly professional looking photo's .

it took me about 2 and a half to 3 weeks to find the camera that is right for me  .

i thought i wanted a camera that had more than 8 megapixels , and more than 10x zoom  .

but , i also wanted a camera that i could fit in my pocket and take with me where ever i could go  .

i is stuck between the powershot s3 and the sony h5  .

i chose the s3 for many reasons  .

i have been buying canon digital cameras ever since i got into photography  .

all of their cameras i have chosen had met my needs  .

i have heard many bad reports about sony and how they have had many technical difficulty problems , and many have sent back to sony for good now a little about the s3 and its features  .

the s3 has many options that you can choose from  .

it has movie modes , scene mode , portrait , landscape , fast shot , manual , apature , shutterspeed , tv , and custom  .

i'm sure youve figured that out by now  .

all of these modes gives you many options as to the sitution that you are in  .

the high powered flash is very helpful at night , and the shots look like you took them in daylight  .

i did some tests with this by at night i would have all the lights off , and i would use the flash and take a picture of a desk or something  .

the photo came out as if it were daylight  .

the zoom is a great quality  .

do not let the 15x zoom of the h5 fool you  .

that is only optical  .

it has 2x digital whereas the s3 has 4x digital totaling it's zoom to 48x , and the h5 to 30x  .

canon 1    sony 0 my previous camera the powershot a700 , came with a 2  .

5 inch lcd  .

so , it is a bit of a downsize , but the rotating screen made up for it and its really not that bad  .

you do not need your super glasses to see the screen  .

it is clearly visible , and if you dont have to move the camera around to get the light from hitting the screen and creating a glare  .

the h5 has a 2  .

5 in lcd , but it does not rotate  .

canon 2    sony 0  .

the movie mode on the canon is amazing  .

the 30 fps on the 640x480 is like a camcorder  .

the sony h5 has the same size , but at 30 fps , you have no audio  .

thats no good  .

you only have audio on the 640x480 at 15fps  .

canon 3    sony 0 i thought about lugging around this superzoom camera after i had bought it and i is asking myself constantly what have i done what have i done  .

but , when the camera arrived , i is surprised  .

i could not tell the difference between the powershot a700 , and the s3 is  .

the image stabilization on the s3 is is a great feature  .

so far , i have taken 356 shots , and not 1 has been blurry  .

the ease of use on this camera is great as well  .

my mother who has never shot a camera other than a disposable one in her life , took pictures with ease  .

the placement of the zoom button has always been easily accessable unlike the sony h5 where it is above the directional pad  .

canon 4    sony 0 the canon powershot s3 won it over for me against the sony h5  .

i have had this camera for about 1 week , and am very satisfied with it  .

if you are someone who doesnt want to take that extra step and learning curve , and 300 $ , then this is the right camera for you i hope i is of help ,  .

thanks ,  .

steve       ma  .

i love this and would continue to buy canon looking for a video camera  .

this is the best camera i have owned yet  .

its got the look and feel of a dslr  .

it records great movies , takes great stills and has a stabilized zoom over 400mm  .

highly recommend for sports or nature shots with the great zoom and macro modes  .

black finish is a real nice touch by canon  .

microphone records stereo so your movies turn out really nice  .

you would be hard pressed to find a better long zoom range camera in this price point .

i got this for christmas and i really love it  .

i used it on my trip to ca recently and got really great pictures and movies  .

the microphone is greally strong and picks up sound well  .

at first it is a little heavy but comes with a really good neckstrap  .

it is a little intimidating at first since i is not used to all the choices  .

but after going through the getting started manual it is really easy  .

i like the fact you could take single photos while recording in movie mode with audio  .

the zoom feature is really good  .

it also has image stabilzation and red eye reduction which is a big help since i am a fairly novice picture taker .

i bought this camera to replace my old fuji s3000 6x zoom 3  .

2mp  .

i still didn't feel ready for a d    slr (too much camera for my abilities and much too big to want to carry anywhere) , but i wanted a big zoom (for me , prohibitively expensive option on a d    slr) , so no pocket camera made the grade for me  .

after reading reviews , handling and comparing this and the panasonic lumix dmc    fz7k (a lot cheaper , similar features and quality) , i bought this one  .

i love it  .

in auto mode , i'm very happy , and taking manual mode pics are a slow but steady learning experience (which i knew going into the purchase , but is something i wanted to experience and grow with i was not looking for a cheap point and shoot)  .

i have to keep the supplied manual with me in my camera case for more creative shots , but i'm having a lot of fun with it  .

so many features if i care to use them , and auto if i don't  .

personally , i'm glad there's no date    stamp to turn off i hate them and have no need for them , but i understand others complaining about the lack of it if they use it on other cameras  .

another big factor for me is the aa battery usage i just did not want a proprietary expensive battery to purchase as an extra , so i spent the extra money for the better reviewed camera , and i'm quite happy 2 months into ownership  .

it feels very solid , love the black vs  .

the prior version's silver , love the flipping (but small) lcd  .

i have not even tried the movie feature yet , but i've read it's fun  .

plus , i liked the option of getting an adapter tube to use optional lenses , which i've done and enjoyed  .

and now the price is falling i'd definately buy one again  .

i bought this to replace a canon powershot s400  .

that camera is great for portability , took some good shots and still takes them after about 5000 pics  .

i wanted to sacrifice the small size for a bigger zoom and a little more resolution  .

i got what i asked for  .

the s3 is has a great zoom and takes more colorful and crisper pictures than the s400  .

i love it  .

if it holds up like the s400 did , canon has my business next time too .

i documented my 10 day vacation with this camera and took over 700 shots and i must say over 70% of them i is pleased enough to have printed  .

startup time is very quick with camera , allowing you to capture most moments on the fly w/ no trouble  .

almost all the manual control you need is implemented perfectly (save manual focus , which is a bit awkward , and spotty but in this class , aren't they all  .

colors appear accurate and a bit on the warm side (which is how i like it)  .

noise is very low for a camera of this class up to 400iso  .

up to a 10 minute video can be shot on the canon at 640x480 and it looks great , however i wish canon had opted for a more compressed video format to allow for more recording time , and that they did not limit the time to 10 minutes per file  .

the only other cam i considered for my sub $500 price range (i ended up getting the canon in the low $300s) is the sony h5  .

the h5 feel is very consumerish ; felt lighter , more plasticy , and the biggie   the manual control is slower and less intuitive (having to move up and down to access a setting and then left or right to adjust)  .

if you're not going for a dslr (for reasons of price or heft) i cannot recommend a better cam .

my wife and i bought the s3 for christmas and are very happy  .

it's easy to use right out of the box  .

we had a small point and shoot and this is a great upgrade  .

indoor pictures look great with or without the flash  .

without the flash , i usually take 2    4 pictures right in a row and one turn out without any blur  .

the camera starts up super quick and resets to take another quick pic  .

i researched camera to death in the $350    $400 range and this is the best with the most features  .

i got it from sam's club for $329 , so check around  .

i have read that people have been getting blurry pictures indoor , just use a monopod or tripod and it works perfect .

i recently got a powershot s3 and quite happy with it i researched the digital world extensively , desiring to upgrade from my trusty kodak dx 3215 , as it is quite limited and i needed something more robust  .

i looked into obtaining a strict dslr , but the prices are in the high hundreds and low thousands out of my price range  .

and i wanted the capability of shooting video  .

the s3 had everytning i desired and more  .

the movie feature is quite nice , even at it's lowest settings baseline prices were averaging around $399  .

00 , with small variations  .

on    line deals were slightly better , but not much , and i prefer to pick up my electronics in person to examine the product  .

i saw an ad from officemax offering the s3 for $369  .

00    with an instant $30  .

00 in    store rebate  .

they threw in a free 512mb sd card and the option to purchase a $100  .

00 canon photo printer for $30  .

i took the offer , but declined the extended warrenty of $79  .

00 for two years  .

i could have waited till the prices came down some more , most likely after christmas , but i liked the deal offered  .

i am happy with the purchase it has plenty of zoom (12x) , takes very good images , and the sharpness of the images are quite good  .

i have plenty of experience with my old 35mm nikon film camera , and the s3 exceeds it in many areas  .

i do not miss at all lugging around various lenses and accessories , and this camera has plenty of features to satisfy the photographer i have experimented with the manual controls and find them exceptional , with real time results  .

and as an additional benefit , everybody who has seen it , has complimented me on the purchase even die hard strict dslr users  .

i will look into aftermarket lens hoods and tele    converters to enhance the performance astrophography     .

i needed a camera for astrophotography , and i hope this one will serve well , but one nagging observation it's remarkable that i have been able to record stars , constellations and nebulae with just the camera lens , but i find it bothersome that i cannot focus stars down to pin points , it just stops short  .

i do not know if this is inherent to all digital cameras , but maybe it's just mine there are examples of my practice begining astrophotography efforts with the powershot s3 here    .

well i had an s1 is before and upgraded to this camera and all i can say is that i is just amazed at the improvement in quality  .

it is easy to see when viewing photos which were taken with the s1 and which with the s3  .

i is looking at the sony equivalent to this as i liked the larger screen on the sony but this had better images  .

i am now making use of the 'bracketing' when taking photos and this is just fantastic too  .

i love the steeo sound and this is one of the very few digital cameras to offer this .

like many other photographers conclusions , my pursuit of a digital camera with near dslr capabilities on a budget came down to a familiar three    12x zoom / image stabilized choices   the sony h5 , the canon s3 is , and the lumix (panasonic) dmc fz7  .

after pouring over specifications , reviews , and getting some hands    on impressions , i came to the happy conclusion that all are great choices and that if any two were not on the market i would be lusting after that one remaining camera  .

in short , its great to have these options the image quality of all three cameras is comparable and any differences are certainly within minor post    processing tweaks of one another , however , they all suffer image quality limitations from 400 iso upwards  .

beyond the magenta / blue ghosting and inherent image noise level comparisons you read about they can all produce excellent digital pictures  .

face it , youre gonna sweeten your best shots with post processing anyway so as long as the shots are crisp (of which all three cameras are capable) the image quality shakes out within marginal preferences of one another my current photo needs are driven by family  .

i am a father of three & i have a cheerleader , a football player , and a soccer player to chase after so action weighs heavy in my decision  .

with all three cameras performing best in the iso 200 and below range none are truly ideal for sports or fast action (even with image stabilization) so whatever advantages can be found become decision makers for me  .

initially this places the sony h5 at some disadvantage (not that its bad , its just not quite as good) due to its slower performance specs compared to the canon and the lumix  .

the canon s3 is and lumix dmc fz7 both excel with   fast start    up / fast shot    to    shot , 2fps continuous burst mode , fast focus , fast zoom , and sd extreme iii ram compatibility (20mb / sec   twice the speed of sd ultra ii)  .

the canon has the unique ability to capture snapshots (stills) while in mid    stream video mode (major coolness) and it runs on 4 standard aa batteries enjoying the longest battery life of all three cameras (i hate running out of power)  .

needless to say , these features appeal strongly to my needs the sony h5 is , to my eye , the most aesthetically appealing of the cameras and i love the 3 lcd on the back  .

there is no better way to show off your shots than on a big display (its impressive) and its better for editing pictures on the spot , however , thats not how i use a camera  .

i dont edit on the camera , if anything i bracket my shots , keep moving , and sort through them all later  .

i prefer to edit images on a pc & for me , the camera back lcd is simply a reference screen  .

i find the refresh rate of the lcd for viewing action to be more critical and although the 2 display on the canon is the smallest of the three cameras it has the best resolution with the fastest refresh rate  .

the size difference of the canon display is easily overcome by simply moving the camera a little bit closer to my face (im an old 35mm slr guy and used to having an eye on the viewfinder so this is no compromise)  .

also , as the primary photographer in the family i am frequently out of the picture (behind the camera) by default  .

a 180 degree flip of the canon s3 lcd allows composition of personal and group shots at arms length (with me in the picture  .

) & i love that  .

additionally , the canon lcd can be turned around so the screen is protected  .

with 3 kids this is not a small consideration i didnt care for the appearance of the canon as much as the sony or the lumix largely because of all the buttons  .

that said , functionally i found the buttons well placed and often providing faster access than scrolling through menus for options (i  .

trashing a bad photo , moving between modes , shortcut programmable buttons)  .

at first i preferred the thumb friendly zoom control of the sony h5 but later found the index finger zoom controls of the canon s3 and the lumix dmc fz7 to be more responsive and both cameras auto    focused faster than the sony  .

the lumix controls were nice but i had to access the menus more often than the canon to get what i wanted , if lumix had shortcuts i wasnt able to find them bottom line   the lumix dmc fz7 is the most affordable of the three and a strong contender for action work (the lumix is my second choice) but has no compelling unique features and requires proprietary ($) rechargeable batteries  .

the sony h5 has that great 3 display but is not a strong player in the action arena and it carries the heftiest price tag  .

the canon s3 is has the best action performance with the longest battery life , runs on standard aas (rechargeables an option) , uses standard / ultra / or extreme iii sd ram , and has gobs of great additional features that stretch well beyond my current needs i bought the canon s3 is and im delighted .

i have read all of the 47 reviews currently posted for this camera  .

the good reviews all praise the features of this camera  .

the bad reviews almost all decry the fact that the s3 is shown no great improvement over the s2 is  .

not the point of a camera review , reallyy  .

this second category of reviews has nothing to do with the camera  .

they all criticize cannon and its manufacturing and marketing policies  .

too bad , because this artificially lowers the rating of a camera that deserves a solid 8  .

5 or 9 .

i did not have an s2 is so i cannot comment on the differences  .

i got it because i wanted something more compact than an slr , good picture quality , maximum zoom range , and image stabilization for usie at athletic events  .

it has performed exceptionally for this purpose  .

it's video capabilities are just an added bonus for me , but quite impressive some have noted that it's a bit pricey , but from what i can determine it is well constructed and should be quite durable       justifying the higher price .

my last camera is the olympus c    770 uz so naturally i gravitated back to olympus  .

i also looked at the sony and canon  .

olympus also has a new 10x uz , the sp    510 uz  .

1 megapixel  .

i originally purchased it as i already had the xd cards because i thought i could save a few bucks  .

but oh what a mistake  .

very slow write times and all the different modes , such as landscape , portrait , etc  .

have to be accessed via lcd menu and not through dial on top of the camera as there is for the sony and canon very annoying for me , optical zoom is everything w/o having to lug around a full size slr  .

for about 70 bucks more , i could have the sony h5 w/ the extra 1  .

1 megapixel  .

i however chose the canon because of the swivel lcd screen , a evf that doesn't jut out the back like the sony , the camera strap holders , and the fact that this feels like a slr , albeit only smaller  .

i use a 35mm for work everyday and the comfort zone is there  .

the canon seems heavier but feels more more solid than the sony i would have bought the sony because of the beautiful big honkin 3 inch lcd screen which is beautiful , but i just couldn't overlook the sony evf that sticks out the back and the zoom buttons located on the back of the camera  .

it's the little nuances that bothered me  .

hence , try them both out before buying the canon is not w/o it's faults as indicated above , including the manual pop up flash feature , but it's miles ahead of my old camera , and the tilt feature on the lcd is the clincher  .

a excellent camera overall and i do not think anyone can go wrong between the canon or sony if you're looking for a uz camera .

this is my first digital camera in ultra zoom category  .

i bought it two weeks back after reading many online reviews  .

so far i am very pleased with the results  .

image stabilization works great and the movie mode is the best i have seen in point and shoot category (much better than older 640x480 consumer level digital camcorders)  .

photos are sharp and colors are vibrant  .

however i would have been happier if it produced slightly less noise with high iso settings , but then again at $340 the pros far outweigh the cons  .

for anyone looking for a good high zoom still camera with good movie capabilities i think s3 is is on top  .

ofcourse sony h5 and panasonic dmc series have higher mp rating  .

, but i really do not think paying $100 more for negligible image quality improvement is worth it , considering their poor movie performance .

a good compromise between a dslr and regular point and shoot camera  .

i originally wanted the canon rebel but did not want to lug around such a big camera  .

i wanted something a little more flexible than point and shoot , so i ended up w/ this camera i could not be happier w/ my decision  .

at first the low megapixel rating somewhat turned me off  .

but once i started taking pictures , that concern quickly went away  .

it took sometime to get use to all the features and settings  .

i read the manual from cover to cover and it paid off .

i waited a long time to by my own camera  .

personally i think this is the best for me as of right now  .

the is a few features that attracted me the 12x zoom , tilt and swivel lcd , and the look after using it from june 15th to july 24th i could not be happier  .

i know in the future i will go slr because i is raised on an original and my left hand need something to do  .

recent purchase and still learning  .

bought the extra wide angle and telephoto lenses and the filter set , already using same  .

the lock focus and exposure controls very useful  .

like the one button movies  .

could not live without the stabilization  .

total information onscreen/viewfinder  .

great all around camera  .

pruchased from abe's of maine , good price , excellent service  .

(thanks , doug)  .

i finally had the money to get a new digital camera which i had been wanting for about 1 year but is not high on the list of priorities since the current one still worked  .

i is going for a point and shoot originally but then got given some money towards a camera and decided that it is worth to spend 500cdn instead of 300 and get a great camera to keep for a number of years  .

this one fit the bill  .

my price range is up to 600cdn dollars for the camera and my competitors were the panasonic lumix fz    7 and the sony h5  .

the fz    7 is lightning fast but used expensive battery packs and apparently the durability was not the best , and the sony h5 disapointed me when i found out that the highest shutter speed is (if i remember correctly) 1/1000th and would be low for capturing action shots , as well the flash could take up to 17 sec  .

to recharge thus the chance of missing photos ops  .

also , if you want to take a few movie shots , the canon has a quieter lens so when zooming you won't get lens noise in the audio i settled for the canon , sturdy , quick , solid build and great battery life  .

(i bought energizer nimh 2500mah and have taken approx 600 photos and a few movie clips on a charge as well as uploaded photos and movies [movies are huge files] around 4 times and there is still no low batt symbol runs on those 4 aa's for long time  .

) i is impressed with the shutter speed and easy to use manual controls via the toggle switch when in manual mode or some of the other manual option modes  .

the camera feels solid in your hand and the large grip is great  .

i wish it came with a hood for those bright outdoor shots (otherwise buying a hood for it from canon costs 50cdn bucks  .

way too much for a screw on piece of plastic  .

) i am pleased with the startup time  .

if you see somethign to take a photo of its on in seconds and ready instantly  .

the burst mode is decent and if you see photos you need to take there is no lag to upload to the memory card , even a slower one which i used while waiting for my 2gb high speed 133x card  .

although using a highspeed card like that there is a noticeable difference in how quick the camera saves photos  .

i am pleased with the quality of the movies  .

i took a few shot shots and found them to be excellent  .

i also tested the flash and it lit up most medium sized rooms well and if your subjects aren't moving too much just turn down the shutter speed to about 1/50 indoors and you don't need the flash (this can be really helpful if you do not want that glare of the flash or are taking pictures that involve glass , or reflectants)  .

last off , the zoom can be quick to zoom in just pull on the toggle all the way and it zooms in instantly  .

the focus can have problems if there is not enough light at 12x zoom but otherwise is great  .

the ois (optical image stabilizer) works excellent  .

i can take hand held shots using both optical and digital and get a clear image for anyone who is an amateur but really into photography or wants a good camera that has plenty of features to appease for under $550cdn this is the route to go  .

all i have to say is that i loved how you wrote the intro  .

i purchased this camera one week ago today  .

i have taken nearly 500 photos this week  .

over 99% of the photos were successful and brilliant  .

some of the photos were taken indoors and some outdoors  .

the image stabilizer is on for all of the photos  .

i also experimented with an optional wide    angle lense  .

the wide    angle lense worked great on the s3  .

however , i would not advise anybody to use uv filters with the s3 , as it causes a decrease in photo quality , especially when using one of the built    in scene modes or one of the preset white balance options file transfers were very fast  .

battery life is great when using rechargeable batteries  .

i am using gp 2700mah ni    mh aa batteries and have not received any low battery warnings this week this camera has one of the highest shutter speeds in its class at 1/3200 sec  .

most other cameras in this class get around 1/2000 sec  .

, including the sony models  .

also , the s3 uses the industry standard sd card , instead of expensive proprietary cards like memory stick or xd i recommend this camera to anyone who wants a point and shoot camera with an slr feel and look .

this is my first digital camera  .

i is doing research for about 6 month already until i settled for s3 is  .

i is comparing many of them and canon is able to offer more than its competitors were  .

i have been using camera a couple of days now and i am very pleased with the results  .

i am in the process of experimenting and i think every new user should do that  .

i is reading many reviews with comments on poor picture quality in low light settings and similar , but i think it is just matter of practice and knowledge  .

camera like canon s3 is requires you to go through the manual and make yourself familiar with many of its options personally , i would like for the flash to open itself automatically , rather than manual  .

another thing that i would like is for the pictures to be dated  .

since i have baby girl i would like my pictures to have the date on them , this way you only have date in the picture info i would recommend this camera to anyone who wants better than average , quality , and stylish product .

i bought the canon s3 is today  .

i upgraded from a kodak easyshare ls443 that i purchased back in 2003  .

i is not planning on replacing my camera anytime soon  .

it sounded as ridiculous as replacing a three year old refrigerator  .

but when i saw the s3 is , i couldn't help myself  .

it's a drastic improvement over my previous camera  .

the electronic viewfinder is amazing , and i have no idea how i got by without a super macro mode  .

the movie quality is outstanding  .

i have not been able to put it down since i bought it  .

(i would recommend getting a larger memory card , movies take up a lot of space  .

) easy to use and overall great camera .

i bought this right before a trip to eastern europe because i had been eyeing the s2 for over a year  .

when the s3 came out (at an incredibly decent price) , i bought it same day  .

i think i hesitated to buy the s2 becuase i is unsure whether i should upgrade to a slr or stay in the powershot series , but i am a lot more satisfied with myself that i got the s3  .

it still has all the manual functions for more creative shots , 12x zoom (no additional lenses required means not missing any good shots when on the go) , super macro (once again , no need for additional lens with you can focus at 0 centimeters)  .

i just got back from a month    long trip and had no major issues with the camera  .

printed out about 100 pictures the other day at a lab , and had phenomenal image quality the only downside of this camera is the viewfinder  .

i do not know if the other s    models had this , but the viewfinder is just a smaller lcd screen displaying a digital image (you can also review your other photos in the viewfinder)  .

meaning , when taking a picture and the sun is too bright , you cannot see anything through the lcd becuase it is equivalent to using the larger lcd on the back ; everything looks white  .

the data displays on the mini lcd are great , as found in slrs , but the image itself is also digital as opposed to real  .

the photo    quality result is the same , of course , but it makes it rather difficult to know if the composure of your shot is good or not becuase of the lighting conditions however , the majority of the time , the digital viewfinder is amazing becuase it is exactly 100% to size of what the real photo will be like (as opposed to some real viewfinders that show less area)  .

but for those sunny days , youll wish there is a way to switch it off .

i have been researching digital cameras for a while  .

i owned a nikon coolpix 990  .

it took great pictures  .

i loaned it to a friend and he damaged the camera this canon is amazing  .

i don't need any more mega pixels  .

the size is good , and the fact that is uses aa batteries is a plus  .

you never know when you may not be able to charge rechargeable the zoom is great , sd memory is so inexpensive , i is able to buy 1g for $35 at best buy the features , color swap , stereo sound for movies i cannot say more i have taken noisy pictures and non    noisy pictures  .

it all depends on the conditions i know the camera cannot be a 10 , nothing is perfect , but this is about a close as i have seen for a non    dslr camera  .

if you get the chance , buy it  .

do not let the buttons and features overwhelm you  .

you and the camera will become one after a couple of pictures in different settings .

just got my s3 is and am very happy  .

i have finally upgraded fom my fuji 6800z  .

having read all the reviews it seems that if you only include the reviews from people who actually own this model the rating would be over 9 , but i suppose everone is entitled to their 2 cents worth  .

i had an s1 for 2 years and liked it  .

the s3 is a big step up with the macro/supermacro modes  .

also i think the ergonomics have improved and the resolution bump is nice  .

the camera also seems faster and performs much better in low light than the s1  .

the flip out lcd is now 2 inches which is a lot more useful  .

the fact that it rotates is massive when taking shots at odd angles .

this is an impressive package  .

i upgraded from the pro 90 is (three generations of long zooms back       and it cost more than twice as much as i paid for the s3 is on friday and got a free hp printer to boot  .

) , so this is a massive improvement in capabilities  .

i've been playing with it in spare moments and am very satisfied .

the camera offers me good to great quality videos , with sound that is very good  .

i have the shakes yet i still get a lot of good photos  .

the image stabilization is as promised  .

it is a nice upgrade from the s2is  .

i wish i could afford a nice mark iii dslr with image stabilizing lenses but i cannot  .

this really gives me all the zoom and fun of a dslr at a reasonable price .

great camera  .

not perfect , but none are  .

for what it is , though , it's excellent once again , cnet does a quick review and does not get all thier facts right  .

this bad boy has two speeds of burst , 1  .

5 fps with live preview in between , and 2  .

3 fps showing the most recent shot  .

both work great  .

one allows more pictures , the other better following of the subject  .

the best part is , you have both modes and can choose rather than most cameras that only have one mode available try dpreview for a more detailed and accurate review .

i manage a cord camera store in the indianapolis area  .

customers who are looking for this type of camera have no idea what raw is and could care less  .

they chose this type of camera because of the price point , the traditional style , and the zoom capability  .

raw is a foreign concept to these buyers  .

the reviewers comments on this are totally unrealistic .

people will be disappointed , such as myself , that canon would make such a mediocre upgrade  .

it's obviously an s2 on steroids and nothing more  .

that's great , but at least throw in 8mp , an oled display , manual focus    by    wire ring , 720x480 video , proper video compression  .

something that makes the sx is followers want to upgrade  .

what does it have  .

an extra 200px in each direction and a live histogram (compared to the excellent s2)  .

it's essentially an s2  .

still a 9 out of 10  .

(the 1 being for disappointment)  .

come on canon , is this how you're going to let the sx is line end  .

or are you leaving leg    room for an s4  .

i am looking forward to the actual release of the canon s3 is and will most likely buy it when it becomes available  .

as part of the decision process i search for objective information about a product , not statements like ; anything for more sales revenue , marketing is so boring or not a worthy upgrade  .

granted , at this time objective information about the s3 is a little tuff to come by since the camera has not actually been released  .

i do understand the s3 is an upgrade from the s2 , so i can see making some correlation between the two cameras , but to write a review based on the old model doesn't seem to help the c/net user opinion process  .

for those interest in this camera , check it out elsewhere on the internet and don't make your decision based on the average rating from c/net    at least not yet  .

i cannot tell you the s3 is is a great camera , since i do not have one but i am counting on it being one as i will be buying one as soon as it is available  .

on the positive side , i did enjoy the user opinion titled foolish reviews , of which this is another one and i do appreciate the c/net review process in general .

overall a great camera for the price .

i had strong allegiance to nikon    but i really like this canon  .

shop it around    i got it for less than 500 , and that is 2 years ago  .

i love being able to take video too    i got a 2 gig card so i can just take and take w/o worrying about having to switch out .

it is by no stretch of the imagination the best of breed in any single category , but the canon s3 tries to make up for that for doing virtually everything fairly well the button placements make shifting iso , recording a movie and other functions extremely easy rather than burying functionality deep in menus where nobody will find them photos are decent , but somewhat disappointing at the high end  .

if you are going to stick to 8 x 10 or smaller then you are fine , but details and fringing hurt the output in fine details while easy to set up for low light shooting , 800 (and even a bit at 400) iso is noisy and graining and requires a lot of post processing work to get a good image out of it  .

now that is better than many point and shoot cameras where you cannot get the shot at all , but sort of sets you up for disappointment later  .

the image looks decent on the rather small 2 lcd , but as soon as you copy them up to the computer you see just how grainy the picture is the articulating lcd as mentioned is small by today's standards at 2 but first of all , i don't edit my images on my lcd , so that does not bother me , but being able to turn the lcd so i can get pictures at odd angles without having to guess that i am pointing at the subject is a nice bonus to have i selected the s3 over the newer s5 because despite the advertising , the s5 does not have a true intervalometer for time lapse photography  .

i expected to use this feature more than i have , and this is not as important a feature as i originally thought (which i guess is why canon basically cut it out of the newer model) the camera is getting a little long in the tooth at this point  .

though 6 mp is enough for most point and shoot people to get a good 4 x 6 out of it , it is a bit light by today's standards of 8 and 10 mp cameras it is still a solid model camera , the image stabilization works well , and will be enough for most people , but it lacks the pizazz , mp count , and some of the new features such as face detection that is now common i would still take this model over the newer 8mp s5 which does not have enough different about it to justify the premium in price over the s3 model , but it would now be a tough choice between the s3 and for example some of the new lumix models with 18x zooms .

this is my first digital camera and i think that it is a great firs point and shoot camera  .

it has a really fast startup time great image quality and a very bright lcd here are the cons   poor video quality when viewed on a computer , takes a long time to focus sometimes and sometimes does not find anything to focus on , very small lcd so if you don't have very good vision (which i luckily do) this is not the right camera for you , the electronic viewfinder really is not that great but if you like that type of viewfinder (which i do not) then maybe you will like it , also it has a lot of shutter lag i myself am going to upgrade to a nikon d40 dslr which i think is better for what i need but i will still use my s3 .

this is a great camera that balances slr    like image quality , good video , and ease of use  .

you'll obviously get better images from a true slr , but having the added convenience of video sold me to this camera  .

i use it regularly and it's been great  .

i love the fact that it uses aa batteries  .

i don't think i'll ever buy a camera that uses proprietary li    on batteries  .

just does not make sense if you do a lot of traveling or outdoor/backcountry use .

a excellent camera  .

just keep in mind that it is a picture camera first , the video ability is just a bonus feature basically .

i have shot approximately 4000 pictures with my canon powershot s3 is  .

i have been using mode setting program (p) for indoors with iso 80 and the large superfine compression setting  .

for outdoors , i have been using shutter speed priority (tv) with iso 80 and the large superfine compression setting indoor pictures have been shot with and without flash , depending on the available indoor light sources  .

the flash seems a bit weak beyond ten feet , and a bit slow to recharge if you are trying to shoot quick successive shots  .

also , beyond ten feet i start picking up a lot of red eyes in my pictures using the flash  .

knowing these limitations , i have had very nice success with my indoor pictures outdoor pictures in bright sun and no shade have been shot from 1/1000 shutter speed with some clouds in the sky , to 1/1600 shutter speed with hardly any clouds in the sky outdoor pictures in bright sun , but in shaded areas have been shot from 1/250 shutter speed to 1/800 shutter speed pictures at an early morning outdoor sports activity with bright sun and long shadows from trees have been shot with a shutter speed of 1/500 at the early morning outdoor sports activity with the bright sun and long shadows from trees , there is no problem viewing the subjects with the viewfinder  .

also , continuous shooting mode worked very well  .

it perhaps , works a bit too well , because you start running out of card space quickly there have been no problems using the lcd monitor or viewfinder with the indoor shooting however , outdoor shooting is a different story altogether , except with the outdoor sports activity as mentioned above  .

the lcd monitor is extremely hard to see in bright sunlight  .

also , the viewfinder is extremely hard to see in bright sunlight  .

you point at your subject as best as you can make it out , and if there is enough time take a second shot , hoping for the best to obtain a good composition  .

here is where a computer photo program with cropping comes in quite handy i have had very nice success with my outdoor shooting battery life has been over 300 pictures with alkaline batteries about the strap  .

it seems to be holding up well , except that the lettering is starting to come off , and i have not had the camera four months , yet  .

the side of the strap that had powershot , now reads powersno  .

not a big deal , but if you are going to put your company name on the camera strap , do it well , or not at all  .

it just looks tacky .

for a beginner in photography and a very busy mom as well , this is the best  .

so , i'd like to thank ms  .

lori grunin for her consistent positive reviews because as of this moment , with all the new models coming in and all things being equal i believe , nothing could beat the s3is yet .

i love the feel of this camera and it has so many features i have only begun to scratch the surface  .

speaking of scratched surfaces , with the handy flip around and over viewer , mine will no longer get scratched  .

nice camera for a good price .

excellently priced camera (i paid $315 at park row's j r computerworld in new york  .

included is a panasonic 1gb sd memory , a lamborghini carrying bag , 4 power2000 2700mï¿½ batteries plus charger    thanks again , andrï¿½) a step up the ladder (for me) is the change in color frfom silver (s2) to black , plus the fact that the lens    cap fits properly and doesn't fall off any longer i only have good things to say regarding speed and photo quality , with these exceptions   the camera is not at all suited to make decent pictures at night/in the dark without flash or other artificial lightning  .

at rock    concerts , best choice is the sports mode , but even then pictures are shaky and way too grainy like stated elsewhere , once you go above iso200 , the pictures deteriorate into cheap old newspaper shots , where you can actually count the grains , giving the expression a shot in the dark new meaning  .

another annoying feature is the beam to autofocus  .

does not work on too brightly lit objects , so you cannot properly focus on them  .

which is very inconvenient when shooting , for example , a speedboat race on the river on a bright sunny afternoon but as a camera for day    to    day use , it is pretty decent , sporting 6  .

0 megapixels and a nice 12x optical zoom  .

and all that for just $300 cannot go wrong jj  .

this is a great camera for the price  .

slightly smaller than a dslr  .

well if you consider what a dslr 12x zoom lense would look like it is much smaller  .

and the quality is decent  .

enough manual controls to satisfy most  .

image stabilization great for long/dim shots overall a great value , but some things i pine for in a dslr    .

super tack sharp shots are hard to come by with this unless you have bright light , although 90% of that is the photographer , not the camera  .

no flash shoe , so no way to trigger an off camera flash unless you use optical slave  .

on cam flash is just ok  .

max shutter is 15 secs (i would love to play with night time open shutter shots of longer times)  .

if these things don't bug you , buy it  .

if they do you probably want a dslr anyway and wo not mind it being bigger/heavier/more expensive .

this is an impressive camera by canon , and in my opinion , perhaps the best non    dslr released by canon to date even better than it's newer model , the s5is let's start with canon's class    leading photo quality  .

the quality of outdoor shots at around iso 100 knocks my socks off  .

the color , sharpness , contrast , and detail really is nothing short of perfect  .

the s3is , in good lighting , pretty much captures the moment more accurately than most thousand    dollar slr cameras can hundreds of photos on one set of batteries  .

also , aa batteries are always a plus  .

they're easy to find in case your rechargeables poop out  .

i suggest some high nimh rechargeables  .

you'll do fine with those i'd ignore all the hype about the evf (electronic viewfinder) not being so great  .

the sad fact of life is that evfs are not great on any camera of any brand  .

these are tiny electric monitors and economic technology can only make these evfs so good  .

the evf on the s3is is no worse or better than the average on other brands , so don't look through the viewfinder with great expectations  .

i wouldn't consider this a con , more a fact of life and technology when you buy this camera , be aware that you're also buying a high quality camcorder  .

the videos the s3 can produce are amazing  .

unlike most movie    mode features of other cameras , the ois (optical image stabilization) can be enabled in movies allowing crisper , jitter free frame movement  .

also , since the camera is so quiet , you can zoom in and out with you 12x optical zoom while filming and not hear the buzzzzzzzzz that you'll hear on most other movie cameras  .

oh , and stereo sound thanks to dual microphones  .

hook up your videos to a nice sound system , and you'll hear a good stereo effect  .

i would honestly use this camera if i is making a student film project  .

i know the end result would be something of more    than    decent quality  .

one limitation , however , is the 1 gb file size limit , so on the highest quality and resolution , you can get about 8 minutes  .

if you have a 2 or 4 gb sd card , you can throw more than one video on the card , but the 1 gb limit stands so many fun options  .

from the novice to the advanced , this would be a fun camera to work with  .

try the color swap feature  .

i've praised this camera a bit , but like all cameras , it's not perfect  .

the indoor shots i've taken are pretty crummy  .

you can tweak the settings a bit to get improvement , but you won't get results that won't demand a noise removal tool  .

iso 800 is unusable most of the time , but you might get lucky in certain situations  .

for better indoor pictures with the s3is   increase the lighting if possible and use a flash  .

they wo not be artistic portrait shots , but they'll be clear , identifiable , and usable  .

speaking of the flash , you're going to have to learn to mind the manual pop up flash  .

that might not seem like much until you actually have the camera in your hands and you have to physically prop open the flash i would strongly advise you to seriously consider this over the newer s5is  .

unless if you need a hotshoe (external flash capability) and a few other ridiculous , insignificant features , the s3 comes $100 cheaper , and in the opinion of many , packs more of a punch when it comes to photo quality  .

the s5 is , as c|net states , losing ground to the competitors  .

the s3is , however , is perfectly capable , high quality , and a great value  .

dslrs are expensive  .

this is the next best thing for your money .

if i had to do it over again , i would buy the canon s3 is again , the powerful zoom x12 gives you excellent clear shots from far away , it is user friendly , although you have to get used to the is function , pressing too fast will give you an unfocused picture , reading the manual that it comes with is a advantage of learning all the powers that this camera holds .

i have been using a cheap hp camera for about two years when i finally saved up enough money for a better camera that will expand my photographic skills without spending loads of cash  .

i have been eyeing up this model for about a year when i took the plunge and bought it  .

and boy i is not disappointed  .

this camera has loads of features that will take a average person years to figure out  .

me on the other hand , a couple of months of experimenting and such to learn its limits  .

i do recommend to buy a monopod because even though it has a stabilization feature you will still get blurry pictures in less than ideal situations  .

overall a great camera for photographic enthusiasts that need more than a average camera to get the job done .

this is my 5th digital camera  .

i have a inexpensive sony pocket camera and a high end rebel xti  .

this is the happy medium if you can still get an s3is that is being replaced by the s5 is it is a steal at $300  .

00 great for beginners not ready to leap to the slr realm  .

takes great photos and has may nice features if you take the time to educate yourself on how to use them  .

love the lcd swivel screen and the digital viewfinder  .

you receive all available information the lcd provides yet you conserve battery life its kinda large by no means a pocket camera but those sacrifice quality and features  .

the lense cover and included 16 mb memory card are keeping this from being a nine .

before reading   if i could have given this camera an 8  .

5 i would have  .

now that i've gotten that out of my system i got this camera as a birthday present and i is extremely excited  .

i had asked for the panasonic lumix dmc    fz7k but i received this one because canon has a better record and the specs that i is mostly focused on (zoom and megapixels) were identical  .

more into the details   i love macro mode or flower mode as some people call it  .

taking pictures of plants up close is one of my favorite things , but sometimes the powershot focuses on things in the background  .

with practice , however , it is easier to trick the camera into focusing on what you want it to  .

my second complaint has to do with the manual focus because i can never tell whether or not it is on  .

with all the other modes a little graphic pops up and then stylishly zooms into the upper corner , but manual focus does nothing of the sort so i cannot tell if it's working  .

lastly , the zoom causes a little noise , but i don't really care much about that  .

as for the software , i've never actually used it because i just use iphoto and i don't usually do that much editing       so i have no comments on the software , only the hardware as for the pros , i love the large zoom because i often see small animals , such as lizards by my house , and i don't want to scare them away so i simply zoom up right next to them       and even the digital zoom is great  .

the features (especially the color replacement) are really fun and exciting to play with , i do not ever use them as a necessity but they are fun to play with , anyway  .

the last thing about pros i will talk about is the quality   absolutely beautiful  .

i love using pictures as my desktop , and even on my high    resolution imac , the pictures come out crystal    clear       really and honestly  .

oh , one more thing   the feel of the camera is perfect , nice and sturdy and the grip is a nice addition this camera is a great buy for both beginners (auto mode is wonderful) and pros (many features) and the price is right  .

good luck with your decision  .

an amazing camera  .

the zoom is unreal and the sports shots are perfect  .

my daughter does synchronized swimming so a great zoom and action shots are a must    what an awesome camera for these types of applications  .

and the video even on full zoom is crystal clear  .

i do not love the fold out lcd display because it gets in the way , takes longer to get set up and takes time to get used to when you line up your shots  .

but it's a small price to pay for amazing photos and video and a great price  .

i upgraded from a trusty s40 to this camera , and i am very pleased with the zoom capabilities and the feel of the camera  .

since i had experience with canon cameras before the switch is painless and quick , and the quality is wonderful for my uses (home enthusiast)  .

a nice camera for those who are looking for more features without having to go up to the slrs .

all around it seems like a great camera , but i have only had it for two weeks  .

one big dissappointment is that you cannot put a date stamp on the pictures except when printing using the supplied software as far as i have been able to tell  .

big no no for me esecially now that i have twins whom are constantly changing  .

the date stamp on my first camera helped with my wifes scrapbooking  .

cannon needs to make the date stamp option availabe on the camera because you are not always downloading onto your own computer .

after looking on this and other websites , reading the reviews and comparing to the sony cyber shot , i chose the canon  .

so far , i am very happy with my decision  .

for an amateur , it is a great camera regarding price for those who want to have the zoom capability  .

i took the camera recently to spain  .

i is able to get many great shots of flowers , scenery and landscapes  .

the colors are crisp and the movable lcd screen came in handy many times when taking a picture is not so easy there are a few things though that disappoint me  .

there is a very slim plastic label on the mode dial on top of the camera that shows you the options  .

this appears to be glued to the mode dial  .

at one point , the piece came off which is a draw back because you then need to rely on the lcd monitor to determine which shooting mode you want after the trip , i called canon customer service  .

i is bounced around to many different individuals  .

the end result   if i want them to fix it for free under the warranty , i need to send the camera in  .

i thought this is crazy  .

i tried to explain that the mode dial is working  .

i need only the mode dial label and glue it on myself  .

they could not accommodate me and if i choose to repair it myself , it would cost me $40 for a mode dial  .

they need to do a better job in their customer service department  .

it does not make sense to send in a whole camera when the issue is not mechanical another thing that needs mentioning is that i found myself dependent upon the lcd monitor to take pictures  .

whenever i tried to use the view finder , i found it to be blurry i am very happy with my camera overall  .

i recommend it to anyone who does not want to spend a fortune but still wants a quality camera .

the lens cover is awful  .

i have a stickey mess  .

i probably need to take it back  .

a piece of tape or whatever it is , wrapped in the lens cover has come unglued  .

you need to make sure the cheesey plastic cover is off before you turn on the camera  .

it has scratched the camera  .

i am not impressed with this high dollar camera  .

why would they make this feature so cheesy that has to be used everytime you turn on the camera  .

i like it , but i wish it had raw  .

it is a good in the middle camera , i wanted the eos rebel , but that is too costly , this is a great compromise .

as with many others this is a really tough call against the sony h5  .

as a matter of fact , after looking at many pictures on pbase , i is ready to buy the h5 because i felt sony's color rendition is slightly better  .

but the canon has a lot of ways to manage color with an extensive variety of advanced shooting functions  .

i also like the video feature , something i didn't think would matter much at first  .

i would have been happy with either camera and anyone who bought the h5 has an excellent camera that said i'll just go into what i like and don't like after taking a few hundred images with the canon i is suprised that my favorite feature turned out to be the swivel screen especially in conjunction with the super    macro feature  .

it's terrific  .

i can get the camera right on the ground to get fantastic mushroom shots , or just anything that is low to the ground  .

also , taking spider shots without getting my face too close to the spider is greatly appreciated  .

with a hi    speed memory card the images load in a blink of the eye  .

i also like the layout of the 'function' menu around the left side and bottom  .

it lets you quickly make a veriety of lighting/color changes while the image is still in your viewer  .

the stitch mode is neat , keeping part of the shot just taken to the left 1/3 of screen , while the new shot is to the right side what i don't like is the viewfinder , which i prefer to use over the monitor screen because i and hold the camera steadier  .

despite a menu setting to brighten it , it's still too dark compared to my old olympus uz 2100  .

and i cannot get good focus on it , no matter where i set it  .

also , i felt the recorded color tends to make leaves and grass verdent green , too green for me , unnaturally so  .

however , it is correctable with the many options in the function menu  .

(i turned the red up full , and the green down full  .

) now the trees and grass are truer to their original color as i see it i also don't like the lens barrel automatically extending and retracting when the camera is turned on and off  .

this seems to be common to a lot of cameras , including the sony  .

i think this will probably shorten the useable life of the camera by half  .

it's too bad manufacturers wouldn't make a menu option whereby the lens would stay extended when you turn the camera off  .

also the motor noise , though slight , alerts any wildlife you might be shooting one last thing  .

i bought a 2x tele    converter  .

it's terrible  .

the image is fuzzy at best  .

not to mention you have to make a change in the camera's menu to compensate for this attachment  .

even that didn't help  .

i do not know if canon's own teleconverter is any better , but i suspect it probably is  .

whether it's worth it or not is a personal choice by the user  .

i'm sorry i bought mine and i'll probably see if i can return it  .

just to be aware of the problem with 'after market' converters i do recommend purchasing the hood  .

it's great for holding down sun spots and necessary for adding any filters  .

i always use a uv when carrying it around in the woods , just to protect the camera lens  .

and i do like using a polarizer  .

look around the web  .

hood prices are all over the place overall , i'm very happy with the s3  .

i probably would have been as happy with the sony h5  .

canon's swivel screen , however , made the difference to me for the type of photography i enjoy .

i had the s1 and really liked the ability to take video along with still shots with the same piece of equipment  .

the better videos are edited down anyway  .

no one wants to sit and watch 15 mins of straight video  .

it needs to be edited down to get the full ability of this camera i would recommend a 2gb card  .

i actually bought a faster speed 2gb card  .

can take video and pics all day long i wanted to upgrade to the s3 to get more megapixels  .

it is worth it to me for the price , this camera is a good purchase  .

feels good in the hand  .

i is looking at the sony cybershot h5 but since i really liked my s1 and the learning curve wouldn't be much for me , and the biggest point for me , the h5's screen doesn't swivel so i stayed with canon  .

i've taken several shots that i wouldn't have been able to get if i had not been able to swivel the display screen i plan on purchasing the additional lenses for zoom and macro shots .

i just got this camera a couple days a ago and well i love it  .

i can really see what i have been missing not having a digital camera  .

i personally like canon  .

there cameras are good , really good , clean easy to use and take really good pictures  .

but i have found some areas that canon need to address  .

include a rechargable battery pack with a camera like this , a larger memory card (at least 1gb) and provide better online support for trouble shooting  .

other then that this is a awsome camera .

very pleased with this camera  .

it feels good in my hand the menu button can easily be activated by mistake , bit of a nuisance at times the is feature gives me crisp , clear shots at 12x or 48x , impressive  .

i have found it awkward to get into macro/super macro  .

it wo not go into super macro all the time , must be something i'm doing or not doing i like being able to bump the iso with a single push of a button , excellent in low light conditions .

this camera is very good  .

the stills are crisp , clear , and colourful  .

the video comes very close to camcorder quality  .

i do not know if one can add the vga (640x480 , 16 bit stereo sound) to your video that you extract from mini dv tape or other forms of storage (add to make a movie dvd)  .

does an expert know the answer to the video question  .

there's 20 or 21 shooting modes and 5 or so different exposure modes  .

there's in    camera red eye removal and stitch assist for making panoramas .

i am in korea , and this camera is readily available  .

i picked it up last week , and am enjoying it so far  .

i almost went for the s2 , but wanted the extra 320x240 movie mode at 60fps , which the s2 doesn't have  .

i like that the movies are recorded as quicktime , but my adobe premiere pro 1  .

5 software does not import them (a big disappointment)  .

i can import them into windows media encoder , though  .

i also is pleased to find it has a wide photo mode , as is mentioned in the review  .

yeah , it is just a crop , but that's fine by me  .

i am disappointed in the rendition of the green objects in the photos , but honestly , that seems to be a canon thing (my older s30 had the same issues)  .

grass and bright    green objects glow a bit unnaturally (especially when no flash is used)  .

you can adjust the colors a bit in    camera  .

i am experimenting with that , but so far it looks like photoshop is the best route for fixing this issue  .

i keep buying canon , though , because they usually offer a lot of bang for the buck  .

if you are pining over buying this model or the s2 , you can save a lot of money and get the s2  .

the difference in viewfinder size on the s3 really is not that much , and going to 6 megapixels over 5 is not a big deal for the average user  .

although the viewfinder is adjustable , i'd honestly rather have a big 2  .

5 viewfinder , like the competition does  .

canon needs to rethink this point , imho .

i do not own a digital slr , but i wanted a camera with features that are similar to an slr , without the cost or complexity  .

lets face it , unless you plan on changing lenses to suit specific applications , a digital slr can be a bit of a waste , given the capabilities of cameras like the s3  .

a reasonably trained photographer can produce some really good photos with this camera  .

if you reach it's limits , then maybe an slr is in your future , however , you will have a tough time pushing this camera to it's limits another thing i really like about this camera is the video mode , something you will not find in a dslr  .

the quality is really good and it allows you to take a full resolution still anytime you want during a video sequence  .

the audio is actually stereo ; another big bonus which get's it rather close to a low end video camera overall , i think my choice is good  .

i just got the camera last week and i have taken over 300 photos to push it's limits  .

the only thing that i am not happy with is the faux wide mode  .

it's simply a croped image on the same sensor  .

you make it a wide shot by adjusting the zoom of the cropped frame  .

a bit strange and a tacky way to say it's got a wide shooting mode  .

not a show stopper , but definitely false advertising .

i own the s2 is it is not the perfect camera out there as most seem to believe its the best it has one glaring defect    poor focus in low light conditions (others who are intermediate    advanced users have also pointed this out)  .

when you autofocus , the object must be inside the focus box which encompasses only a small portion of the picture although you can move the box around a little bit , you cannot quite move it to the edge to get some difficult angle shots the s3 seems to address this problem with their new 9    point aiaf which is not on the s2 and is supposed to provide excellent focus even when the object is not in the center  .

even lower end models have a multifocus option that the s2 lacks if you have not bought the s2 yet and are deciding b/w s2 and s3 , spending the extra bucks is worth it if u are more than just a novice photographer  .

dasdasdad  .

canon does it again  .

awesome picture quality .

had an epson photopc3000z for 6 yrs and it finally died from too many drops  .

spent months to look for a replacement and found the s3is  .

had been actively using this camera for 2 months  .

it's a great camera price/performance  .

quick from start to click  .

great on battery if you do not use the lcd  .

i never like the idea of recording movie with a digital camera but this one changed my mind  .

the video quality is amazing and it is very easy to use  .

my whole reason for picking the s3 is for the intervalometer but that the only function on the camera that is not worth spending time on  .

still it's a great camera for mom or dad with young kids .

i purchased this camera as a supplement to my point and shoot , mainly for high speed sports work  .

the images at high iso were unusable  .

alas , i will have to go for a true slr .

i purchased this unit approximately three months ago to replace the canon s2 is which i gave to my daughter  .

the subtle upgrades (not major by any standards    realistically) are welcomed , but im not so sure that the price differential for the new unit is worth the extra cost  .

(see review at http  //www  .

dpreview  .

com/) the picture quality is definitely outstanding when outside in well    lit areas , but there are some problems with indoor shots  .

i have adjusted various settings and read the manual extensively , but still the problem persists with indoor low    lighting shots  .

the other major issue in my opinion stems from the fact that the straight edges of objects at the telephoto end of the spectrum tend to be wavy in pictures  .

this is not an issue with the s2 is based on experimentation with both units  .

at full zoom , i took shots of a vehicle license plate , and the edges of the plate were very wavy (almost distorted in appearance) on the s3 is version but perfectly straight on the s2 is version  .

similarly , i took a zoomed shot of a street sign and the same issue is pronounced when considering the s3 is unit  .

i contacted canon regarding this issue  .

the representative asked me to turn of the is and take the shots again using a tripod which i did for both the license plate and the street sign  .

the same wavy    line anomaly manifested in the s3 is pictures  .

i called canon to discuss this issue , and i is told that there would probably be a firmware upgrade to deal with this issue  .

as of the date of this writing (08    18    2006) , no firmware upgrade has been announced  .

if anyone reading this review doubts the validity of the information shared in this review , i implore you to conduct your own tests to confirm the problem with the s3 is  .

irrespective of this unfortunate glitch with the unit at the telephoto end of the lens , the s3 is produces excellent pictures in well    lit areas  .

so , if youre using the unit outside and in well    lit areas for the most part and not really using the zoom capability , then youll love this camera  .

on the contrary , if youre going to be taking many zoom or low    light shots , then youre going to be a bit disappointed  .

regardless of these issues (which will hopefully be addressed in a firmware upgrade by canon) , i would have to recommended the camera for purchase based on my own experiences with getting high    quality images  .

the colors are on the mark , the sharpness of the images are on the mark , and there are no noticeable problems with fringing or softness on the edges of images  .

in closing , i would like to state that i do not feel this unit is worth the extra cost given that the s2 is produces equivalent images on all points aforementioned  .

best of luck to all in your search for a good camera , and i hope that this review proves beneficial in your decision    making process regarding the canon s3 is .

canon's entire line of s_ is series cameras were by no means low cost cameras  .

inexplicably , they do not have a date/time stamp option  .

this is very annoying as i used to use this feature all the time on a kodak camera i bought about 5 years ago  .

why do higher end cameras like these lack such a basic feature found in very inexpensive cameras  .

does anyone know why  .

canon salespeople have no explanation  .

i have owned an s1 is for nearly two years , and is always pleased with it  .

naturally i thought that the s3 would be a quantam leap above the s1  .

i is going from a 3  .

1mp 10x optical to a 6mp 12x , not to mention all the other improvements and modifications  .

the first day i owned the s3 i took over 200 photos  .

i had run up 6902 pictures total on my old canon  .

i had expected a massive increase in picture quality with this new model , but what i got is something far more modest  .

i developed 30 of the new photos , and saw no visible difference between these and my dinosaur 3  .

1mp  .

i thought it is just me , so i asked for a second and third opinion  .

i took in the new photos , and stacked them alongside the old to show some co    workers  .

from two different people , i recieved the opinion that there is virtually no difference  .

they were only able to succesfully pick out the photos from the new camera 8 out of 25 times  .

i should note that these photos were the same tpye (landscape) and taken under the same conditions as the ancient s1 other than the seemingly lack of image quality improvement , the camera is obviously far ahead of the s1  .

the stabilization seems better , the movie mode is much easier to use , the grip is easier to handle , the media used is better (the old s1 used cf) , and obviously the mp have doubled since the dino camera s1  .

when i look at the s1 now , i am actually wondering if i needed to upgrade my camera  .

it is a fine camera for it's day , and still is if i compare the s3 1s to other cameras in this price range , i would have to say it is better feature for feature  .

i considered the new sony h5 , but have read there is no continuious shooting mode and only 24x total zoom  .

other cameras have similar shortcomings and so the canon wins in the category of a new mega    zoom point and shoot .

i know i'm going to receive ridiculous comments from those of you who are canon apologists (and employees) , criticizing this review so save your breath  .

this is my third canon camera (owned two digital elphs before  .

i also own the canon mp810 printer (which is fantastic) so i do believe in the canon brand  .

i'm not a professional photog but more of a hobbiest so wanted to buy something that could take quality photos to hang up in my apartment  .

i decided to upgrade to what i thought is a prosumer camera but is very disappointed in the s3  .

for the $400 dollar price and 6 megapixel specs , i expected the photos to be crystal clear  .

anything but  .

the camera has problems focusing correctly in indoor situations where there are multiple lighting conditions (e  .

grand central station in nyc)  .

the flash is little help past 5 meters  .

the night shots are atrocious  .

even at the highest iso , there's a tremendous amount of noise  .

example    i took 150 pics of a lake scene just after dusk to capture a small amount of natural sunlight at various settings  .

none of these photos were usable because of the digital noise  .

the 2 inch lcd is of little use in the field to pick up the noise and any flaws in your shots  .

many of my pics look great in the lcd until i get home and download them to my 20 inch lcd where the defects are apparent  .

my digital elph 450 actually takes crisper , and more natural looking shots  .

is a big fan of the canon brand but very disappointed in this product .

we own two powershot s3 is cameras which were purchased late in 2006 (one we purchased and one we received as a gift)  .

one month ago the lens on one of the cameras jammed while retracting  .

yesterday , the lens on the other camera jammed  .

neither camera had been abused in any way this is apparently a fairly common problem it is unfortunate because we had been generally pleased about the performance of the s3 is model prior to the failures  .

the camera has excellent picture quality and we were also pleasantly surpised by its video capabilities  .

the camera also has enough advanced features to keep a serious hobbyist fully engaged  .

in other words , it is a camera that one could grow into , without having to spring for a digital slr the only real cons to the camera , other than the serious defect described above , is its somewhat slow shutter speed (we have an 19 month old and miss quite a few pictures while waiting for the camera to take the picture after the trigger is depressed)  .

also , if you are looking for a simple point and shoot camera , the s3 is may prove to be too bulky and weighty for your needs .

i like the camera but indoor shots are very important to me  .

they seems to either slightly blurry or the color seems just a bit off  .

in september i upgraded from my olympus c4000 which takes awesome indoor shots  .

if anyone has suggestions i'm open to them otherwise i'm thinking of purchasing a used panasonic fz5 to use for indoors .

i use this along with my nikon d40  .

that camera is great , but the lenses are prohibitive , so i purchased the canon for long shots  .

between the two i have everything i could want .

i is an owner of the canon s    2 and from what i can gather the s    3 is the s    2 in black with a larger screen  .

i found the s    2 to have all the bells and whistles , but the camera let me down when it counted    focusing and quality of image  .

the s    2 is not my first digi    cam and i have been involved in amateur photography for most of my life  .

prior to the s    2 , i had a konica minolta z2 , and prior to that the s    2 failed in auto    focus in hazy condition  .

a three day trip down the yangtze required me to use manual focus for nearly 90% of the images  .

the canon would just search and never find the focus  .

the quality of the images also were not nearly as crisp as with the older z2  .

they were down right soft  .

i ditched the s    2 on ebay and bought the sony h    5 canon spent too much effort on the video mode , sacrificing the basics of the camera .

owning the s2 almost a year now it just jammed 2 weeks ago for not specific reason    being hit/dropped etc  .

look up e18 errors on all canon units here    .

then consider if this great camera is worth the chance  .

i think i am looking at sony  .

believe it or not , this camera will not print the date on the picture  .

i used this camera for couple of months here are my observations 1  .

fast focus lense 2  .

fast operation  .

cheap construction  .

poor grainy pictures  .

blurry , outof focus pictures 6  .

battery compartment cover is really cheap  .

almost unusable (even with flash) in low light situations i finnaly sold it on ebay and bought the panasonic dmcfz50k which is much better digicam this just my humble opinion  .

i am sure there are people who will disagree with me .

i bought the s2is three months ago , near christmas , as it is coming down in price  .

i could smell something is coming up but being a rational consumer , it is a good buy since it is far less expensive than when it first came out  .

at that time , i knew that there is nothing better than the s2is and i is right i find that to use the full features of any camera , memory is the most important thing you will need  .

i have taken top notch pictures that are nearly 3mb with the s2is so you can do the math  .

unless if you have a large budget for extra memory (even possibly needing faster memory cards) for the 60fps video , and the extra mp this camera provides for a little nudge in resolution , it would be a waste of money  .

if you like shooting widescreen movies , an extra 0  .

2 larger screen and additional shooting features (which could be reproduced in photoshop) , this is more ideal for you  .

higher iso speed is handy but to me not a priority as i said , being a rational consumer at this point , i would consider what the utility of a few extra features are for an extra $100 to $150 dollars and taxes  .

this camera has not caught my attention as the s2is first did when compared to the s1is .

so those who have a s1is wish they had waited for the s2is and now those who bought an s2is wish they had waited for the s3is  .

very small improvements basically the same money  .

i do love my s2is but i'm really hoping that with this black body on the s3 that canon is now making their converters in silver instead of last years black  .

cannot you just imagine that the creative folk at canon will make next years s4is with 12x zoom , 7 megapixels , and 1000 iso  .

i wonder what would be wrong with getting it right the first time and sticking with it  .

ohhhh that's right , marketing i almost forgot updated  .

on nov 10 , 2010  .

i found this camera to be a waste of money and replaced it after 12 months use  .

the camera suffers from an identity crisis , not good enough to be a dslr replacement and not compact enough to be convenient  .

i am an experienced photographer and thought this might be a useful addition to my kit  .

now i struggle to find a use for it as it does nothing exceptionally well  .

the camera is not for people with sizeable hands , buttons and knobs are tricky to operate quickly and badly placed  .

using the zoom is a major pain as you cannot zoom and keep your finger in the shutter release at the same time so often you miss the shot  .

the lens cap is just ridiculous and falls off frequently  .

image quality is ok but autofocus performance is poor  .

build quality is not good , drop this camera and the soft plastic will scratch , crack or break , overall the camera just does not feel like its been assembled to high standards  .

i have owned 8 different canon's over the years from compacts to slr's and am frequently left dissapointed by them , this will be my last .

i urge you to do research on canon cameras before you purchase  .

had i known the vast number of people complaining about them , i would have never bought this  .

currently mine is being sent back , yet again to canon  .

they have had so much trouble and outcry with their lenses , there is even an e18 error website www  .

e18error  .

com  .

e18 is the error code that pops up when the lens cannot extend or retract  .

in closing buy a fuji  .

i had a 2 mega pixel camera that made descent 8 x 10 enlargements  .

i wanted something that would give me 20 x30 enlargements , roughly 3 times 8 x 10  .

so i went with a 6 mega pixel camera  .

at almost 80% of 11 x14 (about 9 x12  .

5 ) it did not do the main thing i wanted it to do  .

make my best pictures enlargeable (if that is a word) i'm sorry to say i will be returning it tomorrow it just seems odd that you can do no better than 80% or what they tell you , you should expect .

i'm very upset that my camera broke within one week  .

i went to turn it on one evening and nothing happened  .

i tried new batteries designed for high power devices like canon recommened and still nothing  .

now i have to send back my new camera , my new batteries and my new battery charger  .

they'll have it for about 2    3 weeks  .

i'm not happy that i paid all that money and i'm having to send it in to get fixed already .

i think you are very biased toward canon products    makes me wonder if some kind of insentives are not involved from canon  .

s3is   small bump in megapixels , no increase in zoom  .

6 megapixels is an improvement over 5 , but not a huge jump  .

if there is no g 6 or pro 1 successor which now seems to be the case , the s3 is seems like that it would take over as the flagship of the point and shoots  .

i is expecting 7 megapixels  .

granted 12x optical zoom is a lot , but 14x or 15x doesnt seem an unreasonable upgrade  .

iso 800 is nice , but this has been in other models for 2 years  .

hardly on the cutting edge .

what can i say , i got this as a mid step between my normal 7mp point and shoot camera and a digital slr  .

i read the reviews and thought this would be a good choice  .

my intent is to start posting pictures for stock photo sites but so far i have had nothing but problems getting the quality of picture that i need to post  .

what i should of done is left this on the shelf and gotten the rebel xti  .

the s3is lacks manual controls , and talk about visual noise in the pictures , even in daylight this camera can not get rid of the noise at the highest quality setting even shooting at 100 iso  .

i did pick up almost every add on for this camera as i really wanted to use it  .

turns out that it is a waste of money  .

this camera should of been posted with a warning that it won't take a good quality picture  .

i have a panasonic 7mp that takes better quality pictures than this and it's a standard point and shoot  .

if you are thinking of getting this or the s5is as a middle stepping stone camera do not  .

just spend the extra and get the rebel xti  .

otherwise there are a multitude of point and shoot cameras that will do a better job for you .

i spent a lot of time searching for the right camera , and the s3 is seemed to have it all  .

i read shining upon shining review , but did not do a google search for specific s3 is defects , problems , etc  .

big mistake  .

i is blinded by all the reviews and kudos i is reading i ordered the s3 from amazon and the problems began as soon as i took it out of the box  .

there is something loose and moving around inside the camera , i went online and saw that several other s3 owners had the exact same problem i put the batteries in to test the camera , and it seemed to be working okay , until i transferred some test images to my pc  .

i have been taking photos for 20+ years and i do not take crooked shots    some of the pictures were without doubt slanted to the left  .

i googled and found other s3 owners complaining of the same problem , which seems to be a factory defect    the ccd is misaligned next problem i found is terrible color fringing , also known as chromatic aberration  .

in areas where there is light/dark contrast , violet and green lines were seen along the entire length other issues i noticed about the s3 and read about from owners    .

focus problems , bad low light abilities , clicking sounds from the lens , mushy buttons , barrel distortion , redeye , plastic tripod mount , 1gb movie limit regardless of memory card size , and a cheap lens cap that can come off too easily  .

some users used their s3 to take dozens of pictures , and had memory card errors wipe out all their photos ; this is not due to faulty memory cards i'm not a professional photographer , and did not buy the s3 expecting professional quality photos    but these are problems one might expect to encounter with a $99 camera , not a $300+ model , and not from a trusted canon the name canon always meant quality to me  .

unfortunately things have changed and companies are cutting back on their build quality and quality control to cut costs  .

because of this brands that used to be the best , are now pumping out some of the worst products ever some s3 owners have no complaints , it seems you have to get lucky , if i want to gamble i'll go to vegas  .

it's frustrating that i now have to go and find another comparable camera to replace the s3  .

one owner told of his journey to several stores to test different s3's  .

in over a dozen tests , only one of them had none of these issues although i love the features , and got a few decent shots with it , i cannot accept all the faults  .

i have packed the camera up and am shipping it back to amazon for a refund hope this helps you in getting the right camera , the first time .

this is my first digital camera purchase and the results were not good i searched the reviews and did my homework before making a decision to purchase the canon s3is  .

based on the feature set and what i read online i decided that the s3is is the camera to buy i took the camera to my daughters soccer game to try it out for the first time and shot well over 80 pictures at the game  .

everything seemed to be working fine and i is impressed with the camera's zoom capabilities , image stabilization and it's ability to capture action shots the next time i got ready to use the camera a memory card error message came up on the screen and it never worked past that point  .

i replaced the 1gb memory card i had in the camera with the memory card that came with the camera and still received the same memory card error when the memory card fails you loose all of the pictures stored on the card  .

fortunately all of my pics had been downloaded to my computer after the soccer game i did a google search on the canon memory card error to see if others were experiencing the same problem and there are plenty of other unhappy customers that have experienced the same problem with various canon cameras  .

according to what i have read online canon is aware of the problem but their customer service is terrible  .

just because they are aware of a problem doesn't mean they will do the right thing if you have a problem with a camera you have owned for a while  .

if you buy this camera get it from a reputable dealer and get an extended warranty that will replace the camera if it fails  .

i purchased a 3 year replacement warranty butterfly photo customer service has been excellent and they had no problem replacing the camera  .

i did have to pay $25  .

00 to ship the camera back to butterfly in order to get a new camera back in time for halloween after reading about the canon cameras and memory card failures online i requested that butterfly send me the new kodak p712 instead of the canon s3is but they do not stock the kodak p712 at this time  .

the new p712 has very similar features and capapbilities to the s3is and it's getting decent reviews i will see how the repalcement s3is works out but i am skeptical at this point and loosing pictures due to mfg issues is not something i wish to deal with .

glowing reviews convinced me this is the best buy   a week away in a game reserve produced nothing but disappointing pictures  .

colours were erratic and often over exposed ; images were blurred even with image stabiliser and the camera had difficulty focussing on the subject  .

the menus proved involved and overly complicated which is an added frustration but despite changing settings our pictures continued to be mediocre  .

compared to our previous kodak dx 6490 this camera is an expensive joke  .

the quality of the pictures is that of a cheap digital camera and this camera is anything but cheap  .

batteries were used up very fast and the lens seemed to be of a v poor quality  .

i is so thankful that i is finally able to take this camera back and purchase the sony h5 which is a brilliant choice  .

rating    two , becaus it's just a marketing hole filler , not visibly better (i tested it) than s2 is  .

as a photo camera s3 brought nothing you couldn'd already find since at least half    an    year in the stores  .

picture quality , stabilizer , sensitivity are rather mediocre comared to sony and panasonic  .

lumix fz7 is as good as the s3 but chaper , lumix fz30 is slightly more expensive but significanly better .

we bought this canon powershot s3 is camera due to your review  .

we could not see clearly in either the display or the peep sight to see the subject we were shooting  .

on computer , it shows an exellent pic , but we were guessing as to where we were shooting  .

returned and were sent another and same problem  .

we must be getting too old to see  .

i is hoping for a bigger screen with more megapixels  .

greens do not look natural but more importantly this model only makes modest gains over the previous model  .

when you look at the competition and they have 3 inch screens with 7  .

2 mp and 1000 iso , it will make you wonder if you actually got the best on the market  .

the sony h5 is a noticeable better product and canon is trying to rest on its laurels .
