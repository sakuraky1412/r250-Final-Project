 you also get upscale features like spoken directions including street names and programmable pois .

 i used to hesitate to go out of my directions but not any more .

 the directions didn't tell me anything i didn't already know after fiddling with it for 10 minutes .

 it also does not offer an option to view the route as a series of turn by turn directions .

 it gives your heading not in terms of degres but only in terms of one of eight directions   .

the widescreen is a plus and i highly recommend it, even though it has the wide screen you can stick it in your back pocket which can be conveniently used for walking directions .

garmin's nuvi 255w   is a handy little device that provides excellent value, but more importantly spot on directions .

 while i recommend that you refrain from entering a directions request while driving your car, i note that some of the more impressive features of this gps are literally one touch away, and so mounting the device close enough to you to activite a one touch feature would seem to be relatively important .

 but leaving it on the seat next to you is likely to cause a few double takes because as comfortable as you think you're going to be just listening for directions, the fact remains that the graphics will attract your eyeballs like a moth to a flame .

 i've found the directions in major metropolitan areas to be excellent .

 but for the most part, we find that the garmin software provides accurate directions, whereever we intend to go .

another screen at the touch of the button will show you the turn by turn directions coming up so that you can plan even better, especially in areas that you have just enough familiarity to be considered dangerous .

i like how the garmin 255w doesn't make you type in complete directions when it isn't necessary .

the only other annoyance of any time is that if you deviate from your route and don't indicate that you are detouring, you get to hear the garmin repeatedly chastize you because it has to recalulate your directions .

 no more firing up the computer, going to the site, printing the directions .

 it speaks the directions so that you don't have to keep looking down at a piece of paper .

 it allows for detours with directions on how to get back .

 saves mobile phone minutes, because you don't have to call and ask for directions .

traffic directions are as good and detailed as can be, as you would expect from a garmin, and less intrusive than on some other brands .

in closing, this is a fantastic gps with some very nice features and is very accurate in directions .

 the sound is tolerable, but when you are hearing spoken directions a lot, it gets really annoying .

 however, the tts gave me few wrong directions during my trip to ny city .

0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, july 6, 2009

 the directions are highly accurate down to a  t  .

 depending on what you are using it for, it is a nice adjunct to a travel trip and the directions are accurate and usually the quickest, but not always .

 i tend to be a technological idiot but i figure this out, right out of the box and i hadn't even read the directions yet, , this is major easy .

 gives you immediate directions to get to the location you chose to set up as your home location .

 allows you to type in two street names, and if they intersect, the gps unit will give you directions to that intersection .

 you can touch anywhere on the map and press go for directions to that location .

 shows you your current latitude and longitude location, and allows you to enter new coordinates to set up so you can get directions to that location .

 if you missed the spoken directions, you can look at the top of the screen for written directions .

 however, i much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .

some of the verbal directions :

 it should tell me to take the southwest drive exit, or the buffalo gap road exit, like the highway sign says, or like i would verbally tell someone to take if giving them directions .

 so, although the nuvi doesn't verbalize those directions, i can look at the screen to see the exit i need to take .

directions seemed to focus on interstate travel and i have not played with the device enough to know if it can be set to avoid interstates .

it lost satellite contact a couple of times on the trip   but apparently picked them up again because there were no skipped directions .

directions were easy to see and understand .

 the spoken directions are generally easy to understand .

 since the directions are also displayed on the screen, i find the occasional mispronunciation entertaining and not an issue .

 it does know when you are not near a public road but it cannot give directions to the road .

 the spoken turn, by, turn directions are clear and very timely .

 my only real gripes on the software interface side would be its inability to show 1, way streets on your overhead map   and that this particular model does not support the garmin routing feature that you can sync between your pc and their more expensive models to pick multiple waypoints instead of just a point 'a' to point 'b' directions system .

 you can even get turn, by, turn directions from the program, and google maps has features that work with garmin units .

 any time you're facing a closed roadway or are terribly stuck in highway traffic, you'll get a very slick change in directions to your destination given to you in literally less than 5 seconds than you ask for it .

 button, and it gave us directions right to carmel .

  the purpose of the gps is to give me directions in unfamiliar locations .

the voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .

it takes a little while to get the satellites sometimes, but i just set it up as soon as i get in the car and by the time i'm out on the road and actually need directions it's up and going .

 i had a great time torturing the poor thing and deliberately not following its directions while driving one day in downtown sacramento .

as with the 285wt, it gave me bad directions in one place in sacramento .

 i avoided the more complex ones as i had read that fm updates can confuse the device and changing directions after the obstruction has been cleared is not a good option .

i like being able to select different voices, however when i am using daniel with the english accent, he seems to be clearing his throat at the end of his directions .

 it loads quickly, have pretty accurate directions, and can recalculate quickly when i miss a turn .

 often when i'd get a phone call or was talking to someone, it would have been nice to just have the ability to quickly make the voice directions mute .

 the directions were pretty right on, with a brief glitch with the distance it was calculating for some approaching streets .

 i am sure i've not even touched upon the many features this gps boasts, but for basic travel directions for the non, techie then this is a great product .

 my daughter would then call my wife, asking her to plot a course using a mapping web site and recite the directions .

 daughter dearest now carries the nuvi in the glove box of her car, pulling it out, plugging it in, and getting directions whenever she needs, in a manner that notably is much faster and clearer than reading a map or calling her mother .

 when it comes to directions, i'm horrible .

 there are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even australian, american and british english .

 i mainly bought the first one for my wife since she needs directions alot of the time .

 it worked so well that people from the wedding were following me for directions .

 in the week that i have had it, it's been spot on in providing directions and keeps up with the speed i am traveling .

 the voice prompted turn by turn directions make it easy to get from one place to another without having to look up at the gps, but of course you also get turn, by, turn directions on the gps with a touch of the screen .

 amazon had the best price for this model which i chose for its ability to adjust the directions if you reroute, text to speech feature and 4 .

for the first time in several years, my husband & i took a roadtrip with no  squabbling  about directions .

 directions and maps are easy to use, and if you miss a turn, it updates your route in seconds .

 it has worked well for local driving giving accurate directions for roads and streets .

 i was so tired of having to go to mapquest and print out directions .

 the voice directions give you fair warning when you are about to take a turn, which is really important .

what the 255w does best is find a street address, business, point of interest, hospital or airport and give you turn, by, turn directions with amazing accuracy .

 i would have struggled to find with my usual combination of maps and web, based directions .

 the directions the gps gave me were absolutely correct  , but the name of the highway was wrong .

 wish i had bought it about two years ago rather than spend a lot on maps and wasting time asking directions, especially in relatively remote areas of me .

 i spent 2 weeks driving around the mid, west following mapquest maps and directions .

 i chose small towns as destinations and it always led me there without any problems, thus allowing me to enjoy the scenery of the fall foliage without worrying about using a map for directions or getting lost .

 i use the map feature when i don't need directions which makes it easier to identify streets when street signs are obscured or missing  .

on the negative side, the directions it gives to a given address are not always the best way to get there .

0 out of 5 stars myon, stardirectionsreplacementunit, october 15, 2009

my new garmin 255w had very easy set up, accurate directions to locations, user friendly unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .

 this unit has replaced my gm on, star directions unit in my vehicle .

 directions routing are perfect .

 spoken directions are crystal clear .

 practiced visiting places i already knew to see how accurate the directions and maps would be .

 the directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .

 no more stopping at so and so gas stations for directions .

 map is bright and detailed, voice directions are clear and loud  .

 it can be a little distracting the first few times you use it, but once you find the right mounting spot, it s like it's not there until you need it and then it's there waiting for you to with all the directions to get you to your destination .

 i had no trouble with the volume level of the spoken directions either and found it to be an interesting and helpful tool .

 several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .

after a certain amount of frustration dealing with paper maps, missed exits and fumbling for directions in the dark ,  i decided it was time to get on the gps car navigation wagon .

 also, there is there no asking for directions from passengers like spouses and children who have difficulty reading conventional paper maps .

others have said that the voice directions leave something to be desired in terms of volume and clarity .

 it was accurate on determing original directions and recalculating when necessary .

 but driving on the highway with music on and windows down, it will be hard to hear the directions using just 70% of volume .

 i didnt know the address of the mueseum so i typed it into the unit and it found not only the meuseum, but the nearest garage, the places to eat, and directions were right on .

the display is very easy to read, and the directions were very good .

 the model 255w that we received seemed to take longer to find a satelite, and the man's voice was very fast and not as clear, and at times seemed a bit confused in directions .
