back for the fifth time - we love this place , it is like coming home every year and now it has gotten even better than before .
since last year there has been some long overdue renovations to the rooms and pool area which is great !
the staff are like they used to be some 4-5 years ago - very friendly and helpful .
big thank you to jasmine who was just gorgeous ( again ) .
lanna mantra obviously has new management who has lifted the standards a great deal , and this is what it needed desperately .
we nearly did n't stay there this year as we were so disappointed with the standard of everything last year but really glad we did come back .
obviously standards in monaco must be very different but i love the lanna feel of this place , it is peaceful , authentic , casual and comfortable without being pretentious .
do n't stay here if you want luxury and noisy and busy but if you want to relax and feel like you are on a holiday definitely give this place a go .
it takes about 10 minutes to get into town at a cost of about 150 baht but you get to go back to the tranquility of the river setting away from the noise .
do n't tell too many people about it though - we do n't want it to become too busy and popular .
congratulations to management on the improvements - we will be back . . .
