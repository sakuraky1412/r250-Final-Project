Pros:. It is a given that once a hardrive is formatted it never has same space left to write on. One should always look at X-Gigs less formatting cluster size. (500 Gig minus Format writing) Although I agree it shouldn't take 40 gigs away from hardrive size. 
Cons:. Didn't care for the WD External Hardrive Crash after I backed up my computers internal hardrive to it after powering it down and it couldn't be read afterwords by my computer as it said it was all corrupted files.. 
Summary:. I used a file retrieval program to get back all my files and pictures which I was afraid was totally gone when it crashed as I had scanned thousands of pictures that are totally irreplaceable from my childhood till to date, that would have been gone forever. However I did retrieve everything. I reformatted my drive again after the retrieval and I have had no problems with it since, (knock on wood) for the past 7 months. However being an older person I have learned that to buy anything today is taking a chance as no matter how far we have come to in advancements, the quality of todays mass produced products are a roll of the dice at best. Products are not made to last as they were in my era as everything depends on sales, sales, sales, money, money, money, greed, greed, greed. It is not about the consumer it is all about the almighty dollar and how quickly and how much the corporations can make it.. However the demand is great and people are to quick to purchase without doing their homework so I guess we are just as guilty. Remember in life, you get what you pay for and buyer beware. If this is done there would be less crying about how you were taken...you let yourselves be taken.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple design, easy set up, good size.. 
Cons:. Sometimes a little sluggish.. 
Summary:. This a good product. it is simple, not a big space hog, and large amount of space to save your information. Don't move it a lot or it can cause hardware failure ( I did and i had to send it in for an exchange). 

$$;
Pros:. Owned 2 yrs. Once, I knocked it off my desk onto a hardwood floor. The plastic case came loose but snapped back in place and not one bit of data lost! It's been 2500 mi. in a hot car trunk. What more can you ask of a drive? Recommend highly!!. 
Cons:. Haven't found any cons.. 
Summary:. I can't speak to the Seagates - haven't owned one. But I would, I do, and I am recommending the Western Digital to friends and family. -- retired programmer/analyst. 

$$;
Pros:. Dependable, Simple to Use. 
Cons:. No Cons to Note. 
Summary:. I have had this drive for several months now and I have not had any problems at all. It is a great simple plug and play drive for anyone that needs additional storage. I have it plugged into a battery backup in case of power failure. I never have any issue transferring or accessing data even after long periods of not using it. Overall Great drive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, and very low heat generated,. 
Cons:. None that I can think of.. 
Summary:. Over the last year, I've purchased ten of these units. Each and every one of them worked great out-of-the-box. I've so far used these drives on a Dell Optiplex with built-in USB 2.0, as well as a Dell Optiplex with an Adaptec USB 2.0 PCI card.. I don't understand why some people have problems with this drive. Some tips I'll offer: 1) Don't use USB hard drives off a USB hub. Hard drives need as much power and bandwidth off the USB bus as possible. 2) Format the drive to either FAT32 or NTFS before use. Even if the drive comes pre-formatted, format it anyway. 3) Make sure the drive is connected to a USB 2.0 port. Hard drives connected to a USB 1.x port simply doesn't work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Status light, Quiet, Cool, Cheap. 
Cons:. For my needs none!. 
Summary:. I have recently set up a Windows Home Server (RC1) on an old computer of mine. With this easy to use software I can connect all of my computers to it and have complete back ups made in a snap! Microsoft did a good job here! All I had to do was plug the drive in and the Home Server set everything else up. If I need more storage I just simply add another one. Its cheap, sleek, cool (tempreture wise) and to this point in time stable! I have no real need for high speed since I am operating most of my computers over WIFI.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price &#38; Speed. 
Cons:. No problems detected. 
Summary:. This drive has performed outstandingly since attaching it to both my server and also swapping onto my laptops. All computers have acknowledged the drive immediately and has given no failures. The speed of the drive is consistent and exceedingly fast, through a USB 2.0 interface. The drive is backwards compatible to USB 1 but always double check that your USB is "enhanced" (2.0) ..otherwise the best suggestion is to install a nominal 2.0 add-on card. Most problems arise from this oversight. Best Buy ran this drive for over $100 off it's regular price which brought down to $190 .. it's an outstanding drive and an outstanding deal. It's extermely quiet both horizontal and vertical, venting heat efficiently.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is an utterly reliable and unremarkable external hard drive. I've had one for almost two years, and it has performed flawlessly the entire time.. 
Cons:. None - it works.. 
Summary:. First thing I did was to reformat it into NTFS so that it could hold large files - since then I haven't had to do a thing with it.... 

$$;
Pros:. Works...... 
Cons:. FAT32??? What were they thinking?. 
Summary:. Works: very fast and its nice looking.If you're smart you would know it's best to format it to HFS+ if you're using a Mac. It boosts the speed by a lot.. 

$$;
Pros:. all good here, no problemos!. 
Cons:. none for me, nothings perfect!. 
Summary:. I have owned my 500Gb WD for some time now.. As far as I am concerned, it is well worth the money.. I suppose it depends upon what you expect and or use an external hard drive for, as to whether you would be satisfied with this drive.. For me it rates 10 out of 10, excellent.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Setup in 5 min.. 
Cons:. Slow in backing up. 40 min. to backup 7.4GB.. 
Summary:. After using this hard drive for a few days it works great. I backup my XP Then put it on my Vista &#38; up loaded my vids &#38; photos to it.Interface easy to use.Though slow, I am happy with my purchase.It has 30 day trail Auto Backup which works perfectly. Gladly pay small fee. Turn PC on &#38; it works silently in the background.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Capacity - Low Cost - Good Speed!. 
Cons:. 500 GB is really 465 GB - I'm running out of USB ports!. 
Summary:. I download/upload a ton of items directly to/from these drives and they work flawlessly. Those comments stating that they didn't work or failed are most likely due to the users inability to plug it in because that is about how simple it is to use. I reformatted my drives from FAT32 to NTFS before using them which is recommended for drives of this size. You can't go wrong with this drive. I won't be able to buy many more since I'm running out of USB ports! Note that the way Western Digital calculates disk space results in these being 465 GB drives. There are lawsuits against them for not disclosing this up front to buyers, however, that has not stopped me from purchasing them since they work great and still provide a ton of disk space for the money. Best Buy just had these on sale last weekend 6/16/2007 for $129.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large size, nice look, easy to install.. 
Cons:. None that I can see. 
Summary:. This is just a big external hard drive. It does what it says. 500 gb of extra room. Even though it is USB, I don't find it to be all that slow and I am a very impatient person. It was extremely easy to install. I just plugged it in and then started using it. I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. 500 Giga reasons to buy it. 
Cons:. automatic on function. 
Summary:. I like the way it looks. It doesn't require any attachments to stand vertically. It works flawlessly with Vista. I would have given 10 out of 10 but there is 1 thing I didn't like about this device; It turns on by itself when the PC is turned on.It would be better if this was optional.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup (just plug it in), good price, solid construction. 
Cons:. Tends to turn itself on. 
Summary:. The first thing I did upon recieving my "My Book" was to remove the WD junk software that was included. I hate storage devices that come with software and the WD-My Book cleaned up nicely. I have been using this device for months now and I have 288 gb of data stored on it without issue. After clearing off the included software, the next thing I did was to transfer approx. 160gb of data. Data transfer went smoothly and the device did not become excessively hot as others often do. I travel with the My Book quite often and have dropped it on several occasions, yet it continues to perform. My only complaint would be that even when the power button is pressed to turn it off, the device tends to turn itself back on. I can confidently say that the WD-My Book is one of the best computer hardware purchases i've ever made.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size, Relatively quick, Looks nice. 
Cons:. Cheap platic case, FAT32 standard, Power button too easy to hit. 
Summary:. I've had the drive for a little over a week and am very impressed by it. It is sleek, worked like a charm via Plug n Play and massive.. While it is true that it is a little slow when transfering large files. So if you are planning on moving DVD backups or anything in that size range from your local hard drive to the external hard drive often expect it to take roughly 5 minutes.. On the other hand I have moved all of my music files to the drive and when in iTunes the seek times are amazing. Sometimes it feels like it's playing the next song before I click next.. One thing I did not like about this drive is that the case is a very thin cheap plastic material and does not look as good as in the pictures (things rarely do). The drive still looks good compared to others in the market today.. Also the power button on the front is a little too easy to push or hit accidentally. I've had a couple instances where I've been shuffling things around on my desk and powered down the drive by accident.. For ~$230 it's a hell of a drive. Would definitely recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Able to stream movies without interruption. 
Cons:. None that I know of. 
Summary:. I am very impressed with this storeage device. It was plug and play on my system and I modified the storeage settings by reading the online turtorial in minutes.. I have ripped my DVD collection to the device and have not experienced any problems. In fact, I am stunned by the product. It looks great and operates great. I have been watching movies over my network and cannot tell that I am watching a stored copy. To top it all off I purchased the drive for $199 at Best Buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Runs relativly cool, it's quiet and fast, good price, bundled Google utilities. 
Cons:. minor complaints: formatted with FAT32, a little bulky compared to some. 
Summary:. I bought this drive so I can rip my CD collection to high-quality MP3 files. It's set up to go out of the box and comes with Google's Picasa, and Western Digital should probably look into bundling an MP3 management program (like Monkey) with this drive. I don't like that it comes formatted with FAT32 (although of course this is more compatible with various OS's). Isn't pretty much any Windows user buying this using XP?. Aside from that, the drive is very fast...much faster than the other external hard drives I have, including another Western Digital drive. I like the fact that it shuts itself off with the computer.. I got this for $133 (250GB version) at Sam's Club, and that's pretty good considering a bare drive that size plus a cheap enclosure will set you back nearly that much anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Stylish, Quiet. 
Cons:. Non-Removable HD. 
Summary:. I've owned a few external drives and this is my favorite by far. It's quiet, powers itself on and off (so no pesky on/off switch), has a smaller power brick than most, looks good sitting on your desk and is fast. Especially great as a multimedia drive (I use this with my Media Center Edition to record TV).. The only downside is that you can't crack the case and swap drives, which isn't really something most consumers will be doing anyway.. The Essential Edition is perfect for those that don't really need the glowing disk space gauge of the Pro edition and like myself already have more than enough USB and Firewire ports on every other device.. 

$$;
Pros:. quiet, huge capacity, elegant design. 
Cons:. slightly expensive. 
Summary:. This HD is honestly the best external HD I have encountered. Plug and play, it is lightning fast and almost completely silent. Easy to use and to stow. I'd recommend it over any of the competition, especially Seagate, which has given me way too many problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Worked as plug and play. Easy to copy enormous files to (photos, PowerPoint and Itune music collection).. 
Cons:. No real directions. Have to plug in AC.. 
Summary:. I purchased this to back up my remote drive. I don't save anything except programs to hard drive. Worked like a charm, but has only the simplest graphical pix. Copied tons of file like a charm.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet, Stylish. 
Cons:. No carrying case. 
Summary:. I immediately transfered my mp3s, movies, psp games and other documents and it went smoothly. So far, I don't have any problems with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap, pretty quiet. 
Cons:. stupid light flashes all night.... 
Summary:. its pretty difficult finding reputable 500gb internal drives let alone a usb drive. to be honest i didnt really feel like putting one in my computer anyway although im sure im capable... i think.... i got this for $139 at CC. was this or the Seagate. the Seagate was 159. I don't want to use any backup software, so I dont know if im missing anything, but this thing works right out of the box.. I plugged it in so I could move stuff off my FULL 160GB internal to do my yearly reformat.. Its quieter than my internal drive which i LOVE. One thing i HATE about it though is when its connected the lime green light flashes all freaking night long, i dont really wanna ELECTRICAL TAPE the sucker but i just might have to.. I changed the Volume Label to "BLACKBOX," that was pretty neat.. I had to do some research to figure out how to change the filesystem from FAT32 to NTFS without reformatting... worked.. Other than no flashing status lights... only think I would ask for would be a Gigabit LAN port and FTP server and Print Server and UPnP media server... but then I would need to pay like $200 more... and I'll pass.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots a storage space, fast transfer. 
Cons:. on/off thing , PC crosover, esp on new systems. 
Summary:. Alright, so here I am ready to finally write My Mybook review. At this moment I am reformatting the thing b/c it became unrecognized with my new computer. So am I here to flame it? No, but I want to inform folks of what happened so as they can hopefully avoid it. This drive is a good drive, it doesnt get to hot even with major transfers. And 1/2 a terrabyte for around $125 avg, what can you complain about. The transfer is fast too! So what happened. I did a new system build. New Mobo with new drivers and unexpectedly plugged add played it onto my new system. I think because of the configuration, the drivers didn't take, and it reformatted it on its own. The stuff was still there, based on scans with data recovery software, and the drive was still healthy via XP dsk management and WD diags, so I must warn, if you pull this baby off one PC onto another, or multiples, be careful and install the WD data software. I've read that some folks remove this stuff, and that may work with single PC setups, but beware with cross overs. Cons? As someone else wrote, the thing will turn itself on every so often, and I think this was part of my reformat issue, so Im gonna keep an eye on it. also the note PC cross over issue, be careful. Lastly, I paid over $200 at staples, b4 meeting the Supreme Newegg, my fault, but even staples had it at half the price a month later, dorsnt it burn you up when this happens!!??. 

$$;
Pros:. looks pretty. 
Cons:. no MFG win98 driver - need to do your own install. 
Summary:. ok win98se peeps ... here's the HOW2. brought to you by ME - just minutes after success installing on windows 98se. Mine was the WD 320gig Essential Ed 2.0. WD My Book Essential Edition 2.0 - win98se ?. no win98se driver. none on web or WD site. here's what I did to get it (the usb hd) to run on windows 98se. 1. after PC was booted to desktop ... plug in USB HD. 2. windows detected &gt; clicked thru the driver install &gt; unknown device. 3. my computer &gt; properrties &gt; device manager - select unkown USB device. 4. properties &gt; reinstall driver. 5. select ... display a list of drivers in a specific location. 6. select from list. 7. select hard drive. 8. select USB ( do not select ... USB Product ). 9. windows 98 message - FOUND wd3200aaj external - installs driver. 10 . check My Computer ... should see (2) new drives appear. * reboot - done. THE DRIVE DOESN'T NEED TO BE FORMATTED. it is already Fat32. it also works plug-n-play with win2K , XP (even as a Fat32). no need to fomat - just dump the oem folders for more space .. - the reasson TWO drives appear instead of ONE is because the. product has an integrated RAID controller ... which causes the. ghost drive to show up . whatever you write to one , shows up on both .. - if you UNPLUG the USB HD while the PC is running ... drive My Book. remains shown but is not there , and the other drive immediately. disappears from the system (as it should) .. PLEASE TAKE NOTE :. any subsequent attempted read/write to the removed USB HD. will blue screen ya . May be best to power down before removal .. and they said it couldn't be done .. 

$$;
Pros:. Lot of storage good transfer rate.. 
Cons:. Does not like being on a crowded power strip will not be recognized by windows and you will think that you lost your data on it!. 
Summary:. If it fails on you unplug it from the crowded power strip and plug it into one that does not have any thing pluged into it and you will be back up and running!. 

$$;
Pros:. simple to hook up and use.. 
Cons:. No back up software, only worked for a year. Poor support.. 
Summary:. I bought the 400gb version almost a year ago to the day. When it worked, it worked pretty well. when shutting down, you had to go into your task bar and "safely remove hardware" otherwise it wouldnt start up the next time without a battle. Most importantly, there's no back-up software and mine just died within the last couple days. contacted support 4 days ago for some help and still havent heard from them.. I would encourage those looking to vear away from these units. They're just not stable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of space for a good price; Nice-looking stackable case. 
Cons:. Quality control issues; formatted for FAT32 for people still using an antiquated OS. 
Summary:. I bought this drive for only $130. Great deal for 500GB hard drive that you can carry almost anywhere. It did work with a Windows Vista laptop first time around. However, this drive only worked for a day or so, then started exhibiting all sorts of errors. At first, I thought it was a driver problem since I then connected to a machine using a form of Windows Server 2003. Then, I connected it to a Windows XP computer and found the same problems. After only three weeks I had to RMA the drive through Western Digital. Luckily this second drive works well. But only a couple of weeks is not long enough to tell whether something will last.. When you get the drive, you will have to format it to NTFS since it comes formatted as FAT32 which only Win '98 and ME recognize properly.. Updated. on Mar 14, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap price. 
Cons:. cheap quality. 
Summary:. I wasn't expecting a box full of awesome but this thing is seriously bare bones. It's also FAT32 which i neglected to notice. Easy fix, just format it. It's incredibly cheap feeling. I've seen McDonald's toys made of higher quality plastic. Fingers crossed it survives a while. Warranty recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good backup storage good price.. 
Cons:. To try to restore we opened up and pulled disk out. Disk was HOT for &gt; 1 hour (poor ventilation). Disk inside had sticker stating recertified. If the core of the product is recertified they should market as such (not hide it inside an enclosure). 
Summary:. Basically the problem with the product is mine was a recepticle for an unwanted recertified disk. Combine this with poor thermal design (no ventilation and plastic enclosure) and the results is a short expected life. If you buy this to serve as one of multiple backups, you might want to take a chance. If you want a mission critical disk pass on this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design.. 
Cons:. Product failed within 2 months of ownership with a corrupted drive. Only some data was recoverable. WD requires use of their vendors for data recovery, which was inconvenient and time-consuming.. 
Summary:. Will not replace with another WD product.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was pretty darn cheap at Costco, I guess that's the only Pro I can think of.. 
Cons:. Bad software, Problems with Mounting, etc. 
Summary:. Very disappointed with this product. The software for backup that comes with it is clunky and practically useless. Also, we bought a couple at my office two of them didn't work. One would only work with USB, the firewire wouldn't work! The other wouldn't mount at all. Just a junky box lighting up. Don't buy this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Size of HDD, Nice Color &#38; Design. 
Cons:. Forgets it is supposed to hold data for indefinite period of time (or until I delete it myself). Out of box, one of the drives didn't work in less than two days. In 3 weeks, it lost its mind and deleted my server backup. 
Summary:. Don't rely on this product. There are many other decent WD products, this one sucks. "The Safest Place For Your Data" (as the box implies), is on another device. Don't buy this one. WD needs to rework this product. The mini usb port also doesn't seat very well. It would have been nice to also see regular USB with type A and B connector and in the future E-Sata. If you insist on the purchase, then please have a disaster plan in place to recover those beloved pics and mp3's.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing, given out it ended.. 
Cons:. It ate my photographs.. 
Summary:. I've relied on a Western Digital Essentials drive to back up my data since November of 2007. Last week, I backed up some old emails, and all my photographs disappeared or were corrupted. Western Digital will do nothing since the warranty has expired. On one level I get that--warranties expire. But if the warranty on a car, or a toaster, or whatever expires, you can always say, "Well, at least I got to use it during for a certain period of time." But with backup drives, nothing matters but whether the data is there today. Now. And mine is gone, gone, gone. Western Digital got the money; I lost the most important data I entrusted to them, and that is that. Never, ever would I trust a product from this company again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pros... well the price but of course I came to find out that it was too good to be true.. 
Cons:. The read of the files began to be slower and took longer and then all of a sudden these warning pop ups started coming up. When i tried to access files, it wouldn't read them.. 
Summary:. Don't buy it. you lose so much material. Get something else other than a Western Digital.. 

$$;
Pros:. It plugs into a computer.. That is all.. 
Cons:. Absolute worst piece any equipment ever been conned into buying. Big mistake. It useless, unless you like to reboot, wait 20 MINUTES to transfer 500MB and have constantly poor results. Support said DIRECTLY....THEY DO NOT SUPPORT MAC AND DON'T CARE!. 
Summary:. Woo. Bottom line.. I really would love to have some pull in this world. I really wish I wasn't just some guy sitting in my home in some city. I wish I could reach out and scream that I have been fooled. Fooled by a company that says they're progressive and useful. Nope. Useless is my opinion of this gear.. Again, I'm just one customer ( who was told that it's MY COMPUTER that's having this slowdown problem, not the hard drive. Um, my computer is just fine. Ask the 150+ programs I have on it and the 5GIG of RAM that keeps me moving. Or even the fact that my laptop mini hard drive outperforms this machine in every test I have tried. Oh yeah, as I said before.... the CUSTOMER Support ACTUALLY said, ...."We do not support Apple Macintosh products, never stated that we did, and will not attempt to for future designs of this or any other drive.". Essentially, they said f()(k you buddy, you bought it, now live with it.. I'd love to live with it, if I could. Too bad it takes 3-4 attempts to retrieve any info or files from this Western Digital MyBook!. WD MyBook = POOP!. Just my $300 worth of 2 cents.. Garbage.. 

$$;
Pros:. where are the Pros in a drive that eats your data?. 
Cons:. Problems from the very beginning, would never allow to STOP the drive, always had to shut down the computer, then DELAYED WRITE FAILURE and eventually no longer accessible.. 
Summary:. The problems are with the drive itself. I though it might be the controller, or something else with the enclosure, but not so: after I was no longer able to access the drive, I opened the case, took the drive out and installed it in a desktop. It had the same problems as in the enclosure, BUT I was able to copy files from the drive to another drive during the first few minutes after switching on the computer. So I opened the PC case and put a fan right in front of the drive AND IT WORKED!!! So there is an overheating problem! With enough cooling, the drive was still working and I was able to recover all my data before throwing it into the trash!. NEVER WD MyBooks again! No matter how cheap! You don't even get what you pay for!. 

$$;
Pros:. Smallish and therefore easy to throw into a brief case. Turn off automatically - bla bla bla. 
Cons:. units fail - simple as that. These units can only be trusted to fail.. 
Summary:. First I put important business data on one of them. Then i backed it up on another one of them. The third was just for music. The business one failed first, but because I lacked faith i was able to back up the data on another Hard drive.. Next one contained only favorite music that was backed up. However a lot time went into picking out that music. Now i will tear apart the drives and see if i can re-initiate the drive in my computer and use one of them as a secondary internal drive.. Highly recommend not buying these drives. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) Low price. 
Cons:. 1) Drive failed after about a year and a bit. 2) Possible Inadequate cooling?. 
Summary:. I first started seeing intermittent problems with this drive about 6 months ago. I thought that perhaps something was overheating, so I transplanted the enclosed WD hard drive into a Vantec enclosure, and everything worked ok for a while.. All of a sudden a few weeks ago the drive stopped being recognized, and I have had to take it in to a data recovery firm to retrieve the data. It will cost me about $900 CAD to recover the data onto a new drive. It's my own fault for having no usable backup, but nonetheless, I cannot recommend this drive. You get what you pay for.. 

$$;
Pros:. good when it works. 
Cons:. not what it should be. 
Summary:. this drive is great up until the point where it stops working for no reason. I owned this drive for about 1.5 years 3 months of that was spent in storage. I used the drive very lightly and was never rough with it. The other day when i pulled it out to use it all the drive would do is spin up and click, and then shut down. Put on top of this WD's horrible customer support. I have also had many problems with the drive losing all of the data on it before so i think its time to get a much better drive.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice design, and feel. 
Cons:. a bit bulky, no software disc. 
Summary:. this unit lasted less than 24 hrs before crashing, was moving 40 gig package,when unit crashed, followed Manufactures shut down procedure, unit says that unit needs to be formated, loss some files that are now nonrecoverable....my wd 250 oio pocket drive works like a charm,expected the same from my book. 

$$;
Pros:. plug and play. 
Cons:. drive fails, data lost, unrecognized by windows. 
Summary:. was extremely excited about the low price for a 500GB drive. I've had the drive for a few months now. Although drive was a little slow it seemed fine until a week ago when it was no longer recognized by windows. now i've lost data and by the sounds of other reviews WD is not very helpful at resolving this issue either. Doesn't sound like i'm the first this has happened to either.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small and Fairly Light for 500GB. 
Cons:. Cheap plastic case; functioned for two days only. 
Summary:. This drive was too good to be true -- 500GB external drive with a small case and a cheap price. The drive repeatedly malfunctioned when writing -- I tried operating it using usb 2.0 on two different Windows XP boxes.. As a side note, the case while wonderfully small is made of very cheap plastic and has the fit and finish of a product you'd expect to cost $20 -- it's odd to put a 500GB drive in a flimsy plastic case that looks like a toy.. Unplugging power to drive and then reattaching helped a little, but this is just too risky for data. It's like gambling. It repeatedly wasn't recognized as a drive by the computer and had data copy and erase errors.. It took two hours to copy over 400GB of data and then another half hour to do an RMA at buy.com because I couldn't speak to a live person at Western Digital or Buy.com. The phone tree at both locations would require the patience of a monk to navigate over half a day.. I was not once able to stream video or audio using USB 2.0 although I could open several files I copied to the drive.. I was seduced by the price for this size drive, but now I have to wait to get my money back, I wasted hours copying data and I'm going to have to do it all over again. Was it worth saving $100 or $200? No. Unless you are retired and eating out of cans, spend an extra $100 or $200 and save a lot of trouble.. 

$$;
Pros:. None..none and none!!!. 
Cons:. The software update process does not work; WD support is very poor; after inital set up and back up, the hard drive does not work PERIOD!. All the marketing of this product is very misleading. At best the Ext. HD is good as a "drag and Drop" backup.. 
Summary:. It does not function as marketed....no updates/backups after the intial installation. Cannot update the latest firmware and software updates.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was cheap. You get what you pay for. Quick replacement of first bad one. Second one just as bad.. 
Cons:. The salesman talked me into the WD vs. Seagate. I bought it. Lasted for about an hour then died. It was replaced by merely filling out a form online and delivered quickly by UPS.. 
Summary:. All companies have problem products and, although I don't like the inconvenience of having to return a product, Within the first hour of use, the thing died. Knowledge base is terrible. WD's replacement was immediate with no questions asked. That's because it was only an online form. I did think at the time there must be something weird to have an automated return policy. The replacement arrived quickly but it died in the same manner within an hour. I've had it! I guess I'll go back and get a Seagate even though that brand conked out on me but I got about a year out of it. Don't buy this product. Read all the reviews and save yourself the aggrevation.. 

$$;
Pros:. The drive was inexpensive.. 
Cons:. Using Windows Vista Home Premium and Vista Business on 2 different machine, the drive disappears for no apparent reason.. 
Summary:. Western Digital has burned the bridge for me. I'll stick with other brands of hard drives in the future. I bought 3 of these drives, all randomly loose connection and I have to unplug and plug back in to gain access. I can't get one of the drives to reconnect at all, trying it on 3 different computers, both Vista and XP. I can't find update drivers on the WD website. WD was my brand of choice, never again.. 

$$;
Pros:. 500 gig external drive. Easily transfer data between different computers.. 
Cons:. Slower than an internal. 1 year warranty. Product died after 16 months.. 
Summary:. It was an ok drive. The drive should have lasted alot longer. Unit was out of warranty. WD was would not help even with the premature failure and blamed it on the low cost of the drive which offset the longer warranties they offer on others,. 

$$;
Pros:. - cheap. - somewhat stylish. 
Cons:. - fails to mount to system. - power button has a mind of it's own. - turns on even though the computer isn't!. - I lost all my backed-up data due to this product. 
Summary:. Don't buy this product. I'm writing this review since I want to warn others so that they can avoid the mistake I made. I used this product to back-up my data for 2 years. Today, I connected it to my computer (+ two other laptops to make sure) it informed me that in order for me to use it I would had to re-format it!!!! Hence, all my data is lost now. I always make sure that I disconnect the device safely, so that can't be the problem. Also, see 'cons' for other problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. pretty light circle. 
Cons:. It crashed!! back up drives should not crash within the first year! Customer service is not the greatest.. 
Summary:. It lost all my data and memories, my MAC HD outlived my BU drive...sad.. Save your data and memories......Never buy a WD HD again!!. 

$$;
Pros:. nice blue light. 
Cons:. Unreliable, fragile, poor documentation/information. 
Summary:. We bought 2 of these 10 months ago. The first one stopped working in the summer when it fell 4 inches (4 -- not 6, not 10, not 12, but 4), on to a carpeted (read soft and cushioned) floor. It whirrs and clicks, but doesn't show up on the PC. No way to fix it, Best Buy, of course, wouldn't touch it without a service agreement, etc. Data lost.. The second one worked throughout the summer, then sat for 2 months, undisturbed, untouched, safe, and secure. Now it is generating the following message: "the disk you inserted is not readable by this computer". Hmmm. And why is that? It's the same computer and the same drive and the same port and the same cables. It's even the same outlet in the wall. Data inaccessible...LOST!!!!. Before the summer, when first using the drive, the inadequate instructions led to a frustrating and costly (time and data) sequence of events. My Book is formatted FAT32, which works with both MAC and PC... but only for some things. There are no instructions saying it needs to be reformatted for optimal use with a MAC. Problems arose when trying to transfer video via iDVD. To solve the problem, the all previously stored data had to be backed up on another external drive, then the my Book was reformatted. But transferring the data back was also problematic (it took a technician several days to get what she could back) and some of it was lost. Simple instructions would have circumvented this issue.. If you are one of the lucky ones who have no problems with this drive, then great! Otherwise, don't take a chance with your data -- We have lost so much that we valued both personally and professionally. Find something with a better track record, even if it is more expensive.. Updated. on Oct 19, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. There are none, it's a brick!. 
Cons:. It is not recognized by Vista. Most Western Digital external drives aren't.. 
Summary:. What else need to be said? Just one more product that Vista can't load drivers for. Funny thing is, my Mac recognizes it with no problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. It works but not without problems. 
Cons:. Noisy and lights do not show capacity as promised. 
Summary:. Support is impossible. Downloads don't work and you cannot contact them by email or by phone. If you buy it toss it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large capacity. 
Cons:. Not reliable. Failed within 2 months of having it.. 
Summary:. I was excited when I bought this drive. I was upgrading from a 6 year old Que 60gb drive, because my computer no longer had a firewire port, and I needed more space. The My Book drive wasn't too expensive, and I could back up my data, and expand my storage space. However, within 2 months of having this drive, it completely failed on me. It still powers up. The computer still recognizes that something is being plugged in. However, the drive does not mount. It just does nothing. I cannot access it. When I look at it with Disk Management, it shows an unknown not initialized drive.. Errors occur if I try to initialize it or format it. And, other hdd tools don't even recognize that it is plugged into my system. It was never dropped. Nothing ever happened to it. It just simply quit working. So to make a long story short, my advice is to avoid this item at all costs. Do not purchase. Go for something more reliable.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are no "pros" to any Western Digital device I've seen yet.. 
Cons:. Won't install, won't stay connected, won't back-up on schedule. 
Summary:. I have now been burned twice by Western Digital's (WD) crap drives. I can't believe I was stupid enough to buy a second one (Essential, 500 GB), after the 1 TB My Book World Edition had to be replaced twice (WD sent me a defective drive on the first replacement attempt). I don't know who is designing/manufacturing/testing these door-stops, but that's about all they're good for. Please don't make the mistake I did and buy a WD product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not working - no Pros. 
Cons:. Cannot be installed under Vista (even with SP1). 
Summary:. Half an year ago I bought an external MyBook ssential 320GB (first edition). It worked and still works fine, and as I need more extrenal capacity for backups and photos, I decided to buy MyBook Essential 500 GB (this time Second Edition). And it was a bad mistake. After plug-in I got message: Installing new device driver, after that "No driver found". So I chose to search on Internet, no driver found again, tried to search on System disk... I got message "Driver found but could not be installed...". This made me angry. Again I tried old 320 GB, still working. So I tried to seatch on Western Digital web - and I found an article about this problem, in which author tried to persuade me to delete file infosys.1. Fortunately I did not because I found later on MS web info that deleted file won�t be created again:---))) MS offers some hotfix KB 940199, so I downloaded it, but what a surprise... Your system does not require this hotfix, or something like this. So, I really do not know what to do... First - not to buy anything from Western Digital anymore, second uninstall Vista (downgrade to old good XP...). Does somebody have another solution? By te way, why old drive is working and new one needs some extra drivers? The longer I use Vista tho longer I feel, that this product is not finished - even after SP1 installation. Already olved problems in XP are now appearing again.... Howgh... Now I am waiting if MS support and also WD support gives me some useful info... If I got this drive work I will write again... By until then, Jan. 

$$;
Pros:. Up and running in minutes. 
Cons:. Harddrive crashed. 
Summary:. The harddrive crashed after 1 year of service, anyone know how much data recovery costs?. 

$$;
Pros:. you don't know your in a burning plane at 300mph till your dead!!!. 
Cons:. You don't know your in a burning plane at 300mph.... 
Summary:. OK so--I bought this lovely sleek looking product caught at a great price.. plugged it in and away I went.. I had GBs and GBs of data on all kinds of media and thi slook like the perfect solution.. if was effortless to send files bakc and forth.. download went righ tot the drive.. it was quiet... I was like a crackhead with a hidden stash the size of fort knox... 265 GB later---YES FANS !! 265 Gigabytes later.. I go to plug the turn it on and ----- VOILA!!. USB can't identify the device error!!!. no problem --I have a 2nd computer --oh see USB found the device and installed.. EXCEPT I can't see the drive.. (hmm did I mention I had 265GB of MF data on this damn thing) my entire MP3 collection and family photos, movies etc etc etc.... So now I'm stuck with the thing that does not but make clicking sounds which I found out later meant the heads were screwed... WD yea I mean Western Digital must be a scam company form a third world country because I can't find them anywhere or any help for this product which I KNOW they must've have realized this would happen... hard drive recovery of my data was going to cost me a whopping $1700 to send the driv eto a clean room lab that would take this thing apart and recover the data from the disk therein.... So yes all I could is throw it in the garbage and find something better... and rebuild... If I didn't say it already -- **** WESTERN DIGITAL!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. big, so you can't take it with you all the time. mean; no responsibility. 
Cons:. not safe, hard to open case, enough slow. 
Summary:. 1. main directory is not clean, full of some programs and klasors. some of this programs are just trials.. 2. slow. i couldn't finish my backup for hours. 3. and in 2-3 weeks fat damaged and i lost all these backup hours and days of data.. 4. fat formatted. so my datas gone. while recording power got down and no any my book around. why ntfs is not default. this is backup tool. i saw it after transferred much data unfortunately and i didn't change.. 5. now i'm trying recover my datas. sure from usb it is not possible and i have to open the case. i must connect the hard disk to the machine directly. but;. - guaranty will go down. - still i couldn't open. wd designers worked so hard about to make opening this case really difficult. they had to work hard to make the product safe for data.. i will open it by anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works great when it works. 
Cons:. High failure rate. 
Summary:. Thought I was getting a premiere drive from a premiere company to keep my backups on but I was mistaken. The first drive lasted 6 months before I had to replace it under the warranty. The replacement drive lasted 8 months and of course the warranty has expired. I won't be replacing it with anything from Western Digital especially considering drives from other manufacturers have lasted me for years without a hiccup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does Not Work. 
Cons:. Does Not Work. 
Summary:. Western Digital products and company are horrible i have been back and forth on the phone with India(Wester Digital Support) for the past month and a half. I purchased an elements drive which did not work they instead shipped me out a refurbished my book which did not work then they sent me another refurbished My Book which is not working. I am left with two refurbished drives that dont work and they have my original purchased drive. They tried to convince me that i need to call my motherboard manufacturer mean while i have two passports that worked and installed properly on my Gateway laptop. Be aware stay away i am definetly one of the unlucky ones 3 drives in a row that dont work thats not unlucky thats bad business and bad manufacturing. If this issue does not get resolved I am reporting them to the Better Business Bureau this is ridiculous. Just understand what you are getting yourself into and this goes for most drives that they manufacture not just this my book.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a nice blue light.. 
Cons:. It doesn't work. At all. My lava lamp makes a better hard drive.. 
Summary:. I am sitting looking at the sticker that says 'Works with Windows Vista' on the box. This product does not work with Vista, and if I could be bothered, I'd sue Western Digital for a complete wasted day of stuffing around. There is not even a CD that comes in the box, the website is completely unhelpful, and there seem to be no resources whatsoever to get this thing going. The annoying thing is that I managed to see the drive for about two hours, and copied all my personal data onto it. Now it's disappeared, and I can't even reformat it to take it back to the shop. No amount of system tools will even recognise that the thing exists. A complete and absolute waste of money.. 

$$;
Pros:. When the device doesn't work, there are NO "Pros".... 
Cons:. "UNKNOWN DEVICE" by Windows Vista Home Premium on 1-month old Acer Aspire notebook. NO Installation CD-ROM w/drivers included in box. NO downloadable Vista OR XP drivers at wdc.com.. 
Summary:. BUYER BEWARE...I did the research and finally decided to buy a 500GB external drive...Only I bought the WRONG ONE. There are GLOWING reviews at buy.com, dell.com, etc with NO NEG reviews posted. Just Google ["my book essential" "vista"] and you'll find NUMEROUS postings about this drive not being recognized by Windows, or becoming unrecognizable AFTER you've loaded valuable data on it. DON'T BE FOOLED by the low price! If you get this drive and it is unrecognized by Windows -- There's nothing you can do to "make" it be recognized...NO DRIVERS ANYWHERE for Vista or XP. Just the fact that wdc.com DOES NOT HAVE XP or Vista drivers for download at their own website should tell you that THEY don't even know how to get it to work with anything more than Win98SE!! Furthermore...CNET didn't even plug in and TEST this "Essential Edition" before posting their "review" here...Read it yourself.. This is supposed to be VISTA-COMPATIBLE, meaning I plug it in and start using it as others have reported in their glowing reviews. Instead, I've wasted 2 hours of my Saturday morning with a stupid ext hard drive that is NOT recognized by my (up-to-date) Vista Home Premium...There's no friggin' driver at Western Digital's website for downloading and installing. There's no CD-ROM containing drivers included. So I'm sitting here looking at the quietest hard drive I've ever owned. In fact, it's about to boxed back up and returned to DELL because I'm tired of dealing with it. Fortunately, for the 2 people still using Win98 SE, there's a downloadable driver at www.wdc.com...What a complete JOKE!. You've been WARNED.... 

$$;
Pros:. It worked for about 2 months. 
Cons:. It's Garbage. 
Summary:. Do not buy this drive. The drive worked for about 2 months then one day my computer suddenly could not locate the drivers. On restart, the drive could not be recognized. I've tried all necessary troubleshooting but the drive no longer spins, does not get warm and cannot be recognized. My best friend had an identical experience with the My Book 250GB drive. Western Digital tech support is completely useless and will not make recommendations in data recovery. Don't waste your money or your time with Western Digital drives.. 

$$;
Pros:. none, the reason I bought this drive was the cost. 
Cons:. Just doesnt work and no tech support. 
Summary:. Worked find for a couple of days then then bamm! computer can't recognize the hard drive. I tried calling there tech support what a joke can't reach a live person with a pulse to talk with, the message says someone will assist you in 15 min waited for an hour and still no answer. I tried to email tech support but still no response. I will never buy another WD product. Save your money.... 

$$;
Pros:. The Light worked. 
Cons:. Would not turn off or install correctly. 
Summary:. After 3 failed installation attempts finally returned. Virtually no documentation with drive, no support on website and no easy way to find drivers or software. Installation crashed my system. Poor product, poor support.. 

$$;
Pros:. price, fancy looking. 
Cons:. feels like the casing costed .50 cents to make! Doesnt work!!!. 
Summary:. I bought this and was real excited to get it. 500 drive so cheap. well you get what you pay for is true here! I unwrap it, plug it in and it worked for like 20 mins, and then it just dissapeared off my computer!? I unplugged the usb and plugged it back in, and nothing! There is only one way to turn it off, the round button on the front. I hold it down for a year and try everything but it wont turn off. So i unplug it and plug it back in and finally the computer sees it. A few mins later again it dissapears!!!? So again i unplug and replug but this time it wont even turn on????!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY and your hair! Dont buy this piece of junk!.
