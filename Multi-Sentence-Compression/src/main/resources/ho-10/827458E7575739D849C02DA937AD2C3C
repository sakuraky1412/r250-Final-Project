i was a bit surprised to find a trouser press , iron and ironing board in the room – i felt a bit like i was in a laundry !
the dinner was good too , and the staff were very helpful in preparing sandwiches for members of the party who arrived later in the evening .
there were good information packs in the rooms and plenty of local tourist information was available in the lobby area too .
i saw another travelers negative comment about the cats , but am happy to note there was no sign of them in the dining area when we were eating .
the rooms had plenty of storage , they also had a bath and a shower in the ( avocado ) en-suite with plenty of hot water .
the location is good , it’s a very short walk around the corner to the beach , harbour area and nearest shop .
it is situated on the edge of west bay and was very quite at night .
the downside was that they were all a bit tired and chintzy .
the only improvement i can think of is if they were to offer some vegetarian sausages if someone wanted a vegetarian full english breakfast . . .
the one i had was very soft and drooped in the middle .
