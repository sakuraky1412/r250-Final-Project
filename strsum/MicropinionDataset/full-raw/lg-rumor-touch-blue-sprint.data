i have read through every one of the reviews here and have not had any of the problems listed in any of the negative ones  .
this phone is easy to use and works very well  .
the camera is sharp (much better than my blackberry)  .
it is a great phone for the money .
i think you should get this phone for the price it is .
bottom line    amazing phone , only had it for one day and dont plan on selling it anytime soon  .
great texting , web , everything )except the keyboard)  .
go out and buy this phone  .
if you want a phone a little on the cheaper side but has awesome features i would say this is definatly the phone to go with  .
i'm very happy with this phone , cannot find anything i do not like about it .
this phone is a perfect phone  .
i've been very happy since purchasing the phone in early june  .
i especially like the firmware update making it easier to unlock the phone as that would have been one thing in the con list before .
great phone very versatile but has the average camera .
i just got this phone today and i like it pretty much and i have a pretty good feelings about the 2 years that i have to use this phone  .
before i have a chocolate phone in verizon , but i switched to sprint because people around me kept saying that sprint's better and i wanted to pay less for my very first touch screen phone  .
when i started playing around , i tried to find the ringtones , but it is very confusing it is way different from verizon phone'ss interfaces and setup  .
this phone does not even let be put a big clock or something on the main screen  .
so the main screen is blank with just your screensaver  .
although it's sort of boringish , it had all what i needed which is why i'm satisfied still .
for the money there is not a phone that touches this iphone quality interface , i is a skeptic but this thing really does rock .
great texting feature phone for sprint and virgin mobile  .
although not as feature    rich as the lg env touch , the phone contains things that the lg env touch does not .
if you like a touch screen , you will like this one .
i do like this phone  .
i got it for my birthday and i thought it is a very cool , unique phone  .
the screen resolution is pretty good the facebook app is not very good  .
if you go to the internet browser and go to facebook , it is better then the actual app that is able to be downloaded , but not the best thing ever  .
the app of facebook is very hard to see the words (small) and i don't think you are able to zoom it on it myspace is limited , so you are able to go on it , but not view everything texting is actually good  .
i like how you don't have to delete texts , it actually looks like an im when you go through it , and then after about 50 texts it starts to delete from the bottom on its own  .
the only thing with the texting is that for some reason , i don't know if this is only me , and it rarely happens , but a message comes up saying texts cannot be sent , so i have to restart the phone email and im is actually pretty well  .
i can get pretty well out of that  .
i get my windows live messenger , aim , yahoo messenger , aol mail , yahoo mail , hotmail mail  .
the only thing i see that i don't have is skype , which is a disappointment because that is probably one of the main im's that i use internet is blah  .
its not the slowest , but not the fastest  .
youtube rarely worked , but as the days came along , for some reason it seemed that more and more videos started to work speaker is good  .
you can make it louder or lower as your on the call , and you can also text as your on a call  .
its actually a pretty cool thing that you can do the battery life is very short  .
i really hate that it has small battery life , but i guess thats what we need the charger for  .
oh well with that its not the perfect phone , and you can tell it is defiantly not a smartphone , but it is still pretty good  .
do not buy the phone if you expect to be on the internet a lot , cause that will not work out for you  .
but if your a 12    16 year old that uses phones for texting , im , and call , then this would probably be one of the best phones you can get i love it , and it might have a few glitches , but those glitches i barley use (exept for the facebook)  .
verizon has its envs and sprint has its rumors  .
lg and verizon obviously have a decent partnership , because the rumor touch is not the env touch  .
however , the env touch is an editor's choice , so it's pretty hard to be as great  .
that being said , the rumor touch is pretty decent in its own right user interface (touchscreen)    .
the touchscreen is not bad for a resistive one , but it is still resistive  .
scrolling through menus often results in the accidental selecting of an icon , and keep your fingernails long  .
all in all , though , it is responsive enough for all but those who have been using capacitive screens since 2007  .
and let's face it , if you have been using capacitive screens since '07 , you're probably not going to buy this phone anyway overall , the ui is simple enough to understand and navigate , and the menus are easily customizable in an intuitive and simple way  .
the hello ui is cool , but it's really hard to get to , and so i , for one , never use it , which is a real shame because it is a great concept , just poorly executed  .
still , brew (qualcomm's os , used on the phone) is simple and straightforward and will appeal to the heavy texter , and even the average one features  .
the rumor touch has a great feature set for the most part , with dedicated google maps , email , twitter , and facebook apps  .
it also has both a default browser and the excellent opera mini , which is speedy and easy to use and great over a 3g connection  .
the email app is far from spectacular , and only works with yahoo  .
and gmail (so i couldn't hook up my verizon account) , but hey , it's there , and most people i know use yahoo  .
and gmail anyway  .
still , it's really not a blackberry  .
the twitter and facebook apps are similar to the email in that they are far for great , but they're there and that's a bonus any day on a feature phone (p  .
i don't use facebook and twitter , so i really haven't used them except to see what they were       you should get a second opinion on them  .
google maps is an awesome app that works as a gps ; it's kind of slow , but it will help if you are completely lost and need help , which is really what it's supposed to do there are plenty of web applications you can download through opera mini , but there is very little freeware  .
there are a few decent ones for free , but prepare to pay if you want anything truly productive  .
the games on the phone are bad ; tetris is the only one that comes with the phone and is free ; prepare to pay 5 bucks for everything , literally everything , else media  .
there is a microsd slot on the phone that can support up to 32gb microsd cards , so if you use it , you can put all the music on it you want , provided you buy the card  .
the multimedia is not bad  .
sound quality is good , and videos are pretty much what you would expect from a 240x400 screen       kind of watchable the camera is not terrible , but not terribly good either  .
it takes 2  .
0 megapixel still , and auto    adjust but lacks any decent zoom feature  .
in short , it's a standard featurephone camera  .
never use the camcorder  .
never  .
please  .
it records at qvga resolution (320x240) and is really bad  .
that said , so is pretty much every non    smartphone camcorder on the market none of the browsers on the phone have any sort of flash player , but they will play youtube videos  .
if you choose standard quality , the phone usually has no problems playing the video  .
you can also choose high quality on youtube , but the phone often stutters and the quality is not much better       meaning bad other things of importance  .
the phone , despite being pretty much all plastic , feels pretty sturdy sprint's network is , in my opinion , bad  .
really bad  .
if you use and like sprint , hey , have fun , maybe it's great for you , maybe pittsburgh , pa is just a bad area for them  .
i do not like it , but it's not bad enough to be a deal    breaker for me call quality on the phone is good , not amazing , but not bad either  .
it will be just fine for just about everybody wrap    up  .
there is really nothing about this phone that really blew me away , but there is nothing that made me cringe either  .
the good things about this phone definitely outweigh the bad , and the few bad things are really mostly minor and hardly deal    breakers for everyone except heavy smartphone users , this phone will be great updated  .
on sep 11 , 2010  .
if the sprint version is exactly like the virginmobile , than you'll love this phone  .
however , do not get locked into a 2    year contract with sprint , even if the phone is offered cheaper than $130 or for free .
bottom line is the lg rumor touch is a great phone for those not ready to spend the top $$$ for the 4g experience  .
top of the line for 3g multi    media phones  .
its a nice phone , i have it in purple  .
got it 2 days ago  .
looks good , performs pretty decent , little problems (apps/internet)  .
i have had this phone for 4 months now  .
at the price that you can get it at , it is not bad for starters , but i get annoyed with the lack of no end call button  .
the unlock feature is , i believe to easy , and if it is in your pocket , you will almost always find it unlocked and sometimes dial or even text people it works nice with the 3g coverage , youtube is sketchy sometimes so if you are going to buy this phone , i suggest buying some sort of leather carrying case also , not sure if it is just mine , or just an over all problem with the model , i will occasionally find my phone completely shut off , and sometimes it will lock up and freeze , and not even the power button will work , i have to take the battery out the camera is decent for only a 2  .
0mp and the video quality is much better then i expected , the music player is nice , but you can not use it while doing anything else so over all , i'm okay with the purchase of this phone , but i am thinking of a new one after only such a short time .
besides all the hassel with activating the phone , it is very worth it  .
i love this phone  .
love the 3in display and touch screen  .
i like the camera options but you can only zoom in camcorder but not camera hmmm  .
get the opera mini browser asap , it works great and give you true html experience minus flash  .
a decent pdf viewer and few other tools  .
a good music player and ability to download music on the fly  .
now the sprint tv is my biggest complaint  .
even with all my ev    do bars i rarely can get anything at all  .
now to the media player , it plays mp4 but it is a bit choppy just enough to annoy you  .
hate to get off track but the opera mini will jam up if you play youtube on it  .
the stock browser works the best youtube and that's it  .
all in all i bought it to replace my palm centro which had such a lil screen and buttons though it is a great media player without a doubt  .
the lg rumor touch is a good buy for a 3in screen msg phone with great features updated  .
on sep 8 , 2010  .
as you can see , this phone has a long list of limitations  .
if you can get over them , this phone is fine  .
but after using it for a couple months , i'm already looking for a new phone .
also another con    .
maybe i haven't read the directions closely enough , but i don't seem to find the touchscreen all that useful  .
cannot drag or scroll anything  .
i basically can select stuff  .
that's it oh , the phone is less than 2 months old  .
i do not see how it's as great as some of the other reviewers do .
i don't like touch screens so this review may not be helpful to you if you do like them  .
i figured i'd try this one since i loved the slide out qwerty keyboard and the phone got such great sound quality reviews  .
i primarily use my phone as a phone so sound quality is a crucial issue for me  .
it is a good phone however , if you are not a touch screen fan or if you do not have nimble fingers , i wouldn't recommend this phone  .
in order to dial a number you have to go through a combination of at least 3 keys/menus    if the phone is locked , you have to unlock it , then hit the dial pad and then dial or use the speed settings  .
this is very problematic if you drive a lot , as i do  .
it's also just annoying  .
talking on the phone should be simple , but it is not with the rumor touch  .
also , if you want to make a call from your call history , you have to use the mini    chicklet sized buttons on the touch screen    i am a mid    30's woman with relatively small fingers  .
despite that , many a time i've mis    hit the screen and gotten the wrong result  .
that said , i like the weight of the phone , the ease of use and the style  .
i never texted before getting the rumor touch and it has been a breeze  .
i think i'd be in love with the phone if it had hard keys for dialing  .
as an aside , a word of warning    if you are not sure about getting a touch screen phone , be careful where you buy    if you buy directly from sprint they will charge you a $35 restocking fee once the phone is activated  .
i didn't realize this (my bad)  .
if i had , i would've bought from radio shack as i usually do  .
the only reason i bought from sprint in the first place is to avoid the $18 activation fee on my upgrade  .
now i have to pay the restock fee , plus , in case you didn't know    once you ask sprint for a return kit , if they don't log the phone back into their system within 30 days , they will charge you a $200 fee    regardless of if they received the phone back  .
so , if you change your mind about returning the phone , not only will you be out the $35 restocking fee which they take up front and will not refund to you , but they will also further charge your credit card $200 for the inconvenience of having sent out a return kit  .
bottom line    do not buy directly from sprint .
i didn't have the phone for more than a few days  .
scrolling on the touchpad is next to impossible  .
this made accessing menus that did not fit on the display screen more time consuming because you had to slide out the qwerty keyboard  .
setting an alarm time or entering a time for a calendar event is very frustrating  .
i'll play with the phone a few more days to see if i get used to it but most likely i will end up returning the phone to sprint updated  .
on jul 10 , 2010  .
phone worked great until about three days ago  .
i went to use my phone one evening when i realized that it seemed to reboot it self but wouldn't complete the process  .
the screen kept flashing the rumor logo with a please wait  .
i could not turn it off or on either  .
took the battery out to see if it would help , but nothing  .
phone is in the shop now and i am being told this a common occurrence with the phone  .
apparently nothing can be done and now i am looking at getting a refurbished phone because i am past the 30 day guarantee  .
nothing like paying full price for a phone , having it work for less than 2 months to only end up with a reject that will probably do the same thing in the future  .
it has an auto    lock that you cannot override , so you have to continuously be unlocking the phone during the call to access the number pad or speaker phone mode the phone is not loud enough to hear the person talking in any kind of noise the auto redial is annoying on every call when you try access the key pad  .
hard to see in sunlight  .
the bubbles wo not let you access other features until you address them  .
key pads a little small  .
this phone looks great and definitely has a lot of reviews that are positive , but it is not that great of a phone  .
the number one problem with this phone is it's problem with dropping calls , not being able to get calls out because of poor signal quality  .
i is within 4 blocks of a sprint tower and it had no signal , while three other people with me , all had full bars the touch screen on this phone works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't  .
you may have to tap it numerous times to get it to respond  .
it is really difficult to scroll down on this phone , because it likes to open up other options that you are not meaning to open up  .
i use scrolling up and down all of the time with my ipod and rarely have a problem with this issue , unlike this phone the power on and off button is located on the right side of the phone and it is easy to turn your phone off , while holding the phone talking with someone , and while putting the phone in the carrying case  .
just pressing lightly on this button will turn it off this phone is more of a phone for someone who texts a lot , but not a good phone for someone that makes a lot of calls  .
i am around computers all of the time , have used cell phones for years and i love troubleshooting problems , yet i found this phone to be overly complicated and frustrating to use  .
the book that comes with it is poorly written and difficult to follow .
i'm coming from a fried moto q9c  .
i guess i is expecting more of a business phone , but the rumor touch did not deliver  .
my wife had the original rumor for a few days but it had similar issues only worse i would not recommend this phone to anyone who wants to use the web or facebook  .
the emailing capabilities are pretty good , but it's not worth the quirks not sure what i'll be trying next , but lg is not an option updated  .
on apr 30 , 2010  .
i just got my lg rumor touch about 6 days ago  .
i had it for 3 days and it worked great  .
i loved it  .
until the 4th day i is on the web like i is for the last 3 days b4 that n all of sudden it froze and restarted itself and it just start on the restart screen for like 2 hours ( the screen when u first turn ur phone on and rumor touch is in the little cartoon bubble and it says please wait ) and it kept blinking rumor touch please wait it did it for 2 hours so i went to radio shack because thats where i got mine and they gave ne a brand new one and i is afraid to get on my web because of what happened with the other one  .
so i just tried it and i is on my homepage of myphone on the web for about 20 seconds and it froze and restarted but i got lucky and it actually didnt stay on the start up screen for hours but i tried to get on the web about 4 other times and it froze everytime and restarted everytime and ive been lucky enough that it didnt stay on start up screen for hours  .
but when i got my new one i asked the person at radio shack if theyve had anyone has had any problems with this phone and she said only one other time and the persons screen is just white  .
so i dont know maybe i got a defective one both times  .
maybe i didnt and everyone does it  .
i asked the person that worked at radio shack if anyone has had any problems with it and they told me that only one other time and the persons screen just went white , but other than that no one else has complained  .
but i like to go on the web on my phone and i cant on this because it freezes  .
if i didnt do that it would be a perfect phone .
the camera on this phone sux , i used my old phone to snap quick shots of my baby girl , the camera on this lags by about 1  .
5 seconds , hidious , should not even be called a camera , more like a toy for a 8 year old , unless subject is a rock , the picture will be 1  .
5 second late and blurry as crap  .
hating this phone .
1   no speed dials  .
2   google maps doesnt have gps work or even 'my location' , touch screen doesnt work either  .
3   lots of 3rd party applications dont work like games  .
4   on a phone call if you click the dial pad and talk for 1 min , the phone auto locks and you need to click 3 buttons to hang up  .
5   cant set your own music as ringtones  .
6   doesnt support  .
wma files  .
7   hard typing keyboard , keep pushing multipe keys  .
8   when you want to take a video it always asks you which option , small video or long video , instead of one preset setting  .
9   you have to press lots of buttons to get small things done and then you have to press 'done' at the end of almost everything  .
10   no quick links on the home screen  .
11   doesnt always send texts , randomly does and doesnt , have to restart  .
12   restarts every so often right in the middle of something  .
13   will not merge 2 way calls so that you can make a conference  .
if you do not need any of these things , it's the best phone in the whole world  .
horrible phone , bad quality everything , do not buy  .
