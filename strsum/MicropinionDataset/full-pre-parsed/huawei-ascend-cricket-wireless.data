first off , i feel that i need to say that jessica dolcourt didn  .

t do a very good job on the review of this phone  .

my call quality is fine  .

the phone is awesome , i can  .

t believe that it  .

s only (150  .

00) i paid 129  .

99 and got free overnight shipping  .

this phone has everything anyone would want in an android smartphone .

i've had this phone for about a week , and i love it  .

my daughter picked up the zio when they were first available , and when i went to buy , i had the intention of getting the same thing  .

the cricket salesman talked me into this phone , and i'm so glad he did  .

granted , i'm not to tech    savvy but , i love the 9 home screens , and have had a blast looking through all the available apps  .

it comes in handy when having to entertain the grandkids too  .

i have to fight to get my phone back ,  .

i have not had any huge battery issues , granted , never having had a smartphone , the first day i is shocked at how much battery drainage actually occurs  .

but downloaded a task killer app and is done with that problem all in all , i'd say this phone is excellent for the cost , and so far i've had no problems with the cricket service either  .

if you buy this phone , you will love it  .

so cricket has officially stunned me with this deal breaker  .

this is by far one of the best phones ive ever owned in its price range , and i believe it could compare to and compete with higher end phones such as mytouch 3g , cliq , cliq xt  .

its my personal belief that android kicks the crap outta that stupid iphone , and is much more user friendly than any blackberry ive seen so far , that being said , cricket is also a great way to go if you are trying to get away from contract phones  .

and to top all of it off cricket has a pretty fast 3g network , and with that , you couldnt go wrong with this phone if it can even be called a phone feels more like an internet tablet/ palm top pc with calling/texting features lol .

u can do just about anything on this phone .

this is a helluva deal  .

cricket's network has been great for me since i started using them three years ago  .

this phone blew me away  .

it compares to phone costing twice as much updated  .

on nov 6 , 2010  .

i have been a fan and customer of cricket for 9 years now  .

i learned of cricket while visiting my brother in columbus , ga 10 years ago  .

i is upset that we did'nt have it in houston at the time  .

i is an at t customer then , and as soon as cricket landed in houston , i dropped at t like a bad habit  .

how could you lose  .

at those prices ( $35  .

00 ) you could get 2 of them and get rid of your land line in the process  .

unfortunately , i relocated to ga in 2009       ( is not happy at all  .

the coverage area in columbus , ga sucked for the cricket market there and i had to go with sprint  .

well i'm back in houston , tx now       ) very happy again  .

one problem though contract with sprint  .

i had the palm pre , and destroyed 4 of them in a year  .

fortunately i only signed up for 1 year with sprint  .

i saw that cricket is getting an android phone , and i wanted it  .

i is willing to break my contract to get it too  .

well , i just happened to be in the store paying my sons bill and saw the zio  .

my god this must be some kind of a joke i said to myself  .

this is crap , i might as well stay with sprint  .

sprint is 2 months away from the samsung epic 4g and my contract is up for renewal oct  .

well i got the epic and just loved it  .

that is until cricket dropped the huawei ascend for smart phone heaven  .

i saw it , touched it played with it and is just all giddy  .

well , i took sprint up on there offer of 30 days , if you do not like it , bring it back  .

i took it back , got the ascend and never looked back  .

yeah , i gave up the epic for the ascend  .

spotty 4g service in houston , and a 10  .

00 premium just to have 4g to me just was'nt worth it  .

the ascends 3g works perfect  .

bravo cricket , well done  .

since then i have rooted this phone and downloaded barnacle , i can take my ipod and all of my wireless devices for a spin around the internet , at no additional fee  .

sprint wanted $39  .

00 for the same service monthly  .

guess who picked up that crappy zio  .

sprint ,   were they smoking that week  .

the huawei ascend and cricket wireless , who could ask for anything more .

this phone is fantastic  .

i paid $129 online for it would be thrilled to have paid twice as much  .

cricket coverage is great where i live the calls sound super  .

the phone is fast , responsive beautifully put together  .

i thought the trackball is going to seem like a throwback to the blackberry vowed never to use it , but it's been handy  .

there is a shortage of cool cases for this phone , but i is able to turn an iphone 3g case upside down it fits like a glove seriously , i could not be happier  .

updated  .

on nov 4 , 2010  .

i love this phone  .

it has a really nice screen , it  .

s really bright , and clear , the touch screens really responsive and i haven't needed to calibrate it yet  .

it has 9 customizable home screens and you have control over all the shortcuts  .

the phone has a sturdy build , the solid buttons have a nice feel to them , and seem as though they will last a long time  .

the trackball is very nice but it seems a little lose at times  .

it has a button just for the camera which is always nice when you need a camera and quick  .

it has a button to lock the screen and if you hold it in you can put the phone on silent mode , airplane mode , power off , and recent applications  .

if the phone is turned off you also use that button to turn it back on  .

the one thing i do not like about the phone itself is the way the mini usb charger and the 2  .

5mm headphone jack is all under the same cover  .

when you open the cover i am always afraid i'm going to pull it out where it is attached  .

the other covers are fine , i just don't like this one because the charger and headphone jack share a cover  .

i heard other people saying that the back cover feels plasticy but it is sturdy plastic that does not seem likely to crack android 2  .

1 is very good and reliable  .

you can run several apps at once without a problem  .

at first i is a little worried about the absence of a physical keyboard , but the phone has swype which is very accurate and easy to use , which makes text input a breeze so far with cricket wireless i have not lost coverage yet  .

i totally disagree with the cnet editor who wrote the review about the call quality being terrible that statement is not at all true  .

i is actually rather impressed with the call quality  .

the data speeds are so fast  .

it downloads a 5 megabyte song in about 35 seconds  .

if you are watching a youtube video you do not even have to wait for it to load  .

it loads faster enough that there is no waiting i am extremely satisfied with this phone and would recommend it to anyone  .

overall just great , even watched the episodes of ncis i missed , no problem , wifi kicks in , had it for a week now and happy as can be with it so far and the price , fantastic , yahoo messenger locked up on me , but i installed a smaller app of it , works just fine ,  .

android everything with a super excellent value phone and plan  .

much more than i expected  .

and i am getting great reception in kansas city  .

my roomies t    mobile phones have issues in my house so i is anticipating issues and is very curious to see what sort of reception this cricket ascend would have    but no problems here there is also a little known advance payment benefit that cricket offers if you pay three months in advance you get one month free  .

not sure why this is not advertised widely , but about a year ago i got a text on my old cricket    flashed palm pre about getting one month free if i paid for three months in advance  .

it's awesome  .

i ask each time i go to pay my bill if the offer is still good and it is  .

so          that means my $55 monthly unlimited talk / text / internet plan goes down to $41  .

25 (plus taxes) per month  .

is not this unbelievable  .

and , btw , who needs insurance  .

i got mine online for $129  .

at $5 a month for insurance ($60 a year) why not just buy a new one if you need to  .

and as far as that goes , a year from now i might want a different phone and since there is no contract i can upgrade myself whenever i want and sell my old phone on craigslist or something updated  .

on oct 29 , 2010  .

i is reluctantly about to pull the trigger on a zio which i tried out in the store even though i did not really like it (too slow and only had android 1  .

i went to the cricket website to order it and they had just put the ascent up for $100  .

00 less  .

i figured it was not going to be that great either but i felt for the price , i would take a chance  .

wow    is i pleasantly surprised  .

i like it as much if not better than anything else i checked out  .

in fact , many people i have shown it to has gone out and picket one up too to save on their monthly bills  .

the ascend rocks  .

a lot of phone for the price cricket is not a bad carrier if you do not have to deal with the third world cust service people , sure , a lot of other phones surpass this one's specs , but not if you factor in price it just does everything reasonably well super for a 'starter' android phone .

it is a cheap phone but does well as such  .

s built of plastic but not as cheap as some seem to make it out to be in my opinion  .

battery life varies on what you do and how often  .

i did a little test with my friend at work  .

in 8 hours we did some texting and on our breaks surfed the web and looked up ringtones (same stuff)  .

my friend has a high end android phone and by the end of the work day we both were about to die  .

some apps will drain the battery worse  .

on the other hand , i spent a whole night doing nothing but texting here and there and nothing more and the battery is still almost completely full at the end of the day  .

just seems to be the nature of the beast no matter what phone you have , but it does seem to do as well as any other phone of its kind give or take  .

there is a slight lag when you have many open apps , but i  .

ve found that by this point i don  .

t realize how many i have going and want to turn them off anyway  .

so this is not a bad thing for me  .

the sound quality is good ; i have heard better and it could be louder a little  .

i have missed a phone call/text in public places (people talking , music in background , etc)  .

but to be fair , my universal phone case does not have a cut out for the speaker and it may help to find a case made for this phone  .

the display is good , sure i have seen sharper , but it  .

s nothing to be disappointed about  .

the screen is a fingerprint magnet though and that is annoying  .

however you can always clean it up  .

the camera is horrible in low light , and just okay with lots of light  .

the focus is fixed and no brightness setting , just color balance  .

if picture taking is a big deal to you , you will be very disappointed  .

also , some apps rely on the camera like the bar code scanner app  .

i is unable to read the bar code as a result of the camera  .

otherwise , all and all it  .

s a great phone and what few bad things you could say about it can be made up for in price which is why i give it 5 stars  .

great phone  .

loving this phone  .

everything from the slick and very sensitive touchscreen to the crisp and very clear display  .

lots of apps to download , easy to use interface .

i have admit , i is pretty unsure of this product , mainly because of the shocking low price and because cricket is the carrier but i am deffinately satisfied with this product  .

im a little dissapointed that i dont get reception at my own house but then again most cariers other than verizon dont  .

the only aspect that could have been improved is the battery life , otherwise , this phone is a good choice  .

i would deffinately reccomend it .

the ascend is a very good pre    paid android with up    to    date software (compared to the other pre    paid androids) its a good phone for christmas fast downloads and web speed and differently a better price tag on it then its predecessor sanyo zio priced at 250 and with older version android os (1  .

6) the ascend has android os 2  .

1 and is priced at 150 (208  .

84 when first start with buying the phone and the 55 android plan with taxes) still way cheaper to have something latest thats a pretty good smart phone  .

the screen is alil rough but not bad the sometimes not that noticeable lag i have had so far is not that bad  .

the cam is not a 5mp but its ok for a 3  .

1 could be way better but i took pictures in my low light apartment so dont take the bad cam to far  .

above all compared to the other android phones ( sanyo zio , motorola i1) its top dog on price and speed and software , as of right now i say go for this phone .

like cricket's very reasonable plan prices , the huawei ascend represents getting the best of android technology without having to pay premium prices  .

the phone is sleek and does not look cheap as a professional reviewer warned , and it is very user friendly  .

i am a staunch fan of android tecnology , and this phone is an excellent representation of that technology  .

i recommend the ascend to any cricket customer who is ready to experience or return to the wonders of android technology  .

the gps is accurate , and the sound quality for such apps as pandora is more than adequate  .

i'm very pleased with this purchase  .

face it  .

cricket has a horrible choice of phones and they always seem to be a few steps behind the bigger name companies  .

this is fantastic  .

$55/mo for 100 , 000 free apps , web service , email , etc  .

touch screen which takes some getting used but but otherwise awesome  .

no more flex bucks just to get a freakin' ringtone  .

love it  .

i've had this phone for a few weeks now  .

i'm enjoying every moment  .

i cannot pry myself from the phone  .

best purchase i've ever made  .

for cricket to come out with an android , let alone a cheap , affordable , and one that compares and does quite well compared to other phones on the market , it's stupid to see why anyone would not want to get this phone  .

no contract , $55 a month , only $150 to purchase  .

that's a steal  .

my only problem that is really bothering me is when will the update be for 2  .

2 on this bad boy  .

once it gets the upgrade , which i don't see why it would not , it will definitely be the phone to buy  .

flash would have been nice to for the camera all in all , great phone , great price , the service is not bad with cricket (no matter how many times people say it is) , and it's an android  .

what more could you want  .

to be honest i picked this up as a second phone to experiment with android while i wait for my att 2yr contract on my blackberry bold to expire  .

i first saw the android 1  .

6 zio on i is considering the att samsung captivate , but i am also coveting my friends droidx on verizon  .

the cricket offer came along and for the web special of $129 , overnight shipping and no contract , it is an easy decision to make  .

worst case i port my at t number to it and save $40 a month over my current att plan and just wait for a better droid on att or verizon i have been using a google voice number for past few months and also have forwarded calls from my bb to the ascend , though i still check the bb periodically for any text's i downloaded various apps to the ascend and so far so good  .

android os still has way to go to catch up to blackberry  .

the areas it needs improvement for me  .

1) contact manager   display the contacts company name below their name  .

allow display of name with numbers below the name for contacts with multiple contact numbers 2) provide a good notes app with security  .

i love sync'ing my outlook notes to my bb  .

note   my bb is password protected 3) a good app to sync outlook with blackberry i am trying out dejaoffice , and it has a nice contact manager , notes and a synch utility which i have to test overall , the huawei ascend is a great value for anyone who wants to try an andriod phone with out the risk of a contract  .

it would be nice if phone had more memory and faster cpu  .

hopefully android 2  .

2 will be an available upgrade  .

if not the jump to another carriers better android device will only hurt my wallet , but as far as usability goes most all i learn by working with the ascend wont be wasted crickets coverage where i live (fresno) is good  .

their pricing is great so that may be enough to keep me , especially now that they have a nationwide roaming agreement with sprint .

overall the huawei ascend is a great phone and the price makes it even better  .

i would have preferred a 3  .

5 mm jack on the phone so maybe the next one they come out with will have that but overall , two thumbs up to huawai for making a great phone and having it run on android 2  .

1 is even better updated  .

on nov 10 , 2010  .

why everyone doesn't purchase this phone outright and use it on cricket's reliable 3g network for a $55/month unlimited , no contract plan is a mystery to me i demo'ed the voice gesture search to my uncle today (who travels constantly with his iphone 3g s) and he is very impressed  .

i is getting 3 bars of service in b  .

and using the gps google sky app and he is getting nothing at all and at the same time , he is very impressed with the speed and the nexus theme  .

i even linked it to his infinity m35 through bluetooth and played pearl jam on the way home i didn't have my expectations too high when ordering this phone  .

i previously dated an iphone but hated being a contract slave and paying more than i felt is responsible every month , while also envying the android platform  .

i thought this is a phone (and a plan) i wouldn't have to make a commitment to       and that after a month or two , i would settle into a long term relationship with a better android product i do not know if i'm still wearing beer goggles       or i just woke up beside a 10  .

either way , we're both having fun and seem to get along quite nicely  .

maybe she's the one  .

if you're doing your research before investing in this hand candy , take the plunge  .

the water's fine  .

this cheap date is one you can have a ton of fun with and then proudly show off to momma .

the main reason i bought this phone is to because most of my online organization is run through google (gmail , google calendar , google maps , etc  .

after 3 days of use (so far) , i haven't found much that has made me regret buying it prior to buying this phone i heard some negative input about the overall construction of the phone  .

the body of the phone itself feels pretty solid  .

the back plastic casing picks up finger prints like you wouldn't believe and feels slick to the touch after holding in your hand for a while but the overall rigidity is fairly strong  .

the only thing that concerns me about the construction of the phone , at this point , is the unorthodox pressable buttons that surround the roller ball (below the touch    screen)  .

these buttons are a single , flat , plastic panel that resembles brushed aluminum  .

it is flexible enough to receive the input you are attempting , but this flexibility makes it feel like you could pull it off of the phone without much effort  .

there is also a gap between this panel and the touch    screen that is liable to collect some dust    bunnies and crumbs over time  .

the volume rocker , camera button and power switch are all located on the side of the phone and seem pretty functional  .

i like that the micro    usb port is covered but it's location at the top of the phone , along with the fact that it is concealed within the same port cover as the headset    jack , seems a little cumbersome the performance of the phone is surprisingly good , given the phone's price    point  .

as you probably know , it runs on android 2  .

as i mentioned before , the only lag i have gotten from the processor is while accessing the menus required to install a new shortcut to the home screen  .

other than that , even with 8    10 apps running , i have not incurred much lag the battery life of the phone is also relatively extensive  .

the fact that i have limited phone usage probably doesn't make me the best judge of battery life , but i have made it through the day with 50% battery life remaining after 10 hours interactiion with the phone is very intuitive  .

the screen and keyboard are extremely responsive and accurate  .

the keyboard rotates from profile to landscape view within a single second of rotating the phone itself (compared to an i    phone and it even seemed to rotate faster)  .

when viewing web pages it seems to take a little longer to organize all of the items on screen after rotating  .

the phone also vibrates slightly when you are typing , which is a nice little feature the camera seems decent  .

the quality of picture is good (in adequate lighting)  .

the lens is concealed in a housing that will probably attract debris usually the phone function of a device like this is the first thing that would be mentioned in a review like this  .

for some reason i am getting to it last (sign of the times)  .

the sound quality of a call is slightly tinny but this does not seem to affect clarity  .

the call functions are simple until you reach the time where you have to end a call  .

the only function i have found to hang up is to select the menu button on the press button panel and wait for it to load the end call function  .

this has left my voicemails with 4    5 seconds of empty space at the end , but it's not a big deal and i'm sure there might be a more intuitive function to end calls that i am just not aware of  .

overall , it hasn't been a big enough issue to even be considered an annoyance finally , one word about cricket and their infamous customer service  .

i know that their (outsourced) service personnel is a controversial topic  .

i , however , haven't had a single issue with them to date  .

they were extremely helpful in getting my phone number ported over and explained to me every step necessary to reset the device after my number is successfully ported  .

this is not to say that i wo not run into customer service issues down the road , but so far , they have been nothing but helpful in summary , for a price of $150 retail , this phone actually goes beyond what i expected  .

only several minor hitches prevent it from getting a full five    stars .

this is a great android phone for those who don't want to spend a lot of money on a phone and monthly plan  .

cricket's customer service does suck , had trouble activating the new phone , but cheapest monthly plans make up for that not sure about production quality on this phone but to me it feels tough and sturdy  .

never even heard of huawei products before this came out but so far i don't have any complaints the only concern for me is the battery  .

i have to admit this is my first smartphone so i have been using it very often , browsing , apps , map , etc  .

couple of hours of extended use drains the battery down two a quarter of its charge  .

wish i could compare it to another smartphone but i do not have that experience 4  .

5 stars  .

i is kinda skepic about this phone but so far i have been very impressed with it  .

i hope that my feeling coniue this way .

spent 195  .

00 to get my android service verizon would have cost me close to 700  .

00 after the deposit , android phone , etc  .

i also have cricket broadband works great  .

they just need to boost or expand there coverage then this company would be hard to match .

compared to the zio , the huawei is a slam dunk  .

for someone looking for their first smart phone i see the ascend as a great way to jump in  .

if you are anything like me you do not bother with the manual and just jump in and have fun , but if you are a manual reader you will be seriously disappointed  .

the manual that comes with the phone is about as useful and as taking a blind dog duck hunting , but at least there is a slightly better version online  .

after going through all the online documentation i could find for this device there are still many areas that are not covered , one as case in point , when waking up your phone it says this phone belongs to   and a blank spot then the battery status  .

how in the heck do you put your name in if you wanted to  .

simple things like this should be documented and i hope they are in future revisions  .

but enough of the negative , even without downloading any new apps from the internet (of witch there are thousands and more coming out every day) there are enough bells and whistles to keep you busy and able to do just about anything you would be interested in  .

there is an audio player , web browser , alarm clock with 3 alarm settings , calculator , email and gmail , calendar (where you can set even more alarms) , a note pad , and navigation app  .

while none of these or the many other preinstalled apps are great they are good enough to get the job done  .

the screen has a good enough resolution to watch youtube videos with out being disappointed , and read web pages with ease  .

9 home screens that can be accessed with a simple swipe or by a touch of the on screen minimize key to see all of them  .

the hard keys include call , menu , back and end with a track ball like button in the center that while it does work takes a bit of time to get used to  .

all in all a great deal for the price , and with no contract it is a win win  .

better touch screen sensitivity would be nice and complete documentation lacking are why i only give this phone 3  .

5 stars .

this is my first android phone so not sure what to expect out of them  .

i have cricket and i love the cheap plan that comes with it  .

so far i really really like it and cant quit playing with it  .

but i do wish the battery lasted longer and i knew how to get the wallpaper thing figured out  .

i know i have alot of negatives on here but reguardless i still love the phone  .

i am going to take it back tomorrow to see if perhaps it is just this one phone's problem and not a problem with this model  .

used with the ear buds' , it sounds fine , but handheld the sound quality is horrible no matter what the volume is set to  .

i may follow up with this tomorrow on this forum .

if your used to the iphone , this is for sure a downgrade  .

upright keyboard is very inaccurate , apps are slow  .

i have needed to get this phone twice and i still have issues like a bad battery charging and bad wi    fi antenna  .

this phone would have been better if it is carried though boost or some other carrier with no contracts  .

also , cricket slows down the data transfer after 2gigs  .

i have not dealt with that yet , i will update you on this fact  .

this phone has laptop battery life in 1999  .

the batt  .

drains fast but with some tweaks , you can make it last slightly longer  .

the widget mode on this phone is pretty cool , however i dont understand the need to have a default analog clock on the phone , those only belong on watches  .

the droid has almost the same apps as the iphone but they work considerably different , some for the better , some for the worse  .

overall , you get what you paid for , however , this is the only the 3rd day with this phone and also my 2nd phone  .

when your dealing with cricket , expect disappointment on all fronts  .

the only reason i stick with these guys is cuz the prices are low , just like the customer service  .

dont get it for the camera , it is the worst camera i have ever had , on any device  .

no focus , poor picture , poor video  .

sound speaker is very good , nice and loud and crisp  .

you cant personalize ring tones on this phone , a big lame to that  .

the voice dialer lame as well  .

however the google voice option is great  .

the youtube feature does show vids in hd , which is awesome  .

this phone is fun but if you want something serious , go iphone , those overpriced fools at apple do make a fine product  .

, to bad they are on the att net  .

, also overpriced .

no point in having a phone if it constantly has to be on a charger  .

do not waste your money or energy having to deal with cricket's customer service , which is the worst ever .
