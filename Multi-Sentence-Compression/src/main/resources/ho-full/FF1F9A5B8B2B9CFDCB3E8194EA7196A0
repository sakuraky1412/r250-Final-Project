the easy bit- this hotel is fantastic to look at its part of a huge multi hotel resort in a beautuful spot near a stunning beach .
quaint and personal it isnt but the build quality is suberb and the rooms are truly lovely .
we were upgraded to a suite and had two showers/toilets and everything is really minimalist and trendy .
food was really good and there is a fantastic gym at another hotel on the resort you can pay to use .
tennis courts too but not much else and the entertainmnet was dire .
staff were in the main excellent- apart from a rather pompous customer relations manager we spoke with who was the opposite of customer friendly .
thats the good bit- the bad bit is what ruined our holiday and left us stressed to the point we were considering leaving .
when i booked this holiday it clearly stated that cildren were not allowed at the hotel - that has now changed and the place is swarming with kids - quite honestly the portugese seem to have at least three small children each and another on the way .
the kids were typical kids- zero sense and pushing into the food queues running all over and being general pains ruined the holiday .
its really difficult to describe as every hotel we have ever stayed at has a mix of ages nationalities etc but this place must have been made up of 95 % . . .

its really difficult to describe as every hotel we have ever stayed at has a mix of ages nationalities etc but this place must have been made up of 95 % locals with children- were they getting a special offer ?
who knows but with nothing for kids to really do it made pool time an meal times unbearable .
we complained and even the manager i spoke with agreed it was terrible- we were given a free meal in the lovely top floor a la carte restaurant but unless they change the mix of clientele this hotel will not see us return despite its many positives.
