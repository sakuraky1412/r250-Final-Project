this hotel is located in the heart of the theater district - if the london theater and covent garden is your destination look no further - this is the place for you .
do n't be put off by the small , ill lit lobby - a slight walk to the right takes you to the large , airy and bright restaurant where a sumptuous buffet breakfast is served .
make sure to get a rate that includes breakfast - you have to ask for it .
rooms are on the smaller side but decent for european standards - room with king bed had walking room for one around the bed and a nice desk and sitting area to the side .
bathrooms were functional - rainshower in the bathrooms is a nice touch though water pressure is not sufficient for it .
the manager and concierge provide great service - but you have to ask for it .
i asked to extend my stay for 2 days and was told that i have to check out and move to a different room and pay more .
however when i checked out and came down and explained my situation to the manager she said i can go back to the same room i had and pay the same rate as i had paid the past 2 days .
same experience on the wifii connection - at first i was told that it would cost be gbp 15 / day ( a hefty . . .

similarly i had to ask the concierge for theater tix - his original response was that the popular shows must be sold out - so we should try for less popular ones .
however when we insisted that he check for the show once ( tony aware winner this past year ) he magically produced center orchestra tix for the same .
