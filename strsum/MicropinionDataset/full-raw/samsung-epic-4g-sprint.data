this is the most solid phone i have ever owned firstly , if you are looking at these reviews completely disregard the 0    2 stars  .
it seems that those people have no idea how to fully utilize this great phone and just complain on things that they do not understand i'll start with the negative , this phone is a bit pricey , and a little bulky  .
but if you're not willing to shell out some cash for this state    of    the    art phone , then you just don't understand smartphones  .
i do not like the bottom touch panel with the lighted back , home , search , and properties buttons  .
it is just something i have to get used to  .
i would rather have actual buttons one thing i just didn't enjoy is the back key located on the left side of the manual keyboard  .
maybe i have big thumbs and i just keep accidentally hitting it , but i feel that the button itself is out    of    place on to the positives  before i begin , what i do and recommend everyone with experience do with these types of smartphones is to get rid of the bloatware  .
to do that you must root the phone , i am not going to explain how that is done , you can search for that on the internet  .
be warned that obtaining root and super user access to the phone's operating system may void your warranty after i got rid of all the sprint garbage , sprinttv , nascar , sprintnavigation , sprintzone , and anyhting i saw fit  .
the phone's average boot time is 15 to 20 seconds from a cold start  .
that blew my mind 2  .
1 (eclair) vs 2  .
2 (froyo) this is a huge subject  .
i see a lot of people complaining and wanting 2  .
why this device is listed as 2  .
2 on the sprint homepage is beyond me  .
it still ships with 2  .
most people do not realize that 2  .
2 is really unstable as of late  .
there are a lot of bugs associated with 2  .
2 and the epic , such as stock browsing , gps locking issues (poor navigation)  .
sure , 2  .
2 is rated 200% faster than 2  .
1 with the jit compiler and other additions in functionality , but in my opinion , i believe that you will benefit greatly by leaving it at 2  .
1 and waiting for a better , more stable release of 2  .
2 , or just wait for 2  .
3 altogether  .
battery life in 2  .
2 is also a major issue 720p video capture  .
this is mind    blowing  .
a cellphone that can take standard quality video  .
i feel like that is enough said adobe flash  .
this is a huge for mobile web browsing  .
not only is it flash capable out    of    the    box , but it runs google earth out    of    the    box as well 5mp camera  .
this is just icing on the cake  .
it has great quality and great resolution for a phone  .
but it's no dslr , don't get picky 4g    if you don't have 4g coverage in your area , then you're missing out  .
the browsing speeds , and download speeds are unfathomable with this phone did i mention it came with 16gigs of memory , stock  .
it does  .
some miscellaneous positive things    .
i like the slide cover for the usb port  .
it really prevents all the earcrust and stuff that might get in there from average use  .
i did not like the samsung moment's usb port cover  .
i do not like the fact that the usb port is on the top of the phone , sometimes i talk when it's plugged in and it just gets in the way  .
it really belongs on the bottom  .
i like the fact that samsung opted again for a full    sized earphone jack  .
when you pick up this phone you'll be surprised at it's weight  .
it looks big , but its not all that heavy  .
my samsung moment and htc touchpro were both heavier the keyboard is really solid , and responsive  .
the layout took some getting used to from my moment , but it really seems to get the job done  .
i like the directional pad , i missed that from my htc touchpro and i like having actual number buttons instead of being forced to use the function key i've owned this phone for about 2 weeks  .
i have gotten only 1 os freeze that forced a battery pull , 0 force closes , 0 dropped calls , 0 data freezes , 0 gps signal losts to anyone who would like to have an experience similar to mine    .
root the phone  .
delete all unwanted bloatware (only possible after rooting phone)  .
here's a list of what i removed using a file manager  .
i deleted the apks located in /system/app    .
sprinttv  .
sprint navigation  .
sprintzone  .
sprintnascar  .
pretty much anything that says sprint is safe to remove 3  .
download the following apps    .
google earth  .
opera mini    for quick web browsing  .
dolphin hd browser    for full flash    rich browsing  .
spare parts    increases battery life and speeds up performance  .
remote rdp , remote vnc , allows logging on to remote computers (difficult setup required)  .
titanium backup    for consistent backups of all your apps and data  .
tikl    push    to    talk program for anyone with an android phone  .
beautiful widgets    brings back memories for any former htc touchpro users  .
enjoy  .
tell your friends  .
this is a solid phone , and to anyone who disagrees   i would love to hear your response , and i will retort accordingly  .
enjoy this phone  .
updated  .
on nov 19 , 2010  .
cool phone , awesome graphics  .
great market just get it already  .
great phone , great coverage with sprint (mainly used in colorado)  .
well worth the extra 10 bucks a month to run (still cheaper than the other big 3 carriers) .
i love this phone every thing i expected and then some  .
just like i said in the pros they keyboard is probably one of the best keyboards on a phone on the market  .
i actually like the media hub because there hasnt been a phone really out there that could compete with the fact that iphones can download full movies  .
there is also a work around for downloading free movies on to the device (cant tell me secrets)  .
youtube video quality is great , of course when you first click on the video it plays in standard quality instead of hq , but all you have to do is click the menu button to change to hq  .
playing angry birds on this phone never gets old  .
the picture quality is really good , i'm able to capture moments of my kids playing and having fun with the 5 mp camera  .
for you who say that the video chatting is horrible , i did agree to that until i downloaded tango tango is an app that is compatible with both android and iphones  .
the video calling is far superior to that of qik and fring  .
on the 3g it works decently , under wifi its more responsive , havent tested under 4g seeing that dc hasnt launched it yet and i havent been to richmond in forever .
you cant find a better smart phone with this many features  .
this is the best phone out right now by far  .
the camera alone with 720p video is top notch  .
this phone has the fastest 1ghz processor and the best gpu  .
along with the best screen and fastest boot time  .
2 cameras and tons of camera options  .
samsungs media hub for movies and tv shows plus a great youtube app  .
sprint nav and google nav preloaded  .
live wallpapers will drop jaws  .
the led is the brightest on any phone so if you need a flash light the epic has it  .
and it comes with a 16gb sd card so use it now and take it with you when you upgrade a year or 2 from now because the epic is future proof  .
and 4g speeds is just the icing on the cake 7to8 mbs on average where im located and the phone just flies  .
the epic 4g is trully epic  .
i don't know what's up with the 1    star reviewer who think that people are paid to rate this phone 5 stars  .
it's not the phone's fault that his area doesn't have 4g or phone reception  .
i consider myself a power user , more or less  .
there are things i haven't tried yet that wo not be addressed in this review (gps , using it as a hotspot , video chat) i is a blackberry user , then tried the samsung transform  .
i'm a big social networker , phone user and texter  .
transform is ok but i felt the need for a faster processor and switched to epic  .
the epic offered much more than i expected  .
it is physically much more comfortable to use  .
the keyboard slides open much smoother than the transform and keys are easier to use  .
i love the swype feature (one reason i opted for epic over evo)  .
the 4g is significantly fast  .
friends and family love the phone call quality , even on speaker phone  .
the voice search function works well  .
the camera comes with a lot of different settings  .
the amoled screen is sooooo nice and very responsive  .
if i find any complaints , i'll update this review  .
right now i'm super happy with the epic and with sprint service .
must have  .
i have had and used many smart phones including the iphone  .
this phone is the best smart phone i have had yet  .
it is fast , effective and all around awesome  .
it actually out preforms my laptop for some things  .
the data plan is cheaper then verizon or at t's with 3g coverage as a staple and 4g as a coming soon  .
well worth the cost  .
the any mobile any time (having unlimited data gives me unlimited talk to all cellphones within the usa) is an awesome perk as well i bought the phone at radio shack (or you can go to best buy for the same deal) because they do instant rebates  .
basically i spend $250 for the phone , not $350 and then wait for a stupid rebate  .
long story short , my only regret is that i did not get this phone sooner .
the screen is amazing  .
the keyboard is definitely a great feature , though it is not completely necessary because of the swype technology  .
the android os is great because it allows you to add your own touch to what you want th screens to look like  .
i use launcher pro and i have to say it makes the device look and operate very similar to an iphone , and the screen looks better than the iphone's new retina display overall i do not think there is a better android phone on the market .
if you take the time and explore all the features the samsung epic you will find that it has 9  .
98% of what you need in a communication device  .
it just missing the 2  .
2 update which will enhance the epic in an awwwh way  .
this is not your ordinary cell phone  .
as an ex    htc evo user , the samsung epic wins all the way around  .
i is concerned when i bought the evo but now i am at ease with the epic  .
epically happy  .
the keyboard is wow , really wonderful  .
and the screen is so right  .
this phone is platinum shelf product  .
well done samsung  .
the epic is full of amazing features , it will take sometime to go through .
my ex wife has the evo now she too wonders why  .
do not get me wrong i think the evo is great but i also believe that it relied too much on the 4  .
3in screen  .
in short i feel that samsung with its galaxy s line just reset the bar by the time everyone else will had caught up samsung would've made some improvments of their own  .
cannot wait for the 2  .
2 upgrade to come available  .
then what  .
don't believe all the people who say that they are disappointed in the battery life  .
it's true that when i first got the phone the battery would not last a fell day  .
then i removed sprintzone , sprinttv and all the other bloatware apps that sprint forces on your phone  .
once i removed these apps , my battery life almost tripled in order to remove this bloatware , you need to do two things , though , as you cannot just remove the apps  .
you need to gain root access to your phone  .
to get the free software , google one click root  .
then you will need to buy the root manager app (it's about $2)  .
then you can remove whatever you want , just be careful not to remove anything critical  .
you can google apps that are safe to remove on epic for help figuring out what is safe to remove .
this is a phone that anyone can be proud to own  .
the big screen makes the virtual keyboard very easy to use , along with the keyboard it also has swipe , the qwerty keyboard , and talk to text which is very accurate  .
the super amoled screen looks fantastic , it's great to watch movies , youtube vids , look at pictures ect  .
the screen is also very responsive , so you don't have to really push on it for a response , the screen doesn't lag (unless you have too many apps running in the background , )  .
for the people like me who are worried that they will drop the phone on concrete and ruin the amoled screen , it is protected by a very durable gorilla glass which can withstand a lot of damage before even scratching (but i still got a screen protector   p )  .
web browsing is very fast (and also looks great on the screen)  .
the camera takes great photos , and video and it comes with an led flash  .
it has access to the android market which has thousands of apps on it  .
the touchwiz ui is very easy to navigate through  .
apps are easy to find in the apps list  .
a task killer and uninstaller are both pre    loaded into the phone so you do not have to download either one from the app market , but i did because i wanted to the call quality is very clear , and texting is great with swipe  .
battery life is really good , especially for me since i am a heavy user  .
the only thing wrong with this phone is the gps but like i said in the cons , android 2  .
2 is supposed to fix it  .
but other than that you cannot possibly go wrong with this phone  .
i highly recommend it .
hand down this is the best android device out  .
it uses the same speedy processor found in the iphone 4 , plus adds a better graphics chip  .
the screen is wonderful , and can even be seen in direct sunlight so what stops it from getting 5 stars  .
really only two things , but they are big enough that it could sway you  .
the first is a foolish decision on samsungs part to only provide 1 gb of internal storage  .
that means until they release the android 2  .
2 update , you have under 1 gb to store your apps  .
on the bright side , once the update comes it should take care of the storage issue  .
the second problem is not so easily fixed , sprints network  .
sprint has the best deals , but coverage can be an issue  .
4g is only in a few select cities , so most people won't ever experience it  .
as for 3g and voice , coverage is smaller than both verizon and att  .
on the bright side you can roam on verizon , but if you roam constantly sprint cuts you off  .
my advice is to check the sprint map before buying  .
oh andbefore any smart ass says i should review the phone , not sprint    a great phone with no service is worse than a crappy phone with great service , so its worth mentioning overall  .
if you have sprint coverage you wo not regret this purchase and will even save some money vs verizon or att .
the biggest thing for me about this phone is the verstility and the fact that my old blackberry dropped calls daily while i is in my home  .
so far ; i have not had a single dropped call with this awesome phone  .
in short , the epic lives up to its name sake and is clearly among the top five android phones on the market today  .
i would rival this against the iphone 4 , evo , droid x , droid incredible , or any other phone on the market  .
batter life is impressive so far too i is skeptical because i have been a blackberry guy for years  .
i have no regrets with my change over .
the samsung epic is , till now , the best android phone out there large display , super amoles , full qwerty keyboard , android 2  .
1 (and soon 2  .
2) 5mp camera with auto focus and led flash , front facing camera and many things more makes this phone the best one and a great mobile experience .
this phone is worth every penny , i have used the evo , iphone 4 , hero and touch pro 2 and it really puts them all to shame  .
samsung did fantastic with this phone there is no other phone on the market i would trade it for .
it is well worth the wait  .
we have multiple sprint phones the galaxy s epic 4g is by far the best phone i have ever seen no matter the carrier that included a keyboard  .
sprint has been great at releasing quality android devices  .
my company has provided me an iphone and the quality of the epic surpasses the iphone 4 the graphics processor and ability to run java and adobe flash make this phone the best gaming phone i have ever seen the 16gb memory card ships with the epic so it makes for a compelling reason to upgrade to this device  .
i will last the two year life cycle of a cell phone price   i buy all of my phones at best buy so they cover the mail in rebate for me  .
i love the fact that i do not have to wait for the rebate to come back to me  .
250  .
00 is a small price to pay for a phone that is better than most of the laptops i have ever owned .
this phone , like many other android    based phones , can do it all  .
i have a high preference for a qwerty keyboard , am wowed by the screen and love the overall feel of the phone with solid construction but not too heavy ; it seems right    sized  .
for example , the evo struck me as a little large for every day wear tear of phone i'm looking forward to 2  .
2 and seeing if they do anything to improve gps signal but delighted with it right now .
1 person complained of email issues , at first , it wasnt synching , but as a few hours passed , things came to notifying me exactly on time , as a matter of fact about 10 seconds before i got email in my computer based gmail account thickness is not an issue it has a keyboard lol  .
i welcome the size of the device  .
perfect  .
this devices are getting bigger because of need to have a computer/laptop like experience to do things , see things we need to get use to these sizes , about average for all the droid phones from epic to droid x etc if you have a droid with a keyboard expect added thickness for it which i welcome otherwise typing without on this phone is difficult because i have bigger thumbs i guess enjoy this phone  .
best on market  .
i have had several smart phones (palm centro , palm pre , htc mogul , and bb curve) and the epic smokes all  .
the best thing is the oled screen  .
if you are looking for a do it all phone , look no futher  .
compared this phone heavily to the iphone 4 and it to me its a no contest unless you have a mac or a lot of itunes stuff  .
its a powethouse for sure  .
well worth the $250 , even with sprints terrible customer service lol  .
by far the best of all smartphones imho  .
4g , beautiful display , real keyboard  .
i do feel a bit guilty still supporting google , they are big brother in case you haven't noticed , they control the information , the cia ai not got jack on goog and well still better than giving a penny to steve jobs i can create and edit , office docs , pdf's  .
i just discovered in the contacts if you click a the media tab you can see their facebook pics , vids , tweets , status w/o opening fb the quick launch rocks uh webos anyone  .
pinch zoom finally  .
combined email finally , true forwading with option to edit fwd attachments  .
i can reply to an exchange email using my google , yahoo account by clicking a dropdown from account audio/video a+ for a phone sd card access w/o removing battery (16 gig card included)  .
i used to be a sprint hater but even with the 10$ extra i still save 30 / month vs  .
vzw and no problems with service even in canada and mexico  .
bottom line    best phone since the pre , glad i passed on the evo  .
this entire review done from my epic  .
the best  .
worthy to invest the money  .
i highly recommend this phone to the holdouts from the htc evo 4g phone  .
it has a slide out physical keyboard and does pretty much everything that the evo does  .
the only other phone that i would purchase would be the nokia n900 , but the sprint network does not use sim cards  .
i am really happy to have the samsung epic 4g phone instead and i just know that anybody who gets this phone would be happy with it also updated  .
on sep 4 , 2010  .
its processor is fast , display second to iphone retina but its keyboard is one of the best in the history of all small device keyboards  .
the feature that i mostly use it for is hotpot , wi    fi , which replaces verizon mi    fi for me  .
overall , a great phone and i do not see why would anyone not like it .
evo number (1) epic number (2)  .
i previously owned the moment , which is a good first android phone for me since i is switching from blackberry  .
the moment cannot even compare to the epic  .
the battery life is so much better  .
i had to keep my moment on the charger all day at work or else the battery would go dead  .
i also had the battery port on the moment go out a few times  .
so i had 4 moments before i got the epic  .
i wanted the evo but i is hesitant about giving up my full qwerty keyboard  .
so when the epic came out , i made my reservation just in case i wanted it , and i am glad i went with the epic  .
i don't even use the qwerty keyboard , thanks to swype the color is wonderful and i like that i have seven rotating screens instead of just the three and watching things in hd is very nice  .
i am still trying to figure all the ins and outs of the phone , which will take some time  .
i do not mind that i have to pay the extra 10 bucks a month , it's well worth it overall i am very pleased with my purchase cost a lot but it is a good investment  .
ive had the iphone 4 and i didnt think a phone can get better until i got the epic  .
the only feature the iphone 4 may have over the epic may be facetime but facetime cant be used over 3g  .
my whole family has the evo and it just isnt better than the epic because of the display and the battery life  .
the best phone on the market  .
this is the best galaxy s phones and best anrdroid so far , beautiful screen , very well built , very very fast , kills the droid x just return it for this phone and no regrets , keyboard is really good , apps open really fast , browser is excellent and real fast , you cannot go wrong with this phone , samsung finally gives us want we wanted on a android phone .
this is my 4th android phone so far the best of all , super fast browser and applications open fast with no lags , excellent screen , best keyboard on a phone , very light and well built , call quality is excellent , i sent my evo back for this phone all i can say is that it is way better than the evo 4g , i think this phone combines everything every one wants on a phone into the epic 4g , love this phone .
i is on 4 waiting lists for an evo since june  .
as a pretty happy palm pre user for over a year , i is really looking forward to moving up to evo  .
then i got word of the epic and it's real keyboard  .
i reserved one for the launch yesterday  .
last night my friend and i went straight to the sprint store after work  .
they actually had 2 evos in stock so we could do some serious comparing  .
when i handled the epic and it's keyboard , my choice is made for me  .
really the only thing i could see that the evo had over the epic is an 8 megapixel camera vs 5  .
no biggie for me  .
the phone is incredible and does so much , so fast  .
here in l  .
we don't have g4 yet but i'm told it's coming by the end of the year i can wait  .
g3 is pretty darn fast anyway  .
there are so many apps (hundreds of free ones) , that i'm in shopping heaven  .
it hasn't even been 24 hours , i've lost sleep playing with it hope my boss does not get wind of how much play time i'm having here at work  .
the only thing i'm missing so far from my palm pre is the ability to have several applications open minimized  .
that is so incredibly handy but i'll get over it  .
bottom line , my friend (who also bought one last night) were like 2 kids in a candy store  .
every time we were shown something new we giggled with delight excitement  .
when we used the video chat to talk on the phone to each other sprint could have shot a commercial right there  .
if you're considering an android that does everything get this phone  .
i just bought the phone at full price ($549) at radio shack because i had just upgraded to the evo about a month ago  .
let me tell you , the epic is truly epic  .
imo it's much better then the evo  .
it's smoother , quicker , and still only has 2  .
1 , just imagine it with froyo  .
the screen is worth it's weight in gold and the keyboard along with swype gives it an amazing 1    2 punch that gives it's users the best of both worlds  .
it's lighter then the evo and feels better in the hand  .
anyone who doubts this phone needs to just go down and try it out  .
my opinion in just two words  .
simply amazing  .
best smartphone to date if you require a physical keyboard the phone is a data   and even with multiple syncing items , running apps , the phone's processor does not slow like older android models on the market the 10 dollar premium data charge is forgivable when you weigh the video chat , 4g market speeds on data , ability to use as a hotspot with monthly charge (with 4g speeds) , etc  .
its still cheaper than any competitor on the market ( a la cart or add on data packs)  .
hands down the winner for the smartphones , til the next gen models come out late 4thq 2010 .
if you want the best , this is the phone .
bueno me gusta por el teclado fisico creo que eso le ayuda mucho  .
i have some concerns about the use of costly data plans as a con for the phone in the cnet review  .
it's only costly if you're a current sprint subscriber , and by costly nicole means $10 more a month  .
compare unlimited plans of verizon , t    mobile and at t , even with the additional $10 charge , and sprint is still cheaper than the other three  .
that's a bit unfair , especially as we have yet to see what the others will do with their 4g networks when/if they have them up and running .
the bottom    line is this is one of the best smartphones on the market with a company that saves you money during these hard times  .
nicole lee comment on the bad (the samsung epic 4g is the bulkiest of the galaxy s phones and also the priciest  .
it also requires a costly data plan  .
) is just not fair at all  .
bulkiest compared to other galaxy s phones that don't have slide out keyboard  .
why not compare it to other phones with slide out keyboards like the motorola droid  .
and the priciest part again is wrong , so you pay what and extra $50 but end of saving $1 , 200 in the price plan because your on sprint instead of verizon wireless and at t  .
don't drink the koolaid , do some of your own research , because you will find out that cnet is not always right  .
they are they best and i look to them all the time , but they are human  .
i have the htc evo and i love it  .
and i looked at enough reviews on this phone , to know that it going to be a winner  .
i have been on vzw and att before and what i have found out is they all are pretty much the same , an utility company  .
have no loyalty to companies , have loyalty to great product at fair prices  .
that what you get if you buy this phone or the htc evo  .
droid iphone are great phones , it just that they do not have a big enough difference to make a difference if you know what i mean  .
put your concern on the plan and coverage that what really matters  .
i'm loving sprint right now because i am saving a total of $1 , 800 a year because i can got rid of my iphone (which is more of an entertainment phone , that an organization phone) ($140 per month) and my comcast internet ($80 per month)  .
think about what you can do with all that extra cash and have one of the best smartphone ever made  .
i highly recommend it  .
almost everyone whom i've shown my epic says , now i hate my phone , i've gotta get one  .
i could be a salesman .
best os , best price/features  .
consider this smartphone if you wear reading glasses  .
the large display and full qwrty keyboard make it one of the few smartphones that are friendly to those that need the larger numbers and display  .
i love the feature that senses that you are talking and the cellphone and prevents your cheek from accidentally hanging up or activating apps on accident  .
i ditched an htc touchscreen because of that .
i have had this phone for one month and i am still find more surprises this phone can do  .
i have to say samsung went all out on this phone .
i love the screen , the speed , the camera , the keyboard , the apps  .
i usually change phones every 6 months  .
i can honestly say that i will keep this phone longer than that  .
this is a rare instance of a piece of technology mostly living up to all the hype  .
unfortunately , it has a pretty steep learning curve for people not familiar with android style smart phones , and it's not a contraption for someone who just wants to make phone calls  .
however , it's remarkably powerful , and despite all the negative press about battery life , battery life is not bad , as long as you're not using heavy 4g access  .
the flexibility of your various desktop surfaces (endless customization options) is a big plus  .
additionally , given the huge installed user base for android phones , i suspect you're going to see actually more applications on this user interface compared to iphone or at least equivalent  .
despite all the high    technology , voice quality (incoming) is average at best , although outgoing voice quality is fairly good  .
bluetooth sound quality is better than average one of my complaints is that it is not easy to synchronize outlook with the calendar on the phone , and i had to first synchronize through a google mail account , and from there , once on the web , calender information is updated quickly to the phone's calender however it is bizarre (in my judgment) that you cannot simply plug the phone into your laptop and find a basic os function that allows music , photos , outlook contacts , calendar , and anything else that you elect to be transferred over  .
it is amazing to me that you can get an application that is free to read barcodes or identify tunes but you cannot get a free application that allows easy synchronization  .
perhaps there is one , but i have not found it yet all in all , it's an impressive piece of hardware and software .
i have to disagree with the reviewer who wrote this review about her views of the value of sprint  .
it is stated in the cons of this phone that it is a con that you have to pay a costly data plan  .
if you hop on to the websites of different mobile providers and build a plan , it's easy to see that sprint is the best value  .
for much less each month , you have unlimited mobile to mobile with any other mobile carrier as a complimentary feature , unlimited data (once again , let's see your iphone do that) , and only $10 data add on  .
my monthly bill comes to about $85 a month  .
to get the same features on any other carrier (minus the any mobile any time) oh yeah , and i love the phone  .
maybe it doesnt have hdmi out or 7 homescreens on 1 page like the evo , but who really uses hdmi out on a phone  .
the phone has all the features i need and more  .
i'm a regular guy who uses the phone to test , email , facebook and the occasional phone call , and the epic works beautifully for me  .
updated  .
on sep 29 , 2010  .
this phone made me glad i stayed with sprint .
ok i see some of these reviews that say all but this phone is a pos and (imo) from some of the complaints it seems that a lot of the real neg  .
reviews are from first time andriod users or first time smart phone users  .
i had a bb bold 9650 i dumped for the epic , that phone was not even close to the quality and performance of the epic  .
is the evo a better phone  .
in some areas , is the epic better than the evo  .
in some areas , every review done by phone web sites , and andriod websites all say the same thing , both phones have their up's and down's , but to flat out call the epic a failure , or the evo for that matter , may just be you got a bad phone , try another , i know someone who bought a new $52 , 000 lexus , it had more problems than a used yugo , but that dosen't mean that all lexus' are bad cars  .
if your phone is not working right , you shold know before the 30 days are up , just do not take no for an answer from the sprint store , get another , i had to go through 3 evo's before i got a good one .
any way you slice it , this is a really good phone first , let me address touchwiz  .
this is my first go    round with android and i'm glad it's on there  .
maybe it looks to colorful or cartoonish for some , but i find it to be functional  .
touchwiz is made for the first time android user  .
it makes using the phone easy to figure out  .
maybe some of the functionality is missing from a vanilla android experience , but i'll never know  .
and i bet i'd never miss it  .
i'll never be a super    user ; so i am satisfied as for performance , i haven't had any issues  .
generally whatever i press , to go to whichever app is almost instant  .
i've downloaded probably 30 apps already (love the market  .
there are a couple of things you can do to make sure this happens  .
first , go into settings and turn off transitions , or at the very least choose show some secondly , if you tap and hold the home button , it will bring up the 6 most recently used apps and a task manager button  .
you can end any running apps within task manager  .
a samsung widget called program monitor can be added to your home screen which will show you the number of apps running and color coded cpu usage  .
also , you can go under settings , applications and running services and shut down any running services in the background for better battery life , i would suggest getting an app to help you out with that  .
i have the juice defender free version which turns off 3g when the phone is in stand    by (turns it on for 1 min every 15 mins to check for data)  .
that alone has significantly helped improve the battery life  .
with moderate use , (downloading just a few apps , a couple of short phone calls , some app usage throughout the day , etc  .
) i can get through the day on a single charge with battery power to spare  .
i also turn the phone off when i charge it at night i really enjoy having the option of a physical keyboard  .
it is perfect for long emails or writing out journal entries (which is what i really wanted it for)  .
a 4 row keyboard really makes a difference  .
for everyday texts or browser functions i use swype  .
i cannot say enough good things about swype  .
it's so quick and easy to use i find myself forgetting to use shorthand when texting  .
not only that , but after 2 weeks of use , i about have the location of all the letters on a qwerty keyboard memorized  .
if you've never used it , give it a try the call quality on the phone is good  .
i did have some issues with tinny    ness (  .
) in the beginning , but it went away  .
however , the speakerphone has this issue pretty bad  .
it's not unusable by any means , but it is kind of annoying as far as gps , i have not had any issues  .
my gps works great and and the other day told me it is accurate within 30 meters (approx  .
98 feet)  .
while driving when i came up on a turn , it told me to turn  .
i had no problems getting to my destination  .
although , the speakerphone issue comes into play here if you have voice navigation turned on  .
sometimes it sounded a little garbled if you haven't watched the galaxy s drop/scratch test on youtube , you really should  .
they put the phone through it's paces and it held up really well  .
since i watched this video , i did not purchase a case , which keeps my phone slim and pocketable  .
unlike my easily scratched dare , i already know it will take more than keys to scratch up the face of the phone  .
coincidentally , i is out at a bar about 5 days after i purchased the phone and a friend knocked the phone off a bar table  .
the phone landed on the concrete floor bounced and flipped over onto its face (i swear it happened in slow motion , with my face frozen in horror) and the battery cover popped off  .
i picked up the phone and there was not a scratch on the screen    or anywhere else for that matter  .
i popped the battery cover back on and went about the evening  .
the phone worked just fine after  .
whew  .
in summary , the phone has a few minor issues (have not found one that is perfect yet) , but overall , i think the epic from samsung is a great phone updated  .
on sep 17 , 2010  .
purchased my samsung epic 4g a few days ago and have been using it quite extensively over the last few days  .
this is my second android device (the first being a mytouch 3g fender edition from tmobile)  .
overall , i have really enjoyed my experience with the phone and most of my complaints are minimal or out of samsung's direct control and i'll get into those in a moment to start , i'd like to talk about what comes with the phone   the charger , micro    usb to usb cable , and a pair of headphones  .
now the charger and cable are rather standard fare but the headphones were rather impressive (in terms of bundled headphones)  .
i have a strange mutation in my ears that results in me not having that small flap of skin at the bottom of my outer ear to hold in the regular style earbud headphones and they always fall out  .
as a result i've always had to use more expensive in    ear style earbuds  .
i have never found a product with bundled headphones i could use let alone that i would be happy using enter the samsung epic  .
the headphones are a little bassy to be completely honest but they are in    ear meaning the provide very basic , very minimal noise reduction  .
so that is a huge plus for me  .
now to the actual phone  .
as i said , prior to this i is using a mytouch 3g fender edition running stock 1  .
6 android  .
it did what i needed it to but it is always slow and kind of chunky feeling on the software side  .
when i first booted up the phone i noticed off the bat how gosh darn quick it got went from off to usable (obviously a result of the 1ghz hummingbird under the hood) a lot of people dislike samsung's touchwiz interface and prefer htc's senseui  .
i haven't used a lot of senseui so i cannot really comment on how it works but i can say that while there are a few things i dislike about how touchwiz works (side scrolling app window , inability to configure the message quicklaunch to do handcentsms rather than stock messaging , inability to configure the social networking feed's color from pink , etc ) but in terms of overall experience i feel it works very well the two biggest annoyances i've found in the phone were the gps and occasional failing of the touchscreen to respond to well , touches  .
the gps issue is actually not samsung's fault as google now requires all phones to come with the use wireless networks (menu location security) box unchecked which results in the phone being essentially unable to locate itself  .
its a simple fix that took me a little looking online to figure out but it is still rather annoying second is the screen  .
a few times i've found myself touching something (most times its been the sliding to unlock feature) and getting no response  .
its frustrating and should not be something someone working on a touchscreen device should have to worry about but its nothing more than a small annoyance as it always is remedied in a few moments i would also like to touch on the overall gps issue with the galaxy phones  .
it is a well known fact that the agps on the two earliest galaxy s phones (the captivate and the vibrant) basically do not have functioning gps or do not have near enough accuracy to use the feature at all  .
a lot of reports have said that this issue is fixed for the epic 4g but sadly i cannot comment either way as my area has already terrible gps reception but in my tests it has performed about the same as my mytouch 3g the phone also come with sprint hotspot which i've tried on a few occasions with varying success  .
while driving in a good coverage area i attempted to use it in congruence with an ipod touch to no avail  .
it is able to connect but not able to actually get on the internet  .
the next day i tried it at my home where i have 3g coverage in a static location and is able to connect my laptop via the hotspot but the connection is extremely slow in both finding the wireless network and in actual connection speed  .
when i attempted to run a speakeasy speed test i is unable to get a connection (this is during the writing of this review) finally , a note on 4g  .
when i upgraded my phone i is told i would have to pay an extra $10 a month for 4g coverage however i know that the 4g coverage in washington state ends about 40 miles northwest of me  .
i asked if the salesman is serious as again , i do not have 4g coverage so why should i have to pay for it and he assured me that coverage will be coming soon  .
now , i know not to put too much weight behind what sales reps told me (in january tmobile reps repeated told me the nexus one would be in store by march) but it would be nice to get 4g coverage  .
also , i'll be moving to phoenix after i graduate college and that area is not covered by 4g at all its frustrating to have paid for a phone that can do 4g and be paying a monthly fee to give me access to 4g but to find that i cannot actually use it  .
that is my biggest complaint and sprint seems to think it wo not be a complaint for much longer  .
i can only hope that they are right .
i love it .
overall , by far the best phone i have ever had  .
i've had windows mobile ce up to 6  .
5 , blackberry , and palm , i've used webos (which is nice) but android blows everything else away  .
i tried waiting for windows phone 7 , but could not do it , and i am happy that i went with this phone .
let me start off by saying i have never owned a smart phone before , but i have researched several phones comparable to the epic 4g and i am loving it  .
i did mention some cons , but they  .
re really more like little annoyances rather than major cons  .
as everyone knows , battery life is going to be an issue for any phone with the epic  .
s feature set (i  .
evo 4g , iphone 4 , droid x , etc)  .
so , battery life should not really be considered a con specific to this phone alone  .
i also mentioned volume control , which on the epic , is a dedicated volume rocker located on the left side of the device  .
in my opinion , i think an on    screen volume controller should also be available  .
next , the only way to reactivate the screen is by pressing the unlock button or sliding out the qwerty keyboard  .
considering how many times a screen times out , i  .
m afraid that daily usage will cause the button and/or sliding mechanism to ware out quickly ok , now that i  .
ve gotten the bad stuff out of the way i can get to the good stuff  .
the epic 4g rocks  .
s a solid , fun , feature    packed phone that has everything i could ever want or expect from a handheld device  .
the display is absolutely phenomenal  .
watching videos , viewing pictures , surfing the net , or playing games is a totally different experience due in large part to the super amoled screen , resolution , and clarity  .
armed with a 1g hummingbird processor , the epic  .
s responsiveness is unlike anything i  .
ve ever experienced  .
s fast , super fast  .
pinch    to    zoom is on par with any other device in the market to date  .
then there  .
s swype  .
ve turned from a heavy physical keyboard user to an on    screen keyboardaholic thanks to the ease and intuitiveness of swype  .
finally , i have to mention the camera because it is excellent  .
pictures come out clear , crisp , and dare i say just as good as any average point shoot camera on the market bottom line , the epic 4g is an awesome phone  .
it deserves all the accolades it  .
s gotten and worth every penny  .
on a side note , even though 4g is not available in my area yet the additional $10 is not much to swallow as the plan is still less than other carriers updated  .
on sep 18 , 2010  .
the epic 4g is the media powerhouse and it is probably the best android phone out in the market  .
the screen is a major upgrade from the samsung moment , omg its already been more than a year since that came out , and the screen is a flawless display for multimedia the epic 4g similar to other android phones is horrible for microsoft outlook and exchange  .
bridging meetings is harder to do on these phones and grabbing mail is even harder since you need to turn off the email sync my bottom line is get it before the next hot phone comes out ,  .
the moment with 2  .
1 put a bad taste for android and samsung in my mouth and the evo was not the best device either  .
i ended up retuning the evo and i honestly bought this phone expecting it to have the same fate  .
now that i have had the phone for a few days i would not dream of returning it  .
i've owned many phones and have used every mobile operating system (aside from bada and symbian) thoroughly  .
this phone has easily claimed the top dog position on my list  .
it is amazingly fast for an android 2  .
1 handset , i cannot wait to have a formal 2  .
2 rom come out  .
i will proudly carry this phone in my pocket for a long time if samsung releases a version of gingerbread for it note   the touchwiz launcher itself is fairly mediocre but the additions samsung has made to the ui on the dialer and menus all throughout the phone are bound to become an industry standard  .
in order to fix the touchwiz launcher problem download launcher pro as a replacement .
just to say it if like great definition awesome speed and insane apps is just great  .
really happy with it  .
first of all , i must give kudos to sprint  .
they shipped my phone overnight for free  .
free activation as well  .
(no wonder i've been a sprint customer for over 5 years  .
i just received this phone yesterday and my initial impression is wow  .
i came from the touch pro 2 which runs windows mobile 6  .
5 and let me tell you android is so much better and faster  .
the screen on the epic is , well , epic  .
(pun intended)  .
the charging port is on the top which is a bit strange but i suppose if you're a seasoned ipod user , this won't bother you too much  .
i'm not one who gets nit    picky over tiny details , i'm more concerned with the way the phone operates and so far i'm loving what i see  .
it comes with a 16gb microsd card preinstalled which is great as well  .
with the touch pro 2 , i ran into all kinds of storage issues like i said , this is only my initial review but i really do not see it changing much  .
if it does , i'll be sure to update .
this phone contains some amazing features for the money  .
like the evo , yes , it is very large due mainly in part to the 4  .
3 inch super amoled display  .
speaking of the display , it is sharper than most televisions and monitors i have seen , and by far the sharpest of any phone i have seen , including the recent iphone 4  .
the screen also works well in direct sunlight and is very usable outdoors  .
the full qwerty keyboard is a very nice addition , as it makes messaging easier , while saving wear and tear on the screen  .
the phone , even for its incredible size , is lightweight  .
the camera on the back , though it is only 5  .
0mp , beats the evo's camera hands    down by any stretch  .
the camera is more feature    rich than others and takes a clearer , sharper photo  .
video is absolutely amazing  .
the speaker on the phone is loud , and very audible under most conditions , with a bit of a tinny sound noticed in higher octaves  .
the phone's reception seems to be very good , very clear , and the person on the other end did not have issues hearing me  .
of course , the phone connected to wifi and 4g without issue  .
the interface is very nice  .
the hotspot feature is really amazing and easy to set up and use  .
the things it seems to be lacking most are a long    life battery , and an hdmi port , as well as a kickstand for watching tv  .
however , the epic really does overshadow most phones in the industry very easily  .
i would say it is definitely comparable to the evo on most levels , better on others , and quickly overruns the droid x , droid 2 , and the iphone 4 , due mostly in part to the super hi    def display , and the 4g support , along with the front    facing camera and video    chat capabilities updated  .
on sep 2 , 2010  .
my friend has the evo , i had a moment the battery life so far is already knocking the socks off both with high functioning going on  .
the initial charge (that the battery came with    less than half) lasted several pictures and an hour of navigation  .
my moment would not have made that on a full charge  .
neither would an evo , from what i am told  .
the screen is brilliant  .
i am told the super amoled screens can over saturate color  .
maybe    but so far all i have noticed is brilliance and clarity  .
the touch response is awesome (loving the pinching and double taps feature) and it is truly locked out on calls i always had issues with my face doing things (including hanging up) on calls with my moment  .
i got the epic because i is on the waiting list for an evo for three weeks , with none coming in    so i thought i would take a chance and get the epic  .
i needed to go to radio shack , because to get a new phone , i needed to add a line and to switch users/phones , i needed to go to radio shack  .
(sprint's fraud policies restrict you from changing phones/numbers within a plan for 60 days)  .
they were getting evo's in regularly , until it stopped abruptly , and after three weeks of being on the top of the waiting list , i gave up when the epic came out  .
i am not disappointed  .
i see a huge difference between this and the moment    which is the it phone on sprints 3g just 4 months ago ah , the memories  .
) 4 months later , and though the moment is a nice phone , the epic is thinner , even though it is bigger , but not bulky  .
the evo , with both in my hand , only seems a fraction thinner , and not that much lighter feeling  .
the epic will slide into a pocket a tad easier but the 0  .
3 smaller screen is hardly smallish as reviewed earlier  .
the previous norm of 3  .
2 , now that's smallish  .
i am sure something much better will be coming out in 4 more months but for now , i am more than happy with my smallish bulky epic  .
{snort}  .
i have no idea about this product  .
i just wish people would actually use the product and then bash it and/or write good things about it .
by this time i've had the phone long enough to get bored with some android apps and have deleted them  .
but the ones i've kept have made this a very handy phone  .
i used to carry a pda and a cell , now i just carry this , and everything syncs through google , including calendar , tasks , contacts , and to do list  .
i love sharing my calendar with my secretary and my spouse  .
my spouse has an android phone , so she shares her calendar with me , and we have no more excuses for messing up each other's schedule  .
people looking at the phone especially love the camera and the quality of the pictures  .
with the single cord used for recharging , you can recharge through a usb slot , and even open the sd card from the computer to upload or download files or pictures  .
the bad old days of having to pay extra for all these features once offered separately are now gone with one great device that can do nearly everything in one package , at one price (unless you want to buy some andrid apps)  .
i only wish it could cut and paste when working with text .
overall , i think the phone is the best phone for sprint  .
the display is gorgeous , the customization options are plentiful  .
the only downside to the phone is that it lives on a charger all the time  .
now i bought the phone understanding this fact we all know that these do it all smartphones live on the charger i do not mind if the phone lives on the charger , what i mind is the location of the charger port what the hell kind of drugs is samsung doing when they decided to put the charger port on the top of the phone  .
how stupid can you be  .
it's the most awkward when you're charging your phone and you have to talk on it too (very often for this phone)  .
that has to be the worst location for a charging port other than putting it on a corner of the phone  .
i thought when blackberry put the charging port on the side that is the worst until i met this phone then , to add insult to injury , they put the power button on the side of the phone , where the slider part blocks it a little  .
that is a complete disaster for samsung  .
when the next hot smartphone comes out , that's enough for me to switch from this phone  .
other than that , the keyboard is horrible  .
i never use the physical keyboard because it feels so cheap and big too big  .
overall the phone is good , but those 2 flaws are like basic things that you need for functionality  .
i'll keep it for now but will wait to see what the next must have phone will be .
had my palm for 1 year , and while i loved webos , and the standard features on the phone , the lack of app development for palm , lack of choice for webos phones at this time , and , more importantly , the build quality (power button popped off and got lost) made me look for a new android phone (iphone just was not practical , plus it feels like a status symbol)  .
after testing the evo and the epic , went with the epic mainly for qwerty the good   more solid build compared to the pre  .
finally can get decent apps (and for free)  .
while screen is larger , much lighter than anticipated (does not feel like a brick)  .
has a nice qwerty board that is more expansive  .
interface is much smoother than the pre  .
build quality is solid       does not feel like a toy  .
has an allshare standard , which allows me to get files from my computer via wifi , but admittedly have not tested it yet  .
picture quality from the camera is nice  .
screen is beautiful       almost like hd (depending on content) the bad   battery life       will need a recharge after a day with fair use (though this is similar to my palm and most smartphones)  .
lasts about 4    5 hours with heavy use (e  .
playing games on my phone or using apps with lots of processing , wifi/3g use while waiting for flights)  .
i do miss cardview from palm , which is nice to see which apps were open , rather than having to go to a task manager  .
voicemail quality has been mediocre       sounds like it's coming through a bad metro speaker at times , but admittedly have not used it much variables   i have no 4g in my area , so that has been good on my battery so far  .
have been happy with the free apps i have gotten so far through android , though i wish they had better oem apps like palm did (sticky notes , more info on notifications on e    mail and messages)  .
palm also made going to airplane mode much easier (through status bar) than android (go through settings)  .
am hoping for a better extended battery soon in summary , have been happy with the phone over the last 2 weeks  .
while i do miss some of the conveniences of the pre , they are more than made up for with the 7 customizable home pages , app store , and bigger qwerty board , which is the dealbreaker over the evo (though htcsense is nice wallpaper)  .
this is the best sprint smartphone in my opinion .
i'm still getting use to this phone , its really a great phone  .
like most phones it has it issues but over all its a great phone and im still on my learning curb  .
is there a way to disable the lock screen , so everytime i wake my phone up i dont have to slide up or down to get into the phone  .
take a page from palm pre , using cards for different programs is really useful and easy to go back and forth from web page to photo to text messages etc .
minor issue is not being able to save picture texts to phone  .
having to pay $10 extra month because it is a 4g phone (when it doesnt work most of the time) that service is available in all areas yet  .
worst part of it all , i wanted to ue my phone as a modem hooking it up to my laptop sprint hotspot app and now i find out that i have to pay an extra 29  .
99 a month to do so , even though i have unlimited data usage that is definately a chapper for me  .
other then the phone itself os great  .
love the features , user friendly and all around alot of fun .
great phone for mobile , web savvy , email crazy people  .
the keyboard is one of the best features .
before you read below please read this   make sure you set aside time to play with this  .
your girlfriend or wife is going to hate you for it if you don't  .
haha trust me i learned from experience i is a blackberry user for years , and i never wanted to switch  .
but i wanted to see what 4g is like  .
sprint is testing 4g in many more markets than are on their website (many places in the san francisco area and los angeles)  .
here is a break down of the pros and cons  .
once you get use to swype typing , you'll never use the keyboard  .
i bought this phone becaue of the physical keyboard (since i came from a blackberry) but i never use it  .
swype is great  .
go look up a video 2  .
battery life is pretty good despite what people say  .
since the amoled screen does not use power with black pixels  .
i made my wallpaper solid black  .
improved battery life drastically  .
trust me on this  .
now if you use 4g it drains your battery quickly  .
see below  .
also charging time takes a long time  .
it takes maybe twice as long to fully charge this phone than a blackberry and the mah is only slightly stronger (1500)  .
use the power widget to very easily turn on/off things like 4g , wifi , adjut brightness  .
this will help greatly 3  .
4g it drains your battery , and mean quickly  .
god's honest truth 3g is fast enough  .
i mean 4g is cool to test out , but it really doesn't make a difference when browsing  .
maybe downloading music or video (yes) but how often do you do that  .
when it comes to apps and browsing 3g is fast enough  .
i teathred my phone to my laptop , and the 4g speeds were barely faster than 3g  .
3g speeds were about 1mb per second download  .
4g is 1  .
now if you run a network speedtest on the phone at speedtest  .
net , it's fast 4    5 mbps 3  .
customization    awesome , nothing like it  .
i love it  .
no complaints  .
you'll love it 4  .
feel of the phone    overall a little too thick for me  .
once you add it the protective case , that thing aint goin in your pocket  .
it makes it to thick  .
so if you like a thin phone , this one is not for you  .
as i mentioned above , with the swype technology you'll never find yourself using a keyboard  .
the keyboard also wiggles around a bit 5  .
charging port    kinda funny that's its on top of the phone , but not a big deal 6  .
bluetooth    great quality (3  .
0 bt technology)  .
good reception from a number of bluetooth pieces i've tried  .
it's also cool streaming podcasts /music to your bluetooh  .
cool feature 7  .
apps    app market is great  .
again customizing this phone is one of the greatest features  .
apps will randomly start for some reason  .
i don't know if they suck up battery life or cpu usage  .
the sprint guy told me they do not 8  .
unlocking the phone    phone has an auto lock  .
you have to touch the power button and then slide the screen to unlock  .
get an app on the market for this called screen mode to customize this  .
now i can lock / unlock my phone by just hitting a button 9  .
youtube videos are great to watch on here you can watch them in hq  .
sometimes when you do , you'll have to reset your phone for it to work  .
i know it sounds funny , but this is a minor flaw  .
youtube in hq is great  .
e    mail and web browsing  .
seamlessly hooked up to my company's exchange  .
so much more superior than using a blackberry in that regard  .
the way you can view the e    mails and attachments are great  .
also synced with yahoo and gmail  .
again  .
awesome  .
no complaints 11  .
web browsing    no other phone like it  .
plain and simple it's great 12  .
the google search feature  .
i know this is available on other droid phones  .
but the voice activated or type features are awesome  .
phone reception / quality    perfect overall  .
if you can get over the thickness you'll love it .
i wanted to save others trouble of returning phone as i almost did  .
i experienced irratic touch screen behavior  .
when selecting one area , it would think it is a different one and dragging is the same prob  .
after experimenting more , this only happened when the phone is plugged in the power cord  .
i dont know the logic behind this , but just dont use the phone when plugged in like most smart phones , this thing sucks a lot of energy  .
but its still does better than the htc evo powerwise love it  .
great phone , a little pricey , but sprint has the cheapest data plans out there .
get this phone updated  .
on sep 4 , 2010  .
my overall experience with this phone is positively addicting and i just could not put the device down  .
definitely gonna need a 32 gb card for when i put music and videos on this thing  .
i bought this phone because i wanted an all in one device that could basically do everything  .
so far i have had no failures just minor things that could have been added or changed  .
camera and recording are good for facebooking  .
i can work with the productivity software that comes with the phone but wish word and excel were directly a part of the software suite  .
i am just used to them  .
also it needs more window panes for adding apps  .
should be unlimited with how fast the android market is growing .
i love it  .
it has it's quirks , but it is overall a great phone updated  .
on sep 8 , 2010  .
let's start with , i prefer the webos over android , ios , windows , etc  .
(let the flame wars begin) the quality of the phone hardware is excellent  .
really prefer a physical keyboard over virtual and it has a great keyboard  .
the phone is very fast and responsive i have small hands and the phone is a little bulky when holding but doesn't feel heavy when holding  .
price you pay for a real keyboard  .
being a little bulky , the phone makes a big bulge in pockets the htc sense ui is much better than the samsung one  .
for example , with the sense ui , you can easily have your calendar or other applications fully open on one of the home screens  .
have not found a way to do this with the samsung really needs the upgrade to android 2  .
2 and things like a combined inbox that webos has overall a really good phone and would reccomend to others .
i got this phone this afternoon , and ive been loving it for the whole 9 hours of ive had it  .
i had an htc hero before this and a blackberry curve  .
dont get me wrong they were great phones , and i is skeptical about dropping this amt of cash on a phone but this is crazy great  .
you will love it , no lie  .
im an amateur phone junkie i love switching out and trying new phones all the time , but i know this is by far the best ive had so far , especially running on android  .
my boyfriend has an evo , which is 0  .
3 in bigger , screen wise , and for some reason i always felt like it is too big for my hands , but this is a slightly more rounded shape and is much more comfortable to hold for me  .
i hate touch screen keyboards so the qwerty is heaven for me  .
although i gotta say the swype keyboard is handy , fast , and very great word detection , not to mention fun and great to show off to friends  .
the design is very sleek and sexy , the whole front is shiny black , very stylish  .
all in all , im very happy and plan to stay with this phone for a looong time .
i bought this for my wife when it came out after getting the evo for myself (she had phone jealousy)  .
the epic does not come with widgets that either of us really find as useful as the evo's  .
we are still waiting on software allowing the epic to be able to sync with outlook without having to go through ten steps every time  .
overall , we both like the evo much better .
speed   the fast processor makes everything very responsive  .
no more waiting 2 or 3 seconds for the dial pad to come up to dial a phone number  .
there's even enough processing power left over to have a pretty realistic    looking aquarium as your screen wallpaper without slowing anything down screen   the super amoled screen looks great  .
it even makes a decent e    book reader  .
i got the kindle app and set the color to sepia it feels very similar to reading an e    ink screen camera   the camera takes decent pictures for a phone , and it does have an led flash  .
you can download an app to use the led as a flashlight as well apps   unlike the pre , running webos , the epic runs android , which surpassing iphone as the most widely used phone os  .
there are lots and lots of apps and more coming every day  .
whatever you might want to do on a phone , there's most likely an android app that does it physical keyboard   i like having a physical keyboard  .
this keyboard has nice big buttons and good clicky response  .
the keys are all lined up in a grid , rather than offset like a normal computer keyboard  .
it takes some getting used to but it seem to be ok  .
with the arrow keys and physical home , options , back , and search buttons , you can do just about everything without even touching the touchscreen if you want on    screen keyboard   i have never liked on    screen keyboards , but sometimes you get lazy and don't feel like sliding the phone open just to type one quick word  .
for this reason , i have found myself using the onscreen keyboard more and more  .
it actually works really well , in part because of the large screen  .
and swype is a pretty cool feature  .
instead of tapping each letter , you just slide your finger to spell out words  .
sometimes i feel like i can probably type faster using swype than i can using the physical keyboard wireless reception   this is one negative point of this phone  .
i have only had the palm pre on sprint to compare it to , but the reception on the samsung epic is definitely worse than the palm pre voice   in my apartment i get one or 2 bars fewer than i did with the pre  .
i don't have the best reception in the apartment to begin with , but that's where having a good phone vs  .
a bad one really makes a difference  .
to its credit , i have not yet dropped any calls  .
audio seems very clear  .
i had no complaints of static or dropouts from anyone i talked to  .
the speakerphone is nice and loud and calls sound very clear wi    fi   the wi    fi reception is not great  .
even standing in the same room as my router , i don't always get full bars  .
in the farthest room from the router , i get 1 or zero bars , and sometimes loses the connection altogether  .
my palm pre still gets 1 or 2 bars with no connectivity problems 4g   4g reception doesn't seem to be much better than voice or wi    fi  .
i don't really find myself using it very much anyway  .
it really drains the battery quickly , and 3g is usually fast enough for what i need to do  .
i might turn it on to watch streaming video or broadcast live video on qik  .
it is nice to have the option to use it cost   the phone is not cheap , even if you get your 2    year contract discount  .
on top of the purchase price , and required data plan subscription , there is an extra mandatory data fee of $10 a month  .
this seems reasonable , when you consider that clear chargest $40 for 4g service  .
the problem is that people who don't live in a 4g service area also have to pay the fee  .
for another $30 a month to use the phone as a wireless hotspot , making it about equivalent to the cost of a 4g usb modem from clear size   compared to my palm pre , this phone is a monster  .
but once you get used to it , it's really not that bad  .
if you do a lot of web browsing , watching videos , or gaming , the advantages of having that big , beautiful screen more than make up for the size of the phone  .
and it does still fit in my pocket accessories   for not much money , you can get an extra battery with an external charger  .
this seems like a very good investment  .
there's also a docking station , but i found that when i put the phone in the dock it tends to push the volume down button on the phone  .
not good when i'm on call  .
it didn't really seem any more conventient than just plugging the usb cable directly into the charging port overall i love this phone  .
it is a huge step up from my palm pre  .
the reception may be an issue , but again , i haven't yet had any dropped calls  .
maybe when they upgrade to android 2  .
2 (coming soon , supposedly) it will improve i do not really feel like i need 4g but right now i think the epic and the evo are the only sprint android phones with the fast 1 ghz processor  .
if i had the option , i would probably choose to save the extra $10 per month and forego having 4g .
i had epic on hold for launch date and spent a couple of hours in the store putting it and the evo through some paces  .
i is interested in the hummingbird processor so , having both units set to 4g , ran several videos and tv programs starting both at same time  .
neither loaded faster or played better  .
both do not show them completely full screen so epic is definitely smaller and a little squished horizontally , taller vertically , but the color is far more vibrant on the epic , although sometimes a little too blue  .
interface on evo had better touch response  .
epic keyboard is very good and i do not think the phone is too bulky (also weighs a little less than evo)  .
i researched both ahead of time and found some professional reviews very impartial and spot on with pros and cons  .
i found quite a few reviewers had not used the units and were already competitive with one being junk , the other great , etc  .
that does not help anyone  .
both phones are very cool  .
that said , my son has a moment that just very recently received 2  .
my daughter has the intercept that came out in july , still at 2  .
1 and has interface issues  .
both enjoy the keyboards  .
i had their flagship large screen instinct and it is sharp but also had interface issues and is sorely lacking in updates  .
no question that the epic is a beautiful phone but if it could be rooted (someone will do it) so we could get around the sammy interface and be able to update the system to 2  .
2 and whatever is next via android i would feel more confident  .
i went with the evo but , again , both are cool phones and this is not about competition  .
pick the one that works for you and based upon your needs .
walk into any phone store and the boys there will tell you that phones are getting bigger not smaller  .
they are wrong  .
7 is the magical size  .
0 inch would work , but samsung managed to screw this up by making the phone super duper tall  .
this thing is taller than an evo  .
that is crazy  .
i have small hands  .
i can hold a captivate and vibrant in my right hand just find  .
but add the keyboard thickness and the extra tallness (why is epic taller than a the other galaxy phones  .
) and you get a phone that is just plain too big 3  .
7 inch screens is where it is all , folks  .
if you want to carry a 5inch screen around , go buy dell's new phone  .
but anyone who does that is not about using a phone they want a pc and if you are going to carry around a 4  .
3 or 5 inch phone , you might as well carry around a 10 inch netbook instead  .
i don't want a pc in my pocket  .
i want a phone first but a phone that can do a few basic pc things  .
i want to surf the web with a decent browser  .
android gives me that  .
but i do not need a phone that is too big to fit in my front pocket or too big to sit down with it in that pocket  .
samsung almost got it right on the size compromise here , but then they blew it by making it too tall  .
why did they make it extra tall  .
because they wanted to add a smiley key and other useless keys on the qwerty keyboard  .
they compromised on the wrong things and placement of the power/wake button is better than on the evo , but it is still stupid  .
it needed to by above the keyboard piece  .
instead they but that button on the bottom piece (on the keyboard piece)  .
dumb  .
it is much harder to reach there in a natural fashion 512mb of on board memory for programs and data storage  .
plain dumb  .
should be 1 gig minimum and should really be 8 gig on board total  .
i care less about the micro card than i do about the onboard memory size  .
so why did samsung go all cheap here  .
other phones have as much as 8 gb the phone lags sometimes  .
especially on the heptic keys  .
i know that the nice look of all one piece of glass is intended  .
but , there are many good ways to include real keys and still make the phone look great  .
this heptic key business is dumb  .
android phone makers take heed   start using real keys on the phones' front  .
people prefer real keys any day of the week touchwiz is fine  .
if you are used to htc , then you will be annoyed by it  .
if you when from samsung to htc , you would hate htc's interface slider for the micro    usb is very smart  .
keyboard is ok  .
not horrible and nothing to brag about but better than most  .
it feels cheap , though  .
i can alone assume that samsung used cheaper/lighter parts to save weight oh , and all those jokers out there who complain about the epic only have 1 led compared to the 2 that htc offers   have you ever really looked at the led's on the htc phones  .
they are smaller and less powerful  .
the single led on the epic is much more powerful and brighter than a single led on any htc phone  .
go learn something about leds and you will learn that quantity means nothing whatsover .
aimed for iphone 3g/3gs form factor  .
screen text sizes not a mach for evo  .
had it for 1    hour before returning it for our 3rd evo .
this phone is a total fail on behalf of samsung  .
it's expensive for what you get  .
it has less features than the htc evo 4g  .
i own a htc evo and i is personally expecting something epic from this phone , not old technology .
background   i got about 45 minutes with this phone with a bud who is the appointed early adopter at the sprint store  .
without rehashing the reviews , i will just comment on what hasn't been said by most of the reviews because they are just quick hands on type reviews the first point is there is are quite a number of applications and utilities missing from epic compared other galaxy's series phones (captivate and vibrant)  .
i agree with the consensus that the htc gui is a much nicer implementation of android than galaxy , but even if we are neutral on that , i cannot for the life of me understand why key applications on the other galaxy phones are missing on the sprint version  .
perhaps sprint wants to pitch pay services , or samsung wished to balance the non g galaxy phones by hobbling the sprint version on other features , or perhaps 4g takes overhead on the 512 given the 2  .
1 (no froyo on this for months) doesn't use the memory card for apps , but this is a shame  .
for example you cannot swap out contacts or messaging to browser or gmail , a very nifty and useful utility on captivate missing on epic  .
also missing is the music player  .
mobileburn found about a dozen missing applications and features comparing epic to captivate , and those i checked on epic were in fact missing  .
why  .
secondly the gps on the epic is not up to par with other smart    phones  .
acquisition and re    acquisition is slow , and the fixes are not precise  .
we tried with a number of gps applications and epic did worse than the other handsets inside and outside  .
yes , samsung says they are working on this , but samsung has a long reputation of not paying attention to post sale updating and fixes i do not want my review to seem pessimistic or negative  .
the good points mentioned by other reviewers are all there   killer display , monster data speed , etc , i only wanted to comment in detail on some unexpected problems that may be more important to some potential buyers  .
this is especially important given there are no return or exchange alternatives , as the only alternative 4g , evo , is on more or less long term back    order .
so after a year of having my htc hero , i felt the need to upgrade to the latest and greatest phone in sprint's line up the samsung epic 4g , right  .
wrong  .
yes , the screen is amazing , the camera takes great pictures , the swipe texting is something i really miss , but there were just far too many cons that outweighed the pros on this phone  .
first and foremost is cell reception  .
i have never owned a phone before that got as inconsistent a cell signal as this thing  .
whereas my htc hero would get 5 out of 6 bars at my house , i would get 1    2 bars on the epic  .
if i is anywhere away from a line of sight of a cell tower , you might as well forget about making phone calls , texts , etc  .
i explained this problem to sprint , did a hard reset and continued to have problems with this  .
the roaming setting is horrible as well  .
at a place where my hero would enter roaming , it would lock on to that , and stay in roaming  .
the epic  .
all i got is a pretty blue circle with a line going through it , meaning sorry buddy , i'm out of service oh , and if i only had one bar of service , it wouldn't allow me to send texts , phone calls etc  .
i had to have 2 bars or above for this , and one bar or no service is an every day occurance for me  .
even on my hero , if i have one bar , i can still send texts , make phone calls just fine  .
this is a huge issue on this phone , at least for me , and i have a feeling samsung has no plans on fixing this the gps isssue that many people are having is seen on my device as well  .
sometimes it would work , other times it would not , but when it did work , it is shotty  .
i'd be driving down a main highway , with a clear line of sight to the sky , and it would show me driving through a field 100 or so yards away  .
if you need to rely on this device to get you around , i suggest a different phone i also had issues with the notification light  .
one thing i have to have on any phone is a notification light for texts etc , as i like to keep my phone on my desk at work , and see when i have a new text etc , without the phone beeping or vibrating  .
well the epic does this ok , but it will only blink 6 times , and will not blink again until you press a button etc  .
i dont see why the light couldnt just continue to blink  .
its just an led , cannot be using that much battery  .
it's a small issue , but an annoyance the slider part of this phone is one issue i is worrying about as well  .
i've never had a slider phone before , and is worried about how this would hold up over the course of a year at least  .
well , luckily i returned the phone after 29 days , but after that much use , with occasional texting on the physical keyboard (used swype the majority of the time and i miss it    ( ) the slider mechanism is starting to feel a little sloppy the micro usb port is also a very poorly designed feature in my mind  .
number one   why the hell would you put the charging port on top of the phone  .
i've had many times when trying to talk on this thing while it is charging , and the cable simple falls out  .
number two   the connection should have been something more snug  .
the mini usb works great on my hero , and i dont see why manufacturers are moving away from that to the micro usb  .
i cannot tell you how many times the charger has simply fell out from moving the phone around a bit but after all of my complaints , i will say    .
the screen is amazing  .
the physical keyboard is nice (disregarding the slider issue)  .
the camera takes decent pics and videos  .
it has a flash and notification light  .
battery does all right for the size and power of this phone  .
swype is great  .
but all of these features are useless with out service  .
for the time being , i'll just hold onto my hero and my upgrade until something more reliable comes out  .
there are some serious flaws with the epic , and i'm not relying on samsung or sprint to fix this phone at all  .
had the same issue with the instinct , and they promised updates , fixes etc , and nothing ever came  .
seriously considering verizon .
the other 4g phone , the evo , gets anywhere up to 1mbit+/sec upload on the 3g network , and i have even seen 2    3 year old blackberrys get around 800 kbits/sec (depending on time of day and location , all on the same network/tower and testing simultaneously alongside the epic) , but the epic consistantly is limited to only 150 kbits/sec  .
have tested this 2 ways , stopwatch/calculator (low tech way , usually calculate around 100 kbits/sec on epic , about 750    800 kbits/sec on the evo) and with the speedtest  .
net site / android app  .
if you plan on using this phone to take video/pictures and upload them directly to the internet , the upload speed will really kill ya here , not even to mention potential video chatting with others using the included qik software .
i can handle the battery life since i purchased a 2    in    1 charger even though i despise micro usb since they are extremely fragile and useless if the plug inside the phone snaps  .
what i hate about this phone is the lack of email push  .
you constantly have to manually get the mail and sometimes that only works once  .
however , if you restart the device , then the push will happen once  .
i have multiple emails and this is an extreme nuisance  .
the samsung instinct is above and beyond its' email app than this poor excuse  .
i've tried other email apps with this phone and they all have the same issue the google android seems overhyped especially if you have to constantly close apps that you don't even open  .
thank god for atk  .
the apps i use for the most part are fine but when using bluetooth in your car and you use gps or try voicemail on speakerphone , the latter two don't work  .
you have to disable bluetooth in order for the device's speakerphone to work finally , i paid an extra $50 for this and the damn thing did not even come with a slip case  .
i expected one for the price  .
i regret getting this even though i researched it  .
i liked the evo , but it's just too big to fit in a pocket i'm also afraid to install froyo 2  .
2 with all the horror stories that google/sprint/samsung may not do should the update fails  .
good luck to those who are in the market for a phone  .
there will always be pros and cons  .
i just wished i had more pros than cons with this phone .
coming from an owner of smartphones since the palm treo 300 in 2002   since then i have had a treo 600 , 700 , htc touch , samsung instinct , ppc 6800 , treo 800 and a palm pre  .
this phone has the worst battery life of any phone i have every experienced out of the box , even the samsung instinct  .
anyone who says they get a full days use out of this phone is out of it  .
on a 20 minute drive through 3g covered networks with wifi , gps , 4g disabled , this thing will go from 100% to 70%  .
insane  .
yes  .
and before you ask , i tried  .
juice defender  .
and  .
advanced task killer  .
yes i updated this and that and used  .
airplane mode  .
often  .
this thing just sucks battery quickly  .
the main concern is that off the charger you would only get a few hours on standby  .
in an emergency this thing could leave you in a pickle this phone has amazing potential with its breathtaking screen , its luscious pictures and video , and its lightning fast response to touch and switching tasks  .
there are so many cool apps for the phone  .
the gps worked great  .
the keyboard is a bit large and not so ergonomic for medium to large hands  .
hardware buttons help somewhat default email for yahoo and ymail  .
not so great at all coming from a palm pre user , this phone takes seemingly many more movements to do the same things i do on a pre in one or two movements  .
it gets cumbersome and time consuming now think about this  .
you already paid at least $250 for the phone  .
and there is at least $70 or more for the plan (most of us cannot even get 4g for that extra $10  .
it comes with no case  .
it comes with no protective screen shield  .
now you want me to buy another battery and wall charger because this thing sucks battery life too  .
nope returned .
i had my update and spent time doing research ont the epic vs evo  .
what swayed me to the epic is the qwerty keyboard  .
funny thing is , once i found out about swype and talk    to    text , i rarely flip my keyboard out to use it  .
also , when playing around with both phones at sprint store before purchase , i noticed that the epics youtube videos were far inferior to the evo , and i thought i could deal with it , but i cant  .
however , the biggest deal breaker for me right now is the sms and mms issue  .
it seems like after having my phone on for a while , whenever i send texts or pictures to my contacts , i will get a clock next to the message , even when i have 3g signal , and my texts wont send  .
i google searched this and other people were having the same issue  .
lucky for me sprint has a 30 day satisfaction guarentee , so i will return my epic tomorrrow for the evo (it can have swype downloaded , already had android 2  .
2 , and has bugs worked out now vs later) when the sprint reps at store told me to do the battery reset to fix my text issue , i shouldve switched the phone then  .
oh , one last thing , my widgets wont update like they should (clock widget is 7 minutes off , facebook widget was not updating (yes i checked my settings for both) so i will get the evo .
it's not a smooth as the iphone but it's definately better than the evo , battery life is just ok  .
4g is awesome with hotspot and turn    by    turn directions updated  .
on sep 22 , 2010  .
nice android phone but it should have the latest version of the os  .
excellent graphics  .
camera is good .
this is my 6th smartphone , 1st android  .
i love android , it's a great phone o/s  .
but i want to focus on just the device so i won't mention android too much  .
i had huge expectations for this phone , so much that my wife and i both got one  .
we got it on opening day with our invitation tickets as if they were going to sell out  .
(i love marketing ploys) phone works great most of the time  .
it's really snappy and fast at times but other times it can be sluggish and unresponsive  .
overall , it works fine though , besides one crucial flaw    .
on the bottom of the phone  .
there is a cloaking back arrow touch button that almost always requires 2    3 presses to register  .
i've already swapped out one phone at the sprint store  .
my new one worked great for 2 weeks , now i have the same problem again  .
my wife too has this same issue  .
sprint has had us both hard reset our phones to fix it  .
still waiting for a solution  .
this is a big deal as i am relying that the back button works one time  .
when it does not and requires multiple presses    it really screws up my thought process  .
each time pressing back 2    3 times gets old fast  .
sprint tech support is still looking into this issue  .
just google samsung epic back button problem you'll find lots of people talking about this issue other thoughts about the epic    .
phone quality is good , however speaker phone has a tin or echo sound at times , also caller on other side notices the mic degradation while on speaker phone camera takes good pictures with correct lighting  .
led flash almost always over exposes the picture  .
not recommended for low light situations keyboard is quite nice , i love it a lot  .
power button is on right side toward the top , this has been hard to get used to  .
battery life is not all that great ,    buy additional chargers , and maybe buy the app juice defender  .
(it works) no bluetooth dial out feature  .
bluetooth will only work with incoming calls so it's not really roadwarrior friendly overall , it's a nice phone  .
the screen is gorgeous , but it's been hard to focus and enjoy the screen with the back button issue  .
i hope it's just a software glitch  .
2nd new phone just started doing it (worked fine for 2 weeks) , so it's really unpredictable  .
in conclusion   i would highly recommend the phone only if bottom touch back arrow button gets fixed updated  .
on sep 18 , 2010  .
i do not have anything to add to all the good reviews of the features of the phone , they are spot on  .
but gps is a mess  .
i is worried about gps so i did some testing over at my local sprint store with the person there who gets assigned a phone early  .
the epic for a fact has the same two different gps problems as the other galaxy phones , nothing has been fixed  .
it is essentially useless for accurate gps  .
you can go into the settings and get teh approximate location working but you cannot get the epic to constantly performed with real agps  .
it is not getting position form satellites , but only a poor estimate from sprint  .
we checked through a couple of device resets , and giving it time in case the problem is just a a startup problem  .
it is more than that  .
samsung says it is testing some fixes , but that begs the question of why this phone is now being sold if the fixes will be easy , given they have been known for months in the other galaxy models updated  .
on sep 20 , 2010  .
i love the phone in general  .
the battery technology has not caught up with the phone technology  .
i turned off all applications that could drain the battery , which are the ones that make this phone so great , and i still got only about 6 hours of idle time with the phone  .
by idle time i mean , the phone is on the counter , not being used and the battery drained  .
i am very disappointed in the battery life  .
i called samsung and they suggested i take a charger with me everywhere i go  .
i do not want a corded phone  .
do not throw your money away unless you have it to throw away , because you will need to buy an extra battery , car charger and an extra wall charger .
i didn't mind paying the price for what is advertised  .
however i have found that the epic is not what it is hyped up to be  .
for starters , the web browser is very slow  .
though i am in one of the 'lucky' markets that allegedly has 4g service , i have found about two places in my entire city where i actually have legitimate service (i  .
e service where the line doesn't cut in and out regularly)  .
ultimately , the 4g is for all intents and purposes worthless in my area (philadelphia)  .
another reason for buying the phone is to utilize the gps  .
well , the gps is soooo slow that i can literally drive 1/2 way to my destination before the gps can even figure out directions  .
if you are buying this for the gps service , do no waste your time  .
last but not least , do not intend to buy this phone unless you are content to have constantly plugged into your charger  .
the battery loses its charge extremely fast (in approx an hour if you intend to use video or gps) the phone service is non    exisant in most of my house , but i do not blame that on sprint as i had the same exact problem with t    mobil let me see , i would say that the mpe3 player is a nice utility  .
summarily , the phone is not completely worthless , but i'm bringing this one back before the 30 days of my contract is up  .
updated  .
on sep 26 , 2010  .
the device is good but it has warts that just continue to nag at you  .
it is is a device that wants to be used but the more you use it the more it feels like a version 0  .
the voice quality is bad , it does sound tinny and the speaker phone is hallow  .
a cheap flip phone from 5 years ago sounds better  .
a headset does improve this  .
the screen is nice but the keyboard , though it looks good , simply is poorly designed from block fonts on the keys o and d look identical to secondary characters that clutter the look of the device  .
keys are too big and run into one another  .
for this device bigger is not better it feels like a cheap knock off with an overall low quality feel of the slider mechanism and a truly misreable vga front facing camera the specifications and features look good but the implementation leaves me wondering what it could be in the second go round  .
you find silly design issues even with the multi    media dock that when you place the device in it the volume keys are covered plus the audio out is not functional on the deck pending an android 2  .
2 update the positive is that the device has a 30 day return policy thank you sprint i will wait for the epic x before i settle for this overweight and bloated device  .
the bloat is not only in the size of it but in the software on it why oh why cannot i remove the game that i will never play but sprint and samsung insist i have  .
the screen is big and bright and the device has potential  .
i could not live with on a daily basis so i want to take a good look at an evo before i try to make a love    hate relationship work with the epic updated  .
on sep 20 , 2010  .
would not recommend this phone till all the bugs are worked out  .
email is a big issue if it does not work consistently .
first off , great phone for operating speed  .
the gpu is about 3 times more powerful than the htc evo or apple iphone 4  .
i had my heart set on the samsung epic despite the shoddy support samsung provides for software updates  .
(i have an eternity , not exactly a great phone if you've actually owned one)  .
once i got to the sprint store i is surprised at how flimsy the whole phone felt , due mainly to the slide out keyboard  .
it is loose to the point that i'm afraid it would constantly slide open and closed in my pocket and be more prone to break if bumped while open  .
the keyboard keys were flat and even while looking at the keyboard my fingers would get lost and hit the wrong keys or multiple keys at the same time  .
with the swipe app for android phone i wouldn't ever want to use the keyboard  .
the keyboard is like having a side    car attached to a motorcycle  .
if someone is inside i can see how it's useful , but in this case the side    car feels like it's about to fall apart  .
even cnet editors have touched on some keyboard issues , but it's a shame that they do not put more importance on form and function as they do features  .
i use this phone for work  .
i is a previous blackberry user and this phone is not even in the same league when it comes to email  .
it doesn't refresh emails or sync like a blackberry and is a pain to set up a work email address (non google)  .
there would be hour delays before i got any of my emails there is no built in spell check for the pull out keyboard  .
how can that be on a $300 plus phone  .
i had terrible service indoors , even if i is by a window android market would only download apps for me after battery pulls the battery life is really poor  .
i understand these new smart phones use a lot of juice but if i leave for work in the morning and come home at night and my phone is almost dead that is not acceptable the issues above are not limited to me , do a google search for epic and any of these issues and you will see i am not the only one i had a real problem getting used to the size of the phone  .
i am not going to wear a belt holster so sticking this thing in my pocket is extremely uncomfortable even though i loved the ease of web browsing and the beautiful screen i need this phone to be dependable for email and i just could not trust it  .
i is in my 30 day window for returns so i returned the phone for a trusty blackberry .
until they workout the bugs i would not buy this phone  .
the service sucks  .
i just don't get it  .
i had to replace my two year old samsung after the slide keyboard finally wore out so i decided to get the epic  .
it sure looked like it would fill my needs from all the marketing hype  .
i had way too difficult a time with the phone afer one week of ownership  .
lots of eye candy for you to see but the expense is the battery  .
battery life is horrible  .
it is dead overnight  .
no really useful standby time and you will wake up to a phone that is dead or waking you up because it is dying  .
always need a charger of some type nearby or be constantly teathered to a power cord which makes it useless on a motorcycle  .
always had to leave it on a charging pad on my desk at work or be worried that the battery would be dead  .
three hours max is best time  .
i even did the complete discharge and recharge three times hoping to improve battery life  .
no such luck  .
recharging takes a very long time in my opinion  .
my last samsung charged in about an hour or less  .
this one takes forever even when powered off  .
i have yet to exceed an eight hour period before needing a recharge  .
charge it overnight , head to work at 8am and it will be dead by 4pm or sooner if i don't leave it on a charger of some type  .
my hands free feature on my previous samsung phone is outstanding and worked well with my sony hbh980 or my nolan ncom helmet  .
this one has a lot to be desired  .
no voice activation calls at all  .
if it is there i sure cannot find it  .
sony hbh 980 headset does show my contact list , type of phone and auto answers but doesn't auto disconnect and resume music like my old samsung phone  .
being a long distance motorcycle rider this is important to me  .
voices sound like you are talking in a tin can and on the bike it really sucks  .
constantly having to check to see if apps are running in the background draining the battery  .
your contact list is an app that has to be turned off if you make a call from it or you end up with a dead battery pretty soon  .
answering the phone is another major pain in the butt  .
you have to slide your finger over the screen to answer to unlock it then slide to answer if you are not on a bluetooth  .
no easy button to answer the calls with  .
you will have several rings go by before you can get the call or it goes to voice mail before you get done trying to answer  .
media is another story  .
i got really annoyed that i always had to slide the keyboard out or punch a button to get to the main screen  .
if the screen timed out then you had to slide open the keyboard or punch the button on the side and then get to your contact list or task  .
too many steps  .
the media hub feature is not working on my phone  .
read that it is not available yet  .
nice  .
i is unable to link it to my pc to load my music or any other media  .
no drivers are yet on samsungs site for this model  .
lots of free apps but found very few out there  .
very hard to find anything cool  .
merging my emails is another nightmare  .
the tv commercial showed the ability to use it with any samsung tv  .
well i wanted to use it like the tv said but is not successful on that either  .
to change the sd card the phone has to go through an undocking before you remove the card  .
cannot just switch cards or you damage the phone  .
it will work with a 32 unlike my other phone  .
sprint does offer several levels of service starting at $69 which is far cheaper than any other service provider but to use 4g you add another ten bucks and 4g is only available in major markets  .
add another $30 if you want to use it as a hotspot or tethering to a wireless device which they do not say that on the commercials  .
this still makes it cheaper than the competitors though  .
i am sure there is an app out there that will defeat that fee if you can find it but again you will be paying another fee for it  .
this is a $500+ phone and not everybody can afford to replace it if they drop and crack the screen so add more monthly fees for insurance  .
i am sure it will be a hot item for thieves too so insurance will be a must have  .
i have spent hours toying with it as well as reading and rereading the manual  .
just not the phone for me  .
could be my less than tech saviness but thankful for sprint having a thirty day return policy so i can find one at the sprint corporate store that works for me .
btw  please do not post a sub    review regarding the concept of reviewing sprint with the epic 4g    they have a monopoly on this phone  .
its very much related  .
no one i know it the east and west coasts combined has ever said they get any decent signal with sprint  .
this phone is a case study in manufacturers who rush products to market before they are ready  .
the many , many bugs on this phone are well    documented on other sites , but i bought before doing my research  .
first and foremost , the gps does not work  .
i mean not at all  .
some say they can get there's to locate them , but it gives the wrong location  .
so what good is that  .
i cannot get mine to even locate me at all  .
i really , really want to love this phone  .
it has the most amazing display and 4g , but the bugs on this thing make windows vista look reliable .
when they sell you the phone , they forget to mention that there's no voice dialing for blue    tooth hmmm , is not driving w/a cell phone in your hand illegal  .
next , they forget to mention that this nifty pull    out keyboard (which is the big selling feature) doesn't have spell check  .
terrible battery life , emails get boggled , data gets boggled , back button is oftentimes inoperative , it's unreliable and the phone changes its personality throughout the day  .
terrible battery life  .
i feel like a complete fool , and am really annoyed w/sprint that they're selling this garbage  .
oh , to boot , it's not yet updated to 2  .
2 and there's no eta  .
do not get sold on this (and we were talked into buying two  .
the most expensive , least reliable phone i've ever had  .
i am so irritated (obvious , eh)  .
an absolutely poor , dysfunctional product that should not be on the market as is  .
epic fail .
this is the second samsung phone i've had , the first one is such a major disappointment i is reluctant to buy this one  .
however since it is android based and its been 4 yrs , i figured i'd try it  .
at first i is pretty impressed at the speed and feel of it  .
compared to my g1 , its crazy fast  .
i justed moved over to sprint from another company so i bought a evo for my daughter and the epic for myself i just have to have a keyboard  .
the evo has android 2  .
2 , which means flash 10  .
1 , faster os vs 2  .
also the evo has a feature to disable mobile veiw android 2  .
2 is released before the epic 4g , i assumed it would have it to out the box  .
it did not , i didn't find out about the mobile veiw issue until a few days after i bought it  .
considering my g1 can load up several sites my brand new epic 4g cannot and no android 2  .
2 with flash 10  .
1 all in all i am very disappointed and i should gotten the evo instead for $50 les  .
one other thing to consider sprint won't let me post this reveiw for some reason , so i would not trust their rating of this phone at their site .
here are some examples of the epic vs  .
the evo when using sprint nav on the epic and a phone call comes in , you are exited from nav and have to go back in and restart your route when the call is finished  .
the evo remains in nav during the duration of the call and simply returns you to the nav page when the call is over , muting the driving directions while on the phone  .
when using bluetooth headset , the epic doesn't hear voice commands from the headset , but the evo works perfectly  .
and it does not matter what model headset you had , because i test 4 different models on both phones  .
i could go on and on with an entire page of complaints , but you should get the idea  .
the epic is a real chore to use , but the evo just worked without having to think about it .
bought it at 9am this morning and returned it at 7pm  .
4g signal only when outdoors  .
only 3g indoors  .
seems to be a long connection outage whenever switching from 4g    3g or vice versa  .
dropped calls 3 times driving up and down the freeway from dallas to mckinney  .
hardware is nice but sprint network  .
atleast in dfw is as bad as ever .
