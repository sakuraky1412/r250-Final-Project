for my price point there is no better television  .

bought it on amazon  .

no issues  .

saved about 200 bucks that way and arrived safely and carried in by careful guys  .

not one issue hooking it up  .

color and blacks continue to amaze  .

it's like my own personal movie theater in my house .

i have a smaller (32 ) samsung tv and i expected this larger version to have a slightly worse picture (the small tv has an awesome picture) but i is pleasantly surprised  .

the new one is far superior in all modes  .

even the pc input is terrific  .

i suppose there are pictures as good or better but i do not thin my eye would be able to detect it  .

this set is also a good by  .

i bought it at bestbuy as a close    out  .

i cannot even find it anymore on their website and i have only had it 2 weeks  .

if you can find this set for less than $1800 , buy it  .

i use this with a directv hd hr23 stb and a logitech harmony one universal remote and they work flawlessly together .

i recommend everyone to get this hdtv for its quailty and popularity .

is forced to buy a new tv after my my four year    old sony's light engine died for the second time and sony would not cover the repair  .

they offered me a discount on one of their lower end models (60hz) and would not budge  .

told them no thanks , i'll spend my money elsewhere  .

reviewed different models extensively on cnet and elsewhere  .

i'm so glad i bought this samsung  .

best tv i have ever owned period  .

colors are rich and blacks are truly black  .

very little adjustment needed right out of the box  .

felt confident about buying this unit and i am glad i did  .

is a little concerned about the remote and the wheel  .

i think it is a personal preference issue more than anything else  .

i found it easy to use , similar to a computer mouse and therefore very comfortable for me to use  .

my wife finds it easier to navigate with the wheel  .

red color not noticeable  .

au revoir , sony  .

you'll never see another dollar of mine .

this is my first hdtv so i really spent a lot of time researching  .

i generally read a lot of positive comments about this set and all of the comments were true  .

the purchase experience is great (buydig) and the set is working within about 3 minutes of arriving  .

fortunately for me , the ncaa's were on when i plugged it in and from the first second i saw the picture i is stunned  .

crystal clear picture with vibrant and true colors that are not overly intense  .

there are 3 predefined settings for picture but the standard picture setting is perfect for me  .

there are a number of other picture controls but quite frankly i haven't had to use any of them  .

the standard definition tv picture is just ok but that's not why i bought an hdtv even things that people complained about in the reviews that i read don't seem that bad  .

of all the negative issues , i is most worried about the glare  .

this has not been a problem  .

our tv is in a room with a large window on the side and while the sun doesn't shine directly on the tv the room does get filled with light and this has just not been a problem  .

the remote control is another issue i read about but since i programmed my fios remote to work the tv , this has not been an issue either  .

i could see what other users were talking about with the remote but this should not be a reason to stay away from this tv  .

finally , i read a lot of negatives , especially from cnet , about the red touch of color but the red is really subtle and actually adds a little character to the set overall , an absolutely amazing picture on a set that is exceptionally easy to set up  .

i is glad i did my research and really happy about choosing this tv  .

i'm going to buy a smaller version of the same tv for our bedroom .

i bought this for $1895 for the superbowl and am loving it  .

i went from an old 27 tube sony (still a great picture) to the ln52a650  .

i did 4 months of research before buying  .

i compared this model to sony , toshiba , vizio , panasonic and pioneer lcds , and to 50 plasmas from the same makers  .

the 650 is the standout in terms of features and picture quality  .

not to mention the design is very nice , swivel stand , and lower power consumption than most other sets in its class  .

i would highly recommend this set , especially now that it's nearly feb  .

2009 and you'll be able to pick it up more cheaply as the year goes on and dealers clear their stock to make room for the newer models  .

this thing is pretty    near future    proof .

highly recommended  .

easy to use  .

location of connections on the back are convenient and numerous  .

the red color mentioned by cnet is hardly noticeable , unless you have a lot of light and really look hard  .

it looks almost black  .

you can not go wrong here  .

it is an awesome piece of furniture .

well worth every penny spent  .

i simply like everything which they have provided  .

has all the latest tech specs  .

also have ethernet port connectivity for latest news , firmware , alerts etc right ont he screen    including weather  .

simply awesome .

i have been researching lcd tv's for quite awhile , finally picked this one  .

my plasma screen started to have a black line going across it  .

so had to buy a new set  .

this thing is amazing the picture makes it look like you are looking out the window and watching them make the movie right in front of you .

l sat and looked at the top of the line sony when l bought this and to be honest l did not see 1 , 000 dollars more tv from sony at that time  .

l am  .

i just bought this tv yesterday and i love it  .

but when i is watching a dvd , the picture looked a little funny , it's hard to explain , but it didn't feel like it is a movie  .

i felt like i is in the tv itself  .

i'm wondering if this is a result of my settings (automotion) and what can i do to turn it off  .

, because i do not want that .

it takes alot for a tv to impress me and the picture on this tv looks like you are iin the movie  .

even regular dvd's look alot better and blu ray movies look incredible  .

you will love it  .

i got mine a circuit city for $1999  .

00 plus tax  .

i bought the 22 version of this tv six months ago for the kitchen  .

it is only 720p , but it had a great picture and worked well with our analog tivo (hooked up via component)  .

i also had a 20 year old antenna in the attic and since we were only 25 miles from chicago , i decided to hook it up and to see what would happen  .

well , it is amazing    we got all the local chicago channels in glorious hd (ota over the air)  .

this convinced me to buy the big brother ln52a650 for the family room  .

i know this spring i will be getting a new antenna mounted on the roof for better reception  .

i also hooked up our ancient xbox (not xbox 360) to the the 52 set via the composite video cable that came with it originally and popped in a dvd (hbo / rome) and again is amazed by the picture quality  .

i had to change the settings on the xbox for widescreen , etc , but i have to say it looks great  .

i have since ordered the xbox component video cable and the optical sound cable  .

i cannot wait to see the quality bump using those cables  .

my plan is to eventually get a sony play station 3 for bluray dvd playback and for better playback with sd dvds  .

i am also looking into htib (home theater in a box) , but my wife hates cables running all over so we'll have to work on that one  .

so far , i like the onkyo st7100 with ipod dock so far , i'm completely satisfied with this purchase  .

a very competitive deal from circuit city , fairly easy to setup (it is harder getting rid of the old stuff) , and it works great with older components  .

cannot wait for the ps3 with bluray and a sound system  .

(i have no connection with samsung , circuit city or onkyo)  .

updated  .

on dec 6 , 2009  .

high definition video on this tv set is fantastic  .

the picture is very clear and sharp  .

has little to no blurring effect from 7ft away  .

the 120hz takes hd movies and gaming to a whole new level of vivid , life    like experience  .

when i first bought this tv set , i connected my playstation 3 via hdmi to it and watched casino royale  .

i must say , i is speechless great investment if you enjoy watching movies and playing games in hd .

well , my 1080p sxrd had the good ole yellow stain issue where the top right of the screen starts get a yellow burn in kind of weird effect going on , so best buy is going to repair it , however after about a month of waiting they determined that the part (the entire optical block) is on backorder indefinitely and offered to replace the tv  .

after looking at the tvs in the store we decided on this one this is a great tv  .

cnet dwells entirely too much on the touch of color in the bezel    our entertainment center is mahogany and the deep red/almost maroon tone of the bezel matches it well  .

when the tv is on and the lights are low you cannot see it at all anyway coming off of an excellent picture on the sxrd i is somewhat concerned that the lcd would not be able to match it , however this one is at least as good if not better than the sxrd's picture , and it doesn't have the off axis issues (esp up and down) that rear projections have  .

standard def looks better for sure gaming performance is excellent for those who care    no motion blur  .

takes some extra tweaking to get the picture just right due to the somewhat unique color palettes in games , but once it's set it looks amazing cannot comment on the speakers    first setting change i made is to disable them as i have a home theater set up already the remote is really bad  .

fortunately , i have a harmony remote so i don't have to deal with the one that came with the tv very often  .

the click wheel like thing is just bad news , and the really ironic part is that you don't even need it for any of the functions , just pressing the wheel will move through the menus , and faster too  .

my suggestion    get a harmony or something like it  .

everyone who tries to use your home theater (wife , guests , etc) will thank you some of the extras are interesting    network enabled , usb port for flash drives to play music/show slideshows  .

the other nice thing is the flash drive can be used to update the firmware (the operating system of the tv) so samsung can make improvements to the software of the tv over time to fix bugs (since an hdtv is essentially a very specific purpose computer) and to enhance features all in all , i highly recommend this tv  .

the picture quality is amazing , the price point is pretty good , and you wo not be disappointed .

worth every cent  .

i will definiely purchase from a href   http  //www  .

amazon  .

com/dp/b001413df8/  .

tag  cnet    ee    20 amazon  .

com /a again .

anyone out there know what i can do to resolve the issue  .

is it tv or the hdmi cable  .

when i switch to component cable , it's working fine .

have had for two weeks no issues , works great  .

awsome picture i seen the new sams with back lighting and just cant see spending the extra on it  .

this set is better then any sony on the market as of 9    31    08  .

this set looks better home then at cc which i got a pretty good deal  .

if theres better it would be hard pressed to see the difference  .

hd    dvd seems to have better 3    d effect then my new s350 blue    ray which is not a bad thing cause transformers on hd    dvd gives me and my friends motion sicknes to ware i have to dial down settings  .

all i can say is awsome tv  .

is waiting for the new sony to come out but got impatient  .

well im not diappointed and truly amazed all people who see are impressed  .

buy it  .

i did my research before buying this tv  .

after comparing prices and options of many large lcd tvs , i chose this one  .

this is my second large hd lcd tv , and it completely blows away the olevia i used to own (which is also about 1/3 of the price though)  .

when i watch blu    ray movies or play ps3 , everything is 3d and the color contrast will keep you on the edge of your seat  .

it is like having the actors in your living room  .

i is angry when i broke the screen on my old olevia , but now i see it as a good thing , as it is incomparable to this samsung  .

i went price shopping online and found that all the good deals were from somewhat shady online distributors that had very bad reviews on resellerratings  .

com and scam report websites  .

i ended up realizing that circuit city is just as competitive as the real distributors so i went there  .

i got lucky because i is ready to pay the $2400 and when i got there they had a promotion where you get a new top of the line samsung blu    ray player with it (msrp    $400 , but it sells for around $250 on ebay)  .

i am going to sell the blu    ray player on ebay and make it so that i pay what the shady distributors were offering  .

the difference is that i got it somewhere that i can walk into the store to   if i need to       ) after dealing with low    cost online distributors before , i know this ability to go to the store if i have a problem is worth it's weight in gold anyway    awesome set , i've never seen a movie look this good  .

my tv looks better than any movie theater , so i'm not going back to one of those over    priced sh t    holes  .

everybody wants to watch football at my place this fall , so it looks like i can drink as much beer as i want without having to drive       )  .

this lcd is just perfect for any use , be it computer screen , watching sports , movies , and hd gaming  .

i like the red border , it makes the tv look good even when it's off  .

many people complain about the click wheel remote and its tiny sound from the internal speakers  .

however , with this kind of tv , one should have a home theater set up with proper speakers and a receiver , in addition to a universal remote (harmony) to control all the components  .

the purpose of a tv is to present a beautiful picture , which this set does very well .

for the money , you will not find a feature set even close to this price  .

the tv has one of the best contrast ratios and a vast array of settings to ensure the picture is exactly to your specs  .

if you are looking into buying a 52 set , you will not go wrong with this tv .

my best friend just bought this tv and i helped his set it up i is blown away with the picture  .

the setup is easy and my friend had already downloaded the firmware update that fixes the reset problem  .

easy install using a usb drive i just ordered myself one from amazon    $2199 with a $200 mail    in rebate and free shipping  .

this base price is $200 cheaper than stores i looked at and the free shipping and no taxes is the clincher  .

i will submit an update as soon as i get mine hooked up  .

make sure to update the firmware once you get this to fix the auto shutoff glitch , and make sure you can find a place out of direct sunlight so there wo not be any reflection , although it is not a very big issue  .

the picture , especially in dim or no lighting puts sony to shame  .

also the clickwheel remote does feel a bit cheap , but you can just use it as a directional pad and avoid the frustration that everyone talks about  .

you have the option of switching between 60hz or 120 , and the auto motion plus is really something , it makes shows like the office and scrubs look like they are being filmed live , and hd movies like you are on the set  .

no regrets whatsoever .

it's a very good tv really nice picture quality and colors its almost a sony but the speakers are not that great .

the way the tv powers up lets you know you brought a damn good tv  .

i debated on sony bravia and this and i perfer the picture quality and features on this samsung .

i've been doing research on lcd's and plasma's for past few months and almost purchased the lnt4681  .

but after reading the reviews on the 4681 , i had decided to wait for something with less problems  .

i kept checking cnet and when i saw the review on a650 i went to bestbuy to check it out  .

i fell in love with the tv as soon as i saw it and knew this is the one i is buying i had a chance to compare it with the xbr5 and i liked the picture quality of the 650 better  .

as far as looks , the 650 looked way better then the xbr5  .

i was not too crazy about the red at first but it looked much nicer in person then i expected i is also looking at the a750 but i didn't think the price difference is worth it for a better sound system , 1 gb drive and the wireless function  .

i didn't like the look of the 750 as much as the 650 either  .

i is looking to get a home theater system anyway so i didn't care for the sound system at all and i'm sure its the same for most people  .

a lcd of this rank is incomplete without a home theater system both 650 and 750 are the same in terms of picture quality  .

i watched 300 in bluray and i couldn't believe how great the picture quality was  .

i recently started playing metal gear solid 4 and i have to say it looks amazing especially in game mode so , for all of you in the market for lcds and plasmas , go take a look at the lna650 if you get a chance and that might end your search  .

this tv is currently ranked #1 for cnet best selling products (6/19/2008) just a friendly advice for all potential buyers stay away from all the online retailers if possible  .

get it from bestbuy , circuit city or other major retailers where you can walk in , get the tv and get out  .

and if there's something wrong , it's easier to return or exchange the product  .

online retaliers might be cheaper but it's not worth the hassel  .

if they send the wrong or defective product have fun shipping it back  .

most online retaliers have bad customer service and reviews as well  .

check out epinion  .

com if you do not believe me  .

hope this helps with your decision and purchase .

when my rear projection dlp went south i decided looking for a samsung lcd since i've been seeing such great reviews on them  .

i researched them on here and came upon this model and compared it with some other samsung models such as samsung pn50a550  .

i compared the two and bestbuy before i bought it and wow so worth the extra money 120hz is the feature that amazed me the most  .

watching a blueray on this tv is simply breathtaking so clear it does not seem like reality  .

hopefully when you are searching for a expensive lcd or plasma you do your research and invest the extra bucs it will be worth it in the long run  .

this is great tv ever  .

the design is great and the quality resolution is great too  .

so easy to use  .

it is totally worth of the price  .

our whole family and friends love it .

dont hesitate to buy this one , it wont last long .

if someone want's to be a blessing to me please call reggie  .

314    482    4086  .

owned for a year now and would buy another one .

this tv is awesome  .

friends of mine that have plasmas are jealous  .

i never had any issues with audio or on/off problems  .

i bought it in feb 09  .

you definetly fall in love with this tv every time you sit down  .

gotta say though , if you are watching regular digital cable , it is pretty blurry  .

maybe there is a fix i havent found yet  .

i took a picture of myself in front of it with a screen filled with mountains  .

i show my friends the pic , and they ask me when i went to lake louise  .

great tv  .

i'm literally amazed that after owning this tv for more than a year (we purchased it in june , 2008) and accepting many invites from family friends to come see my new hdtv  .

, that we still haven't seen one yet whose picture can compare to ours  .

we've even stopped going to the movie theater when we found that a blu    ray disc movie on this hdtv is better than the movie screen  .

the new samsung models and other newer models may now be better than this tv , but i've been so satisfied with the ln52a650 , i haven't even bothered to look  .

i know i probably sound like a pitchman for samsung , but i did a lot of research before i bought this tv (originally i thought i wanted a sony) and it's just great that this has turned out to be the best electronic purchase i have ever made , to date  .

no problems , repairs , or glitches  .

i did not rate with a full 5 stars because i cannot speak to the techie parts that i may not know enough to care about or notice (  .

first impressions  .

touch of color is right       and it's just a touch  .

seriously , get over it , with our model (mf'd feb'09) , the red color is so subtle as not be an issue in the least  .

we've wall    mounted it , and discovered 52 is simply , in a word huge  .

52 is perfect for sweeping epics but single    camera tv comedies are frankly difficult to watch  .

we have not used the smaller picture sizes because it just seems wrong somehow hook up and usabililty were simple and fast  .

we use tivo , which apparently strips the time code from the regular cable input , so we set the clock manually ; that's fine wiselink  .

wiselink is nice , but of limited use save for slide shows  .

there are no transition controls , so it's pretty basic  .

mind you basic on a 52 lcdhdtv is pretty amazing info    link   yawn you are not buying/considering this tv for the info    link option  .

position of other elements (newsfeed , stock market info) is only semi    adjustable  .

weather   you get today's (a weather graphic with a high temp) or 5    day forecast that does not include today's weather  .

5    day forecast must be at bottom right of screen , which obscures many graphics and information provided by broadcasters  .

newsfeed is as advertised , and cannot be customized to handle your favorite rss feeds  .

stocks are better , and include major market indicators and the ability to customize your favorites , either nyse or nasdaq remote  .

the much    maligned backlit remote is not so bad ; we do not experience the lag cnet reviewers did  .

the clickwheel's response is fast enough not to be annoying and in the absence of any page down button , is often much    needed , but no substitute for page    down  .

the remote is also larger than needed , and vaguely musket    shaped , which would be nice if one actually were repelling pirates trying to board your tv , but otherwise is merely ok  .

would still prefer remote from showroom floor , w/out scroll wheel for its size and ease of use video quality  .

dvds were viewed running off a first    version xbox with dvd accessory , using composite av cables only picture quality is stellar , and is as good or better than any other brand we researched  .

dark detail is excellent , even with motion (test movies were the dark knight and iron man ) , with no artifacts , dropouts or blurry shadows  .

freeze    frames were sharp , but showed some fringing ; even small text is easily readable in every test some reviewers have had issue with edge flash where the picture distractingly illuminates the edges of the plastic panel under dark conditions  .

this model has a slightly beveled edges , no such distraction is noticed conclusion  .

you will be very pleased with this product overall ; we cannot say enough good things about it , and will be recommending samsung products to any who ask .

great picture  .

money well spent  .

this is one great tv  .

i have had it for over two months now and it is on for approximately 13 hours a day and have not had one issue with it (of course i did purchase the warranty)  .

the picture paired with my ps3 is stellar and dish network hd is also great , probably the best it can be considering the compression charley puts on his channels  .

the speakers are not that great but i do not use them anyway so its of no concern to me , but the only problem i do have with this wonderful tv  .

is the amount of dust the glossy black housing shows , you have to dust it everyday to keep it looking clean  .

other than that i must say if you are looking for one of the best tv's out there look no further you found it .

i like this product mostly because of the hd picture quality  .

also once i turned on my playstation 3 the tv sharpness is beyond what i expected  .

i like the fact that it has pc capability and wiselink , is something extra that really sold me on purchasing this item  .

there are just so many good qualities  .

i would highly recommend this to anyone in the market for a television .

ive purshased that tv and received it today , after that the delivery guy just put the tv in my basement , he took off the the tv from its packaging to see if there is any kind of damage on it  .

then , everything is perfect  .

so i hooked it up on my tv stand (whalen)  .

the picture needed a little bit of settings but after it is simply great  .

i is first scared to get the on/off random issue , but for the moment , nothing seems to be wrong with this tv  .

the playstation 3 blu    ray quality is so imbelievable that i is stunned by the picture quality and fluidity  .

the game are much better in a screen of this size overall , i am verry satisfied by my purshase , i got the 52 inch model , and everything os okay by the way , i got the 2009  .

01 firmware on it , maybe thats why it works , who nowss .

in my search for lcd hdtv it came down to the samsung ln52a650 and the sony bravia kdl    52xbr6  .

the picture on the sony hd mode is not as sharp as the samsung hd mode the colors is little more vibrant  .

both tv's have about the same amount of input video formats  .

the samsung had the better black level for the price  .

the samsung had a elegant and slick look in comparison to the sony  .

although the sony is a good lcd tv , the samsung is price better for the same value as the sony .

i've owned this product for about 6 months now  .

i've had no complaints at all  .

it's especially good with sports like the super bowl , baseball , and basketball  .

the picture is crystal clear  .

i'm currently using 3 hdmi hookups   cable , blue ray , and roku  .

they all perform well  .

no complaints .

i bought this tv because of the review given by david katzmaier and the cnet team  .

my toshiba dlp would not turn on so i told the wife it is broken and bingo new tv  .

i can not really say anything more that has not been said already  .

even my wife (a hater of tv who would be happy with a 27 inch tube tv) said she likes it the 120hz cleans up the sd video with a few jitters on some movies but only on cable do i see this  .

i cannot understand why the cnet clibration had the 120hz turned off in the settings but i am sure it is to preserve the film quality of blue    ray movies  .

with hd and sd video however , i feel it should be set to medium or low the wise link is useless unless you get the next level up to stream netflix  .

i have an xbox 360 which can stream the video so nothing lost there  .

the weather and news streams could be cool but i dont watch movies while getting ready in the mornings so it will never be used pip is a real problem in general for me  .

i cannot understand the manufacturers inablility to allow hdmi or even any hd source to go to pip so my anger is directed to them  .

i want to play my xbox or playstation while watching a game in a pip screen  .

overall this is by far the best lcd tv for the money and i would recommend this 52 inch or the 46 inch to anyone buying a lcd today .

i is excited to see this tv after it recieved an editor's choice , but i is also concerned that the color would be a deal breaker  .

it is honestly so subtle that i hardly notice it  .

the quality of the picture is stunning  .

it has 4 hdmi ports and a fiber optic audio output as well as component video (2) and an ethernet connection  .

all in all , i'm very impressed with the tv and the color of the set is actually very nice  .

i've only had this model for a couple of days , but i cannot seem to stop staring at it  .

i purchased this model to replace my 3 year old samsung 40 lcd , which i is extremely satisfied with (it's now in the bedroom)  .

i'm only using component video cables to connect my hdtv cable box , but the picture has blown me away          i can only imagine what the picture would look like with 120 hz hdmi monster cable  .

i is also glad to find that my set didn't include the wheel remote that others , including the cnet reveiw panel , complained about  .

rather , my remote has four directional buttons  .

my only regret is that i did not purchase this tv months ago  .

this display offers a high picture quality and great feature set at a reasonable price  .

i tracked the price of this item for around 2 months as i had heard the rumor that prices on tvs were to drop before ordering from an online source i wanted to check to see if another store would match the pretax cost so i didn't have to mess with the shipping option since bb (2200) had previously told me that they wouldn't match an internet price i stopped in at hh gregg  .

they had the price listed for 2400 , almost 500 more than the amazon price  .

he asked if he could help me and i just replied we'll see  .

i told the associate that i is buying that tv today , and that he had first crack at selling it to me  .

he knew i is serious , and after he is able to remove the shocked look from his face , i showed him the amazon price since it is the cheapest i could find anywhere (always come into negotiations prepared) and said if he could match or beat it i'd walk out of the store with the tv  .

he walked away for less than a minute and returned to tell me they could do that and we had a deal  .

i purchased the tv for 1900 (2033 after tax) which is a little less than the cheapest i could find online after shipping  .

usually after spending that much money i'll have a little remorse the next day or two , but that definitely hasn't happened  .

every time i turn it on it takes me a few minutes to get over the shock at how amazing the picture actually is i would not hesitate on buying this again for a second  .

i tell everyone to buy this television , 42 , 46 , 52  .

the television is great , picture is next to perfect  .

especially for sports fans this really pops out with the colors on those high def games  .

video games and blu    ray movies run great  .

picture looks just as good from an angle  .

just need samsung to creat a remote that is more functional and response time to your button presses are better  .

lots of hdmi outputs and it includes s    cable , standard video and one added hdmi on the side .

i've only had mine for about a week , but i am just in awe about it  .

i shopped a long time for it , and the reviews i saw on this site had a large impact on my purchase decision  .

i used newegg  .

com for the purchase , and with the free shipping i chose the extended warranty just in case  .

i still paid much less than retail you will not regret your decision .

got mine for $1930 at newegg  .

if this is the size your looking for in an lcd then this is your tv  .

i think you can spend a lot money but a lot better picture does not exist .

i is wowed by this television as soon as i viewed its picture  .

the colors are vivid and the people seem like they're going to walk out of the t  .

v the touch of color is nice when off and hardly noticeable when on  .

you will have plenty of options with this t  .

to control picture and just about anything else  .

the only negative is the sound , not that great for a t  .

of this price range and the odd remote  .

nothing that surround sound and a little practice for each though i guess  .

there is no motion blur which is what i is afraid of with an lcd  .

it is between the samsung and sony and i just thought that the samsung gave me the most bang for my buck  .

i is right .

i looked at a lot of hdtv's and did a lot of research before buying this  .

i had a dlp that is having issues and is so washed out during the day that you could barily see the picture  .

this samsung lcd is a night and day difference  .

i cannot beleive how much better it is , i love this hdtv  .

other than a couple nit    picky complaints it's about as good as they get  .

the only hdtv i'd rather have is a pioneer kuro plasma , but the price difference is too great i could buy two of these for the price of the pioneer kuro you will not be dissapointed , this is an amazing hdtv  .

onecall is selling it for $2084 right now  .

i've been searching for the best performance hdtv for the past 3 months straight editors have to convince me but i have to see them myself at the local stores  .

on an off i would drop by circuitcity , best buy , costco and samsung always have the best picture quality  .

my eyes do not lie and the editors choice pretty much sums it up clearly  .

so yes this tv is a must buy  .

if you gonna get 46 tv , get a plasma  .

the best i see with sattelite super good  .

i will start off by saying wow  .

if you were to put this thing beside some of the highest end pioneer plasmas , i dont think you could tell a difference  .

the glass    like screen gives the picture that plasma/glossy look  .

but dont let the glass screen scare you away with the talk of ambiant light reflection  .

my living room has 2 sky lights and in the day you cant really see any glare except for when it is off  .

the picture is bright enough to compensate for it black levels are amazing with this lcd , even in the day i can see the darkest scenes without a problem  .

and it is awesome in a dark room  .

the other night i watched batman begins on dvd hooked up through component and it is amazing even on a standard player games are great on this tv also  .

i have played a lot of guitar hero , call of duty gears of war , and halo 3 on it via the xbox 360 in 1080p and it looks amazing  .

with the 4ms response time , this tv is almost as fast as my crt pc monitor i used to play on some people say the red trim is too much but it is not that noticable and doesnt look flashy at all in my opinion the factory settings were near perfect in my opinion  .

i have the dvd input set to movie mode just because it cuts the brightness down a little so it doesnt blind me at night the only con i listed is the pip mode  .

it is kinda hard to find and is buried deep in the menues  .

it would have been nicer to have a pip button on the remote like some other lcd's overall i give this thing a 9  .

5 out of 10  .

i plan on getting the samsung bd    p1500 blue    ray player next , then it will really shine .

if you are thinking of switching over to hd , get this tv  .

some tvs are really nice on the outside but have crappy picture  .

but this tv not only has outstanding picture quality , the outside of the tv can be compared to the outside of a ferrari  .

the features that are built into this tv are just about all of what you can dream that a tv can have  .

it has from picture tuning , to looking at the weather forecast  .

the remote is great and is easy to use  .

but the main thing you should know about is the picture quality  .

the picture is so good in fact that when you are watching a baseball game , you will never want to see a baseball game in person again  .

and when you are watching a program on the national geographic channel the picture is so good in fact if you fall asleep and then wake up and see a lion on the tv in front of you , you will %100 mistake for a real animal and just run right out of your house and call animal control  .

anyways , this tv is the rolls royce and farrari of all tvs and when you are ready to get rid of your old tv , replace it with this tv and you will notice the difference like b w and color  .

this is a great buy  .

excellent quality  .

moneys worth  .

love this tv  .

researched lcd's for months  .

do not mind the clickwheel  .

got used to it quick  .

easy hook up and so many hook ups available  .

can hardly see the red color of frame but when i do , like it  .

everyone that comes in loves the picture  .

love the  .

fact that the tv turns  .

i have had no problem with glare  .

easy clean , wipe down with microfiber cloth  .

love it .

i purchased this tv last week  .

although i have only used it for one week , it is a night    and    day difference from my smaller 32  .

lg hdtv i purchased in 2006  .

this tv really lives up to the reviews i found on the net  .

the picture is simply stunning  .

deep blacks    this lcd rivals plasmas for its black levels  .

black levels are extremely important in an hd set , arguably one the most important features in determining its overall picture quality  .

this thing puts out absolutely gorgeous black levels , very deep and  .

inky  .

my old set had very poor black levels , never really going below a dark grey color  .

as soon as i powered this samsung set on , the difference (even right out of the box at factory settings) is drastic  .

the 50 , 000  1 contrast ratio and 4ms response times add to the quality as well  .

cnet called the picture one of the best lcds they have ever reviewed , and i do not disagree  .

amazon  .

s product page on this is also very helpful the 120hz mode works well , if you like the effect  .

personally , i do not like it at all  .

it detracts from the film feel of a movie , and feels fake and processed  .

when watching discovery hd , hd sports or something like that , i could see how you may want to use it , but i prefer watching hd content as delivered i have it paired with both a toshiba hd    dvd player as well as a ps3  .

both pictures are just phenomenal , especially the ps3  .

the 1080p resolution , combined with the 1080p/24 mode the ps3 outputs , is striking (yes , this tv does 1080p/24 , google it to learn more about why 1080p/24 is important) overall , i cannot say that i have found much wrong with this tv  .

during high motion camera pans or intense action i have notices some very minor  .

judder  .

, but nothing that would prevent me from recommending this tv to everyone as other reviewers have stated , this tv does have a red tint around the bezel (dubbed  .

touch of color  .

by samsung)  .

i worried about this initially , as i prefer a single , black color to a bezel  .

don  .

t let it fool you , the red is very subdued in the frame , really just more of a highlight than anything (and only apparent if you are looking for it , or if the light hits it just right)  .

i think it does make the tv look distinguished , and is something i started liking about 5 minutes after i saw it  .

the best way to sum up the color is like a very , very deep red wine in a clear wine glass  .

it looks black for the most part , with just a tinge of red when viewed at the right angle  .

being a wine fan (especially reds  .

) this makes it even more pleasing  .

the sound is standard for an hdtv  .

if you are watching tv , it works just fine  .

not the best sound from a tv , but nothing bad either  .

let  .

s be honest  .

the sound is not why you would buy this set anyways  .

hook it up to a 5  .

1 receiver to match the great picture the price has come down on this model considerably , with the announcement of samsung  .

s new line of hdtvs  .

if you are trying to decide between this model and the a750 , go for this one  .

the 750 has the same specs , with more built in networking potential , recipes , etc  .

personally , i think those are just overkill and not needed anyways  .

this tv does have an ethernet port for getting live information from the internet , though i haven  .

t even tried it out , and may never this set is just a pleasure to watch and you can configure it all day long  .

some sets suffer from being too  .

basic  .

when it comes to customizing the picture (brightness , contrast , color and not much else)  .

not this one  .

you can really tweak it all you want and change the picture to suit your palate  .

i really like the amount of choices you have when being able to adjust the picture the remote does look kind of  .

kiddy  .

looking , but if you have a universal remote , you won  .

t use it anyways  .

the remote is never a deal breaker for me on tvs , and this one is no exception  .

some don  .

t like the scroll wheel , which i can understand , but even if you don  .

t want to use the scroll , it still functions like a standard remote by pressing up , down , left , right on the wheel anyways as for connections , my old tv had two hdmi ports , which is just not enough  .

this baby had 4 hdmi ports , 2 component inputs , vga (for computer connections) , a usb port , and ethernet port  .

everything you  .

d need to connect it to pretty much anything you want so overall , this tv has exceeded my expectations  .

the picture quality looked even better at home than in the store  .

if you are in the market for an hdtv that is a joy to watch , look no further  .

i recommend this set highly  .

i hope you will too  .

the picture quality is fantastic  .

i have had the tv for three weeks now  .

my sources are over the air hd broadcasts and a ps3 (bluray player)  .

bluray disks on the ps3 are beautiful  .

they look everything like the demos you see in the store  .

even up converted dvds look better than on my old samsung crt hd tv (4 years old)  .

i can  .

t say enough good things about the picture quality realize to get the best picture out of this tv , you will need a bluray player  .

use an hdmi cable for 1080p or a good up converting dvd player  .

i recommend the bluray player ; you will never want to go back to dvds again  .

also , watch out for cable feeds  .

most cable companies re    encode the hd signals at a lower quality , so you really don  .

t get the full effect of how good a tv this is unless you use a bluray player some other reviewers have indicated some drawbacks  .

i is concerned ; so let me put your mind at ease  .

first , the red tint is not distracting  .

it is only really visible in full light  .

secondly , the glossy screen is no worse than my previous crt hd tv  .

the frame is shinier than my previous tv , but that does not seem to really cause any issues  .

if your tv sits in a room that has windows on 3 sides , then it will probably be an issue  .

personally , i use the curtains to cover my windows when i am watching tv  .

and lastly , it is true that the remote control wheel is a little slow in responding , but the wheel can still be pressed on the 4  .

corners  .

like a normal 4    point navigation control , so no real issue there  .

plus i use a universal remote .

after several months of research , i decided to pick up this tv and am i glad i did  .

i hung it on my wall , popped in a dvd (using an upconvert dvd player) and wow  .

it almost looks like you're watching movies made with a video camera    like you're actually viewing live footage of the movie being made the speakers are decent but i highly recommend a nice speaker system    i went w/ the onkyo 7  .

1 system package    very nice the remote has a lot of buttons but do not let that scare you  .

after everything is set up , all you really need to use is the src button and perhaps the scrolly wheel which is a little hard to get the hang of  .

i did some hunting on which settings to use since there are so many have fun w/ this one  .

updated  .

on may 26 , 2009  .

i have been looking at the sony 52 xbr4 for some time now and is going to buy it  .

when i saw the samsung sitting next to the sony , i immediately saw the difference  .

the samsung looked so much better .

i looked at lots of lcd's , read reviews , etc  .

and almost bought a sony  .

however , when i saw the sony side by side with this samsung , i could easily see that the samsung has the best picture and i just had to buy it  .

i love it except for the remote , but i don't even use the remote because i have direct tv and use their hd reciver/dvr remote now i did have the unwanted on/off problem starting a few days after set up  .

samsung has a patch available online to load on a thumb drive and then install on the tv via the drive on the side  .

it totally and easily fixed the problem for me  .

here is the info if anyone needs it    .

samsung a650    series lcd hdtv auto    off firmware update   a small number of samsung a650    series lcd hdtvs (model numbers ln40a650a1f , ln46a650a1f , and ln52a650a1f) have been reported to be turning off automatically  .

samsung has released a firmware update that corrects this problem  .

samsung recommends you install this firmware update on your tv only if you are experiencing this particular issue if you have a usb memory drive , you can download the firmware update for this model from www  .

samsungsupport  .

com/650 and transfer it to your set via the integrated usb port  .

if you do not have a usb memory drive , samsung can send you a drive containing the firmware  .

call samsung customer care at 1    800    samsung (1    800    726    7864)  .

please have your model and serial numbers on hand when you call btw , i saved a lot of money (including no sales tax or delivery) over the b m store prices by ordering online from butterfly photo and had no problems  .

if you are having your satelite company come to install hd upgrade , they will supply the cables , so don't be talked into expensive cables that are pushed by some retailers if you do not need them .

i studied long and hard before i got this puppy  .

i is looking at it's older brother in the 7 series but in that i've a full ht sound system , the 10 watt sub in the lcd did not appeal to me so i went with the 6 series  .

marvelous product  .

sets up in minutes  .

looks beautiful right out of the box  .

extremely versatile with an amazing number of on screen adjustment available to the user  .

best zoom modes i've yet seen remote kinda sucks  .

it's unstable and while its curved case maybe ergonomically correct , it causes the thing to slide on the floor constantly  .

the selection wheel is skiddish and can be extremely sensitive  .

so sensitive as to make navigating a menu tree an exercise in complete frustration but other than the remote , the tvs an absolute champ da worfster  .

after doing research on some lcd's , i is drawn to the samsung 650 series  .

the picture quality is superb and the colour breathtaking  .

i is very pleased with my purchase1  .

just received mine a few days ago and it has been everything that i wanted and more  .

hd signals and blu    ray movies look ridiculous on this display , of course  .

i is worried about watching standard definition television but it looks great on this tv  .

i'm not technical anything but the display must be upscaling or something because sd is looking better on this than my older , smaller tv (46 ) the screen is very glossy , in the wrong place this could be a big problem  .

also the wheel thing on the remote is really annoying  .

it's super sensitive to rotation w/ a delay ; bad combination my advice is to get past these things and purchase this tv at the right price ($2100    $2350) got mine in that range and feel like i got a great deal .

this is an honest and true opinion from a consumer that saved his money for this thing this tv is amazing  .

i don't have the hd hooked on this set and just watching country music videos , i is blown away (i'm not the biggest cm fan)  .

this tv does have a fairly dark red border , if you don't like that it went well with our dark enterainment center  .

all the imputs that are available on this set are unbelievable  .

this tv basically set itself up , i is considering the 750 , but opted for the 650 as it didn't have the preprogramed games , movies , workout videos , and receipes on it ( i implore you to go to your local tv store and find out what i'm talking aboutm to me it was not worth the extra  .

my 650 came with the updated software (i suppose for the shutoff problem) as it is simply tagged on the box , i have had no problems with this set  .

it is simply beautiful the colors are drop dead georgeous and this is just on digital cable  .

the tv will be around 70 pounds out of box , you will need some help  .

the akward part is trying to get the screws out to take the stand off  .

i had to set the tv on its back side for the screws to fall out , so i could mount it flat panel the wheel on the remote can get a little crazy at first , when your a rookie  .

you understand it after a while i strongly urge you to spend the few extra hundred dollars for this tv , i promise , you wo not be disappointed  .

digital cartoons on this thing look amazing  .

love the red frame , which is very dark with reds blending beautifully into black  .

a real work of art  .

forget cnet's pan of the i    pod    esque wheel on the remote   it works great , and adjustments are super easy  .

the picture is unbelievably bright , with colors spot on and unbelievably impressive  .

love the entertainment button and settings  .

click in once and games settings land automatically  .

click again and settings change best for movies  .

click again and settings adjust to best viewing of sports  .

click it again and it turns the settings off and back to normal tv viewing  .

adjusting for best viewing is that simple   one button on the remote the screen is a tad shiny    basically like standard tvs    and if you have a problem with light reflecting on your old tv it'll be a problem with this tv  .

if you don't have a problem with shine on your old tv , then you should not have one with this tv to be honest i'm really nit    picking here , and i seriously doubt anyone except those pestered with direct sunlight will have a problem with this  .

it is not a problem for me , and i'm simply mentioning it because cnet asked to name cons other than screen shine , this tv does not have any cons , and the picture is so awesome that it blows my mind every time i look at it .

i am a fine arts and personal property appraiser and estate liquidator and have a very discerning eye to detail the 650 has an ubelievable picture  .

it feels at times that you are there or watching a play as the blacks are so intense isolating the characters  .

once you get used to it you will find this is a great feature  .

even the sound and voices appear to eminating from the actor's mouths i recently purchased the previous model the 52 665 from samsung which i quickly returned to amazon and got this one , after trying to resolve the issues with a samsung rep  .

the other tv suffered from severe motion blur , jagger , tiple ball effect and ghosting of images that made it unwatchable  .

they suggested the new 650 which had a faster refresh rate and 120 hz  .

they were right  .

i am extremely happy with this set and its compatability with the samsung upconvert dvd i got with the previous model  .

it also is very easy to set up , and operate its subdued red outlined bezel works well with the new woodtone stand/cabinet i bought for it  .

it looks very elegant with its shiny screen as well i have two other lcds  .

a 26 sony wega which is 4 years old , and 40 bravia v2500  .

the wega has excellent true life color , but limited side , top and bottom viewing range  .

the bravia has a washed out unnatural look to the color , except for dvds  .

however it makes up for it with its extreme clarity  .

both the wega , and bravia exhibit some motion blur , especially the v2500 when it records a digital broadcast and the movement in a character's face is distorted the new 650 appears to have surmounted all these problems with beautiful color , an expanded color palate , multi    directional viewing cabilities , with little degredation  .

and thank g    d no blur , triple ball effect or judder as charcters approach from mid ground  .

excellent on screen programming this is the next step in lcd tv development  .

myself and my family are very pleased  .

i purchase this tv just 2 days ago  .

i love it best quality ever  .

it looks great with my ps3  .

lots of video inputs  .

tv looks really good even without hd cable built it hd tuner is great i cant find anything wrong with the tv  .

im happy with it  .

but the remote control is really poor i find myself pressing the some button 2    3 times to get it to do what i want to do .

i have the 46 inch and it has a fantastic picture  .

crystal clear and razor sharp with excellent color rendering and dark blacks  .

it is a snap to setup  .

great on screen menus make it easy  .

i knew the glossy screen had its drawbacks when viewing during daylight since i have 6 windows in my viewing room  .

however , i did not know it would be so easy to compensate for  .

all i have to do is turn the screen a few degrees , easy with its adjustable base , and i can eliminate most of the glare without closing the blinds or sacrificing picture quality  .

i am very happy with it .

i love this set , and despite the minor inconvinience of it re    setting , i would buy it again in a heartbeat  .

the red tint at the top and bottom of the bezel is subtle , as to not be too much , but very classy  .

fast refresh rate makes watching sports a pleasure  .

i love hockey and there is no bluring while watching the puck  .

instant movies from net    flix come through my toshiba laptop very clear  .

blu ray from my panasonic player is crystal clear  .

up converted standard dvd's look nearly as good as the blu ray disks  .

the planet earth blu ray dvd's are phenomenal the remote is a little awkward , but plan on purchasing an all in one remote in the near future overall would rate this set 9  .

2/10 and would buy it again .

i know own 3 samsung's , 50 dlp , 42 lcd and 23 lcd  .

i know that buyers like to be reinforced in their purchasing decisions  .

this leads to hyperbole and exaggeration  .

having said this    if you've been ambivalent about making a purchasing decision for a 52 1080p 120 mhz lcd hdtv , it's time to pull the trigger  .

the samsung 6 or 7 series lcd's are cutting edge  .

i'll skip the technobabble and let you separate the wheat from the chaff  .

aesthetically the sets color scheme and picture quality speak to me  .

perhaps it might speak to you  .

this tv is awesome  .

it has everything i could want  .

the game mode is key  .

i use it w/blu ray and the image looks awesome  .

not a single complaint about picture  .

refresh is high and so many options i do not know where to start  .

the only downside , if you can call it that , is that i always keep the 120hz feature off  .

why , because the manuel says that if noise is produced by the 120 hz function , then turn it off  .

well , i notice that the 120 hz function always produces some noise  .

i only wish the tv came in a downgrade model w/out 120 hz feature  .

the contrast and refresh and game mode and 24p are enough to keep me happy till the new hd software/hardware comes out .

over all an amazing tv  .

will be even better when samsung can fix the resetting issue .

great tv the family loves it we watch it every day , it's very light easy to put up , the swivel stand is great for parties if u want to swivel towards other side of room , the red does not stand out in a room where light is not directly on tv and u can ; t notice it in the dark  .

i is looking at a sony as well but saw this at sears for 1999 on sale  .

printed ad and head to best buy who matched  .

in all very satisfied with this tv  .

bluray movies look spectacular with true vivid colors  .

games on here look great as well .

i mostly enjoy this samsung because i got an amazing deal on it at a website i found  .

they have lots of other great home theater stuff like blu ray players , seating , surroun sound , etc  .

verizon fios (dvr) customers beware there is a known issue with this tv and verizon fios dvr's (currently made by motorola)  .

read more about it here    .

http  //forums  .

verizon  .

com/vrzn/board/message  .

board  .

id  fios_tv message  .

id  6644  .

the problem is actually related to the motorola dvr box and not the fios service or the samsung tv  .

however , since verizon only uses these motorola boxes you are stuck with composite hookups to make this work  .

basically the handshake between the fios dvr and the samsung tv fails often or wo not connect at all this means you cannot use hdmi cables to hookup your new tv to a fios dvr  .

this is very frustrating there are debates on the net regarding how much better hdmi is to composite , but most think hdmi is better  .

it also mean a lot less cables to run just be aware of the problem  .

to fix it , i hooked the dvr up to my old 13 tv in my bedroom and hooked the regular box to my new samsung  .

this fixes the problem as the regular fios box works fine with the samsung tv , but it does have a drawback you can only edit the series manager (add/delete recordings) from the dvr set  .

so , now i have to manage the dvr from the location i watch tv from the least  .

it would be much more convenient to do this from my family room where i watch tv 90% of the time i hope a fix comes out soon , but i'm not holding my breathe .

this is a great product  .

updated  .

on dec 3 , 2008  .

checked ot the sony kdl    z4100 anjhd is horribe at more money  .

returned the same day to keep this samsung  .

overall a great tv especially in standard definiton  .

i is simply superb with all the standard def  .

i have hd with comcasr but like the western channel and some pbs not yet in hd  .

get this at circuit city after doing some negotiating on price .

regret not spending the extra money for the sony .

if you are thinking of a 52 and care about picture quality and an outstanding product , check this unit out  .

happy with my decision to go with samsung after sharp is my first choice  .

you will not be dissappointed and most of my nags about the product , speakers , remote , etc  .

will be addressed by most people's home theater anyway  .

win    win .

white whites , black blacks , great color .

great tv with the original firmware and cnet dark room setting  .

truely amazing picture , sat for days just watching anything on hd boring or not  .

internal speaker would come on when showing it is off , fixed it with firmware  .

problem is now cnets calibration is way off  .

talk about a buzz kill for 3k .

i've had this tv for about 1 week now , the picture is very clear and the overall look of the unit is beautiful  .

i dont like the wheel on the remote , it is sometimes unresponsive making it difficult to use , and i have used a lot of remotes in my day  .

the bezel got scratched by my finger prints when lifting it up onto the wall mount bracket , it seems way to delicate , like you cant even touch it  .

it should have a protective masking that is removed after you install it  .

i would reccomend this unit to a friend .

best looking lcd imho  .

unsure about the 120hz , and the black does seem to turn slightly purple of axis along w/ some flashlighting in the upper lefthand corner and very very slight in the right  .

despite these drawbacks i think it is still the best picture out and still cheaper than sony  .

i am an engineer and they say engineers are never satisfied  .

well samsung , you almost hit a home run on this model  .

why did you put cheap speakers in the cabinet  .

i went back to the store for a second listen and it is there all along  .

it's hard to make out audio quality in a store but it's noticeable  .

like i mentioned above , if you augment your audio experience with a surround sound or other type of audio system , then you have no problem here  .

the bezel is a dark red and i think looks very nice  .

overall , other than the cheap car speakers , a great set .

this samsung set is great for viewing hd satellite programming or blu    ray movies  .

the set is nice and slim , very bright , has great color reproduction and contrast , and boasts an overall handsome design  .

as always the devil is in the details , and this is where this samsung set falls shy of greatness firstly , the menus  .

properly calibrating this tv on your own is a big hassle because of limited menu options  .

there are only three presets , and through trial and error i discovered that the cinema mode is the only one which allowed you to access the warm (correct) color temperature settings  .

oddly you have to alter the presets instead of being able to create a custom setting of your own , a big oversight considering that you can create your own custom audio preset but not one for the video  .

bad design  .

once you check your color , contrast , and color temp settings the set performs extremely well  .

my other complaint here is the 120hz processing  .

after watching for a few weeks i simply cannot get accustomed to it  .

on the highest setting the de    judder processor looks crazy    unnatural and boasts visible artifacts  .

the lower settings are tolerable but still odd looking to my eyes  .

this falls to personal preference as to whether or not you like 120hz on or off , but for my money i think the extra cash dropped on this set could have been better spent elsewhere , especially considering the artifacts present on the high setting  .

with 120hz set to off , and the set properly calibrated though , this tv really shines  .

every blu    ray disc i've seen looks great , well as long as the movie itself boasts a good transfer , and broadcast hd programming looks very nice as well the remote design is my only other major complaint , but boy is it a big one  .

this remote sucks , plain and simple  .

i've owned a few other samsungs and they all featured nice remotes , this one is just awful  .

instead of four dedicated direction buttons this remote comes with a clickable wheel , that can either be rotated or clicked to input directional commands  .

unfortunately the wheel is so imprecise that it's basically unusable  .

you'll quickly decide to only use the click function instead of the wheel , but also quickly grow frustrated with the fact that the wheel refuses to remain stationary  .

be prepared to do a lot of backtracking through menus because of errant commands  .

also the remote sensor is located on the lower right hand side of the television , so if anything is obscuring the view , say a ps3 , satellite box , or 360 , you might find yourself stretching or craning your hand in odd positions to make line of sight contact with the television the glossy finish on this set makes it look great in stores when light is directed away from it's surface , but once you get this into your home it's an outright pain to get it positioned correctly  .

you either have to rearrange your viewing area so that any natural light sources are behind the set , or place the set in a completely dark environment  .

not a big beef because it is one that can be managed , but i think i fell for the sexiness of the glossy screen , in retrospect a matte finish would have been better all things considered this television is very nice  .

i expected more from the 120hz de judder technology , but i've found that it simply makes the picture look unnatural (things seem strangely fast) or it causes visible artifacts on the higher settings  .

on high the 120hz processor creates a heat shimmer like effect on the screen , making watching fast action sequences nauseating to behold  .

of course the solution is simple , turn it down or turn it off  .

i like the flim    like look of standard 60hz 24p video , but if the 120hz processor could render video in such a way that didn't cause me to lose my mind i would be very happy  .

again , let me reiterate that this set is wonderful , despite the shortcomings of its 120hz processing  .

i paid 2500 for this set new , which is comparable to other sets of this size , even some without the 120hz tech , regardless of its flaws  .

just keep in mind that if you do not like 120hz , the hot hd tech of the moment , then you should consider buying a set from a previous generation  .

you can get the same size set for far fewer dollars , but you will be sacrificing color reproduction and contrast levels to do so  .

bottom line   i would , and do , recommend this set to anyone in the market for a 52'' lcd television .

it's my dream , couse if i have this product my life will be happy  .

if samsung makes good on the repair in a reasonable time then i will chalk the experience up as just  .

unfortunate and mildly irritating  .

if samsung says that the warranty has expired and the problem is mine  .

then i will have to make known to as many people as possible they will not stand by their product  .

$2500  .

is just too much money especially the way the economy is now for a lcd that only lasts for a little over 2 years .

i tried both sonys kdl52w4100 and this model side by side for over a week ,  .

glare of this tv is annoying  .

hdtv channels often looked poor compared to sony  .

colors about the same to me on sony and less expensive by a mile  .

bottom line too much glare and poor backlighting and price  .

might not affect others but to me back to the drawing board  .

i feel sonys quality and picture looks better overall  .

i is a samsung fan for a long time but quality has dropped  .

too bad  .

i see they have a new led backlit 950 series now so maybe ill change my mind as you can control dark areas like a map which tells me samsung would rather bring a new model in than address the issue of backlight  .

as far as blu ray i saw no diff in pq between sony and this  .

both were great but no glare on sony as they use 3m filter .

waiting to find out what is wrong with the tv screen  .

it is a very nice picture (except for reflective glare) while it lasted , which is about 4 weeks we phoned samsung , who referred us to a repair person from another town to try fixing the problem  .

it's been about a week now , with no functioning tv  .

no word on when we will get the tv fixed or be given a replacement has anyone heard of this problem before with a samsung ln52a650 lcd tv  .

with every product , there's always an outlier or one with some particular defect  .

i hope i is the only one who is unfortunate enough to buy the defected one  .

the television that i had bought came with a very small gap between the screen and the bezel  .

thinking nothing of this , i ignored it until i passed by it again a few days before the 30 day return policy expired  .

the gap had widened and it seemed like only a matter of time before the entire bezel came off the tv  .

after an unsuccessful attempt at finding a resolution to the problem at the electronic store i bought the tv from (apparently the electronic store that i bought it from couldn't take back damaged items slightly counterintuitive why would i return something i liked unless it was not damaged  .

) , i called samsung  .

samsung conveniently said they could not repair any cosmetic damage  .

the bezel that is falling off due to cheap equipment or glue is cosmetic damage , which rendered the cause of the problem unknown  .

i is unsatisfied with the television but even more so with the samsung customer service and will not be buying any more of their products .

they should recall this tv's and replace all the power supplies fortunately i purchased the extended warranty from bb and they replaced the power supply with a new one with better capacitors  .

i hope it last longer i have even e    mailed david katzmaier to let him know but got no response the bezel scratches easily .

if you have money , buy an ledtv instead  .

although , with my own eyes i can not differentiate the picture quality difference from and lcdtv , the heat it emits is a great factor for me .

motion is awkward , i do not know if it's the image processing or what , but certain motion is annoying and distracting  .

for example , when you are watching motion on a fixed background , things look pretty good  .

as soon as the background moves the entire picture feels awkward as if the motions are not natural  .

people seem to be sped up  .

i'm trying to describe a picture with words but it's almost as if motion is unnatural and exaggerated  .

similarly , if the filming method has the camera in perpetual motion compared to the background this can be extremely distracting for the same reason  .

i have a sony xbr 4 in the house and although the blacks are smoke grey at least the motion feels right  .

i don  .

t know how to explain it but cnet should have some mention of this in their review  .

in retrospect i should have purchased the sony z series but i'm not that disappointed with the samsung .

my biggest problem is that i chose this samsung over the sony  .

i spent a lot of money for this tv  .

it is right in the middle of football season and i am stuck with my old tv which is not hd  .

i am still paying for my hd provider  .

i should have bought the sony .

the plastic bezel around the tv scratches even when using a microfiber cloth and spray made of distilled water  .

i bought a kit especially for plasma , lcd , and led tvs and it scratched this tv to hell  .

it's horrible  .

it is the geek squad guy who came to collaberate the tv that first noticed them and now it has become a thorn in my side  .

i hate the fact that just after 30 days (right out of the return period) this tv already looks like this  .

when i invest in a major appliance , we keep it quite a while and the thought of having a tv that is soooooo messed up already , eats me up  .

when you unpack this tv , there is a sticky plastic protector that is used in packing this tv  .

when you pull this plastic off , it leaves sticky glue on the frame  .

(i'm not sure if this may be the cause of the scratches itself) to get this glue off , you must apply pressure when using the cloth provided and water  .

when doing so , it will scratch the plastic like you would not believe  .

this is clearly a manufacturing defect  .

i also purchased a sony for the bedroom at the same time and it looks nothing like this tv cleaned exactly the same way  .

there are no scratches at all on the sony led , however , the picture does not measure up to the samsung .

it is being returned tomorrow  .

tried all the troubleshooting tips  .

customer service is not helpful at all  .

even changed from satellite to cable  .

picture still blurry especially when there is rapid movement  .

it's better when on 4  3 but then you are only using 1/2 the screen  .

if i wanted that size screen , i could have bought one and saved lots of money  .

not what i expected on an upgrade , cannot wait to get my old tv back from storage .

i purchased my tv on jan 7/09  .

i woke up on feb 22/09 , to find that the control panel , and the remote did not work  .

i did all trouble shooting and that did not fix the problem  .

i phoned samsung and they will not replace the tv  .

i phoned the store where i purchased it , and there is nothing they would do for me  .

so it looks like i paid just under $3000 for a tv that has already broke  .

not very happy    people beware of this product  .

i would not have bought this tv , if i knew  .

buyer beware  .

without any real pip capability , this tv is not much better than a no    name branded tv that has pip listen up samsung  .

only have this tv for 2 days  .

for $2k i should have taken the sony with the same price and same spec  .

i read the review for this ln52a650 and everyone given high marked  .

the tv color changes intermittently sometime and simetime a flash of brightness  .

wasted all my free time trying to change setting and cables/wiring , dvd , calling tech support and input but the color change and flashes still there  .

it become irritating after a while when you are watching the movies i like the side input because i do like to view pictures on my tv and plug in my ps3 game often i is looking forward to showing off this tv to my family and friends for thanks giving  .

now on thanks giving day i am calling tech support  .

they will have someone come over to take a look at the problems in 3 or 4 days  .

but with busy schedule who have time to resolve issues after spending $2k for a tv in a gloomy economy .

infolink will not work as advertised  .

class action lawsuit may be necessary samsung claims its new infolink rss , on series 6 and series 7 lcd and plasma hdtvs , provides content directly from usa today when users connect their samsung series 6 or series 7 lcd and plasma hdtv to the internet via the integrated ethernet port  .

& & & & & it does not work samsung will not provide a refund .

i is reluctant to purchase a samsung product to begin with , but it came highly rated from reputable consumer and electronics evaluators (i  .

cr , cnet , etc) for picture quality and adjustability  .

i decided to go for it and purchased a ln52a650 in october 2008  .

i enjoyed it thoroughly with my 7  .

1 surround sound , hd cable channels , ps3 games , and blu    ray discs  .

then in may 2010 , it began rapidly cycling on/off for no apparent reason  .

a little online research will reveal that this has not been an isolated problem samsung tech support , customer service , and repair people were all very friendly , but that does not make up for the fact that the tv is out of warranty and they were not inclined to do anything about it  .

the earliest appointment is two weeks out and the window is an utterly inconvenient seven hours  .

i took a day off from work , spent $95 for the guy to spend 15 minutes with it , and is told it needed the lcd panel replacement  .

the panel and labor would cost nearly a grand and it would take at least a week for the part to ship from california  .

no guarantee that after the repair i wouldn  .

t have the same problem again it is sad that the reliability with these tv  .

s has been so bad  .

the repair guy acknowledged that they give him job security  .

it is even more disappointing that samsung doesn  .

t stand behind their products more  .

i guess if i had less faith in samsung from the start , i  .

d have gotten an extended warranty  .

i just thought they had better credibility after having read all the reviews  .

now all i  .

m left with is a really expensive paperweight and the solace of knowing that as the  .

go    to guy  .

for all things electronics with my family and friends that i will effectively prevent a great deal of others from purchasing any samsung products in the future .

this tv has excellent picture quality but it is not reliable  .

like the 5 series these tvs suffer from firmware defects such as abrupt tv shutdown  .

samsung took 2 full months to fix my tv  .

so i had no tv for 2 months  .

i decided to sell soon as i got the refurbished replacement and bought the sony w4100  .

much better choice  .

i is always a sony dude but decided to move to samsung and i is disappointed .

great picture , but samsung needs to get their act together and fix a problem that is far too common for this model tv updated  .

on feb 6 , 2009  .

i love the tv , but despise the way that it scratches soooo easily , and that samsung doesn't care , and won't admit it's a known problem , despite having provided them detailed examples of other people that have had the same problem  .

samsung doesn't care  .

they consider it cosmetic and therefore not their problem  .

shame on you samsung , it is your problem and it's a design flaw  .

you're letting a piece of plastic ruin an otherwise superb piece of equipment the scratches really are the deal breaker for me  .

i wouldn't recommend this product , or any samsung product for that matter since they do not care about this design flaw .

samsungs cust svce sucks  .

if you ever have a problem you bought from the wrong company  .

i called with a problem is not helped but put on hold for 10 mins then transferred to the small appliance dept  .

its a tv guys  .

i called back and asked questions from another rep who really didnt want to admit to the problem but only half heartedly in the end  .

i called back only to be told by a supervisor that it is the retailers problem  .

i told her not to dump a technical writing problem on a retailer  .

next i found other horror stories online called their executive customer service at 800    522    7341 she too is full of apologies about my treatment then hung up  .

what is wrong with a company who doesnt address a cutomer problem  .

this company is not on the stock exchange only on the korean exchange  .

some of their executives have been arrested for fraud  .

researching samsung online they have alot of technical problems with alot of their products they want your money but dont want to solve their screw    ups  .

next time i will buy another brand  .

stay away from samsung  .

still awaiting the repair since its under warranty .

we bought this tv as it got a good review by cnet but nothing warned us about the lack of service offered by samsung  .

the tv broke down in the first 10 months  .

samsung sent someone out to fix it but it had to go into the shop and parts had to be ordered  .

it is then returned  .

just three months later it broke down again and now samsung says that they will not fix it  .

this is a $2 , 800 tv and we got less than a year of service out of it  .

i suggest that cnet consider warning anyone considering purchasing any samsung product about samsung's lack of customer service and its refusal to stand behind its products .

i bought the samsung hpt    5064 50 plasma tv on march 14 2008  .

it worked great until about december of 2009 when i started hearing a snapping noise  .

on february 14 2010 the picture went black , with sound only  .

i called samsung customer service and they basically told me its not our problem  .

from what i have been reading on the internet this is a huge problem with samsung tvs  .

there should be a recall on these tvs    this is happening to thousands of people i called a tv repair tech and he said it would probably cost $400  .

00 parts and $300  .

00 labor to repair the tv but could not guarantee it could even be repaired  .

a $1300  .

00 tv should last more than 23 months  .

i will never buy another samsung product again and will tell everyone i know how bad their products are  .

im sure am happy i didnt get rid of my 15 year old 50 hitachi projection tv it still works perfectly .

i have owed this tv for 18 months  .

the other day i powered on and it continued to make a clicking sound  .

no picture and no sound  .

google the problem and guess what , there are 100's if not 1000's of posts with the exact same issue  .

apparently the capacitors associated with the power supply have been failing  .

so , reluctant to attempt the repair myself , i had someone come to the house to repair  .

the repairman would replace the caps but would not guarantee the work  .

with a new complete board replacement , ($120 more) , i would get a 3 month warranty  .

samsung needs to stand behind there products  .

there is obviously a design/hardware problem here  .

oh yea , to make matters worse , i bought a 26 samsung 2 weeks ago  .

never again .

samsung customer service is terrible , even to the point of conflating the problem , i believe purposely  .

they tried to claim the warranty was not bought through them , even though it is clearly a samsung policy , has a samsung logo on it , a samsung number to call for service , etc  .

they did finally admit it is a samsung policy , but only after i threatened legal action i do not trust a company that knowingly sells $2000 tv's they know will break or need immediate service right out of the box  .

it is a scam , and cnet professional reviewer needs to pay more attention to detail  .

the problem is all over the internet , and yet cnet gives it a 4 star review  .

what a joke .
