cnet , you should stop allowing people to review products that are not on the market yet  .
obviously , everyone who has reviewed this so far has no idea what they're talking about .
the new ipod nano really replaces the old ipod shuffle , but now you have a screen and controls and are not limited just to shuffling  .
this is a massive improvement  .
if you are missing the camcorder and video playback and other app features from the old nano , for you there is the new ipod touch , with hd camcorder , imovie video editing , youtube upload , a display worthy of video , and ios apps  .
with how thin and light and full    featured the ipod touch is , it makes sense now to make that the ipod for everything , and make the nano the best choice for those that want a music player only .
a lot of people have already commented on some of the cons for this product  .
i think a lot of people expect that everything that has a screen has to have the capability to play video , play games , etc  .
with the 6th gen nano , apple has essentially made it a ipod shuffle on steroids  .
sure it's a little better bc you can have pictures on it , etc  .
, but the bottom line is , it's designed to be just like a shuffle only with more memory  .
so if you're looking for a gadget that can do everything like video and all that , then spend the money for an ipod classic or touch  .
but , if you're looking for something with more memory than a shuffle , but do not need as many features as the other ones , buy the new nano i used mine for working out on a regular basis and i love it .
my gripes are minimum on this new nano  .
i got it a day ago and all in all i think it's solid for what it promises  .
apple is phasing out all old gen ipods  .
this is sad , but it's business as usual  .
the click wheels of yore will , in a year or two , be gone  .
touchscreen is now  .
if like me you want something for the gym , something small at school and other places , you cannot go wrong  .
the touch features are very intuitive and this is a cool little device  .
it's screen is the perfect size for album artwork  .
also it has the nike fit that is a nice feature  .
overall , if you feel you will use the device for these purposes , it's a buy  .
otherwise , do not updated  .

video on the nano  .
seriously  .
i see the last generation of the nano all over my gym , and i've never met anyone who has shot video , or even still shots , with it  .
apple correctly rolled back two functions that no one wanted or needed , and replaced them with a form factor that is an improvement to everyone i'll reserve judgment on the touch screen controls  .
the scroll wheel and screen combo is a masterpiece of functional aesthetics that will be hard to improve on over all , apple did exactly what they needed to do , they maintained the nano in a perfect position between two other highly competitive , iconic products .
this is my first ipod  .
i bought this because we use macs at work , and i is a little tired not being able to reorganize my music on my zune  .
also , my zune's harddrive has been getting stuck a lot , so it is time to find a replacement  .
the zune has been the only other mp3 player i've owned , and i is pretty happy with it  .
i compared the sound quality of the two , and i cannot tell the difference i actually like this little guy a lot  .
its nice to be able to use it at home on my pc and at work on the mac  .
i also is looking for a flash player that had a large capacity and a radio  .
i is debating between this and the touch and the sony  .
i bought the nano because , honestly , i wouldn't use half the features on a touch and i've been warned of the software of the sony  .
i only used my zune for music and radio , so i didn't see any point on spending money on something with a lot of whiz    bang features that would just collect dust once you get used to the interface , which is a little confusing at first because you expect it to work like a touch , using it and exercising with it is not a problem  .
i just set it to genius or one of my running playlists and let it ride when i run or go through my yoga routines  .
bear in mind , i do not have delicate or graceful fingers , and i find using the touch interface quite easy all in all , i think this is a clever little device that does exactly what it's advertising itself to be   a portable personal music player  .
no frills , no fluff .
i dislike any product which moves to less features , has an inadequate ui and attempts to mask it's shortcomings with an almost meaningless touch screen  .
but if it's a replacement for the shuffle , then it kicks ass except for it's price .
unless i want to use the fm radio at a football game , i am finding myself gravitating back to my gen 4 nano for most uses  .
i like not having to search for expensive cases/clips and dealing with multi    part contraptions just to create an in    line fm radio  .
at the same time , listening mostly to books and podcasts , i find it much more difficult to find my place , especially in a multi    part book , with the lack of precision in moving the touch bar with my finger  .
i do like the 30    second skip back , but it requires taking the nano off , looking at it , swiping to a different screen  .
perhaps each of these shortcomings will improve with skill in using the touchscreen .
when one updates a product , one usually adds features  .
maybe this one could have taken photos , or added wifi for over    the    air downloads , or added more games , or something like that  .
instead , they take away at least ten features from the last ipod nano that i know many people loved  .
people bought the ipod nano because they wanted an mp3 player with nice features , but couldn't afford the ipod touch  .
now none of those features remain apple's low    end device is the ipod shuffle  .
since it is introduced , the shuffle had no video playback , camcorder , microphone , speaker , games , calendar , contacts , notes , alarm clock , or click wheel , like the ipod nano did  .
heck , it eschewed buttons for a generation , requiring one to use apple's headphones to interact in any semi    complex way with it  .
this is why its price point is lower than the nano's  .
that player , not the ipod nano , is always meant to be for those who just want simple mp3 playback  .
now the nano no longer has the feature advantages over the shuffle (at least beyond the touchscreen) ; i see more similarities with the ipod shuffle with the new nano than i do with the old nanos to be honest , the only thing the nano has over the shuffle is a touch screen  .
a tiny touch screen  .
with no other means of input  .
that can only display three lines at a time  .
i don't understand what else apple could possibly be telling their customers here , except you'd better open your wallet more for the ipod touch , because we're in the process of making that product the only one with any useful features beyond music playback  .
apple is the leader in recognizing that users wanted more features than music playback  .
now they're forcing you to pony up an extra $80 for an 8 gb ipod touch if you want to play a game the real kicker is the lack of a click wheel , though  .
when is the last time you saw a non    touch ipod that required you to look at the screen  .
that's what buttons are for  .
so when you're driving with the thing hooked up to your radio , you don't have to look at the screen to change songs and crash into the car in front of you  .
so you don't have to slow down when you're running or at the gym  .
so you can access it quickly from your pocket  .
we all knew the drill   reach in your pocket , flick off the hold switch , press the forward button , flick the hold switch back on  .
now we have to physically bring the fun size screen close enough to our faces that our noses accidentally trigger the multi    touch  .
what  .
and you're calling this the next generation of the ipod nano , the single best    selling mp3 player in history  .
try again , apple  .
if consumers want a simple mp3 player , the shuffle is for them  .
if they want a feature    packed entertainment hub with practically unlimited features , and have a little more money to spend , they buy the ipod touch  .
the nano is what most consumers wanted   a good balance between price and features  .
everything you needed for some good fun , some extra cool stuff thrown in there , at a price point that did not break the bank  .
no longer this product is unreasonable , overpriced , mean    spirited , and disloyal to customers that use the apple logo as a status symbol  .
it has very little going for it , the same mid    range price for low    range features , and is in general a major step backwards from the value that is the last    gen nano  .
shame on apple for what amounts to flicking off their consumers but it does play music  .
and it is an apple product  .
we all know what that means   huge sales .
i don't know what ipod is thinking  .
first , calling it an ipod nano  .
it is not at all like the other models ; i agree with everyone else , this should be a new kind of shuffle  .
actually , they should not have made it at all  .
the interface looks ugly ; the four widgets per screen just doesn't work , and the few that they give you look really awkward next to each other , no matter how you mix it up  .
there is really no point to this touchscreen bs  .
i really don't see it , even in a sarcastic way  .
apple products are expensive , but this small useless thing should've been 70    100 dollars , not 150  .
apple seems to have forgotten things aren't just supposed to be pretty  .
some losers will buy this for the touchscreen , but that's it  .
all this does is play music , with a few tiny perks  .
i cannot see the thing going far  .
i wasted so much money  .
i really won't use it  .
i wo not even give it away because no one should own this  .
no one  .
i hope i can still buy another 5g .
i is pretty surprised to learn right after buying my new nano that you cannot turn the thing off  .
you can make it sleep , and you can wake it up , but you cannot turn it off  .
i thought i must be doing something wrong , until a discussion forum post pointed me to this nugget on page 15 of the user manual   note   ipod nano continues to use battery power after it  .
s been turned off  .
so if you wait a few days between charges , or maybe you threw it in a suitcase or a gym bag       it will have a less juice on it the next time you pick it up  .
from what i've read in the discussion forums , the standby time may not be more than a day or 2 aside from the battery problem (which is the reason why i'm going to return the nano i already bought) , it's disappointing to lose nice features like being able to create an on    the    go playlist in my humble opinion , this is really an upmarket shuffle , not an improved nano  .
and given the choice between this one and my older nano , i'm keeping my old one       it's easier to use and does more .
steve jobs is a rip off do buy ipod to apple go pick another company like sony and sandisk why it has to be ipod it just a name  .
i have owned 3 nanos primarily for use while running and to use nike+  .
the 6th gen is a disaster  .
the touchscreen is impossible to use while running  .
it requires way too much attention and is a complete distraction  .
the on    screen controls are so small that you have to slow your pace to hit them accurately and you have to actually look at the screen to use it  .
i bought the 6th gen specifically to use while running and to use with the polaris nike+ heart rate monitor (the nike+ heart rate monitor can only be used with gen 5 6 nanos) i plan to give this 6th gen to my wife and go to best buy to see if they still have any 5th gens in stock .
this product aims to redefine the nano line into a streamlined portable music player  .
the size and presence of a clip is clearly pitching this as un upgrade to the ipod shuffle unfortunately , a few key mistakes severely cripple the device's ability to excel in this category  .
the size makes one handed operation virtually impossible , unlike with the previous click    wheel models  .
the small screen means much less will fit on there , and coupled with the necessity to make ui elements larger for use with the touch interface , browsing through a large music collection quickly becomes impractical  .
compounded with this is the issue prevalent in all ios devices    the inability to handle long titles gracefully  .
with such a small screen , the fact that names that are too long are simply truncated would be a major headache for a large number of users it would seem that apple has taken the viewpoint that usability is now uncool .
only thing it does is play music , radio , pedometer , and photos    lightweight    great product for someone who wants just a music player , but for a person like me who uses it for multiple things , then do not get it  .
i would give it a 4 or 5 star review if it is $50    $80  .
the $150 price is way too high for this , you can buy a generic 8 or 16 gig mp3 player with touchscreen for $50 or less apple did this for a reason to the nano  .
this is the new era of nano , and anytime they make a new product , they make it with bare minimum hardware and software , and make the next gen of the product have a lot more features , so that you must rebuy buyer beware of this ipod shuffle/nano .
i'm stuck with a defective item that apple refuses to take responsibility for , stating it is my fault it got water in it so unless apple had a disclaimer for users not to use this 6th generation nano when running/working out or to not clip it on your left collar as it would it is designed to absorb sweat that later on would be diagnosed as water damaged since probably a drop of sweat went through the doc connector , i do not think i should be left with a $149 piece of crap  .
i think they should have made it the same size as the past 2 nano's but with a screen that takes up the whole front of the device , keeping all the features .
ok , i think i can explain what happened here   somehow an ipod shuffle bred with a broken zune hd i really don't understand how or why this nano happened  .
i still have my original nano , and adore it  .
i got a creative zen microphoto , and went back to the nano with half the space  .
it is a great product  .
and the newer models have since adapted with newer technologies  .
but what happened here  .
is it just because touch screens are in , and people are gullible and will buy it  .
ok fine apple , make me hate you more  .
seriously this product makes no sense  .
apple has two unique , niche products in the shuffle , the most popular gym music player , and the ipod touch , the only current iteration of a tablet that makes any sense  .
the two should not be combined  .
i mean coffee machines are great  .
wireless mice are great  .
it does not mean you combine the two why apple , just why  .
update the nano (or drop it if that is what you are trying to do) and remarket this as the shuffle  .
what a horrible , horrible idea .
sold my nano 5g a couple of weeks before the ipod announcement for almost list price  .
is going to get a 2010 model with more storage since 16gb is not enough  .
instead apple came out with this useless gizmo  .
left the store disgusted  .
going to take some of my money and get a 32gb microsd card for my android phone , since i carry it to track my workouts' distance and heart rate anyway .
same size as shuffle with touch screen , if i wanted something this small i would get the shuffle , if i want a touch screen i would get the ipod touch  .
this new and improved nano is the worst of both worlds and not worth buying .
