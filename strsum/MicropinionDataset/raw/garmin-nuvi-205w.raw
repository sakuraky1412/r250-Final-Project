Pros:. My Garmin 205W has been absolutely perfect. Charges fine when using it in my car. Been extremely realiable since I purchased it almost 3 years ago. I have 4 205W and every one of them works perfectly fine....... 
Cons:. NONE........... 
Summary:. 205W for my company has worked fine in each and every case we have used it......simple.......never any problems at all with all the ones we have owned.........NONE.......... 

$$;
Pros:. Went to Chicago to see my son. His girlfriend brought her Nuvi 205w. It was a life saver driving around a hugh city when you have no clue as to where you are going! It worked great, easy to use, accurate, very clear. Came home and bought one!. 
Cons:. None, perfect for the price (under $100 at Newegg... no taxes and free shipping). 

$$;
Pros:. The easy enter of your info.. 
Cons:. If I were to complain about anything at all it would be that the battery charge doesn't seem to last very long.. 
Summary:. I like the voiice instructions and the easy info entry.. There is nothing I don't like about it. Oh... wait a minute, it seeems that the battery charge doesn't last all that long.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, ease of use, and food,fuel,and store search within local.. 
Cons:. Doesn't drive the car.......... 
Summary:. This is my first GPS and so far I love it! After reading some of the past reviews with the battery life, I have not experienced any battery problems. I made sure to fully charge it right out of the box. Loving the ability to download different navigation voices. So far Cartman is my favorite. All in all the product is well worth it price I payed for it. On sale for $99 at Best Buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pleasing menus, easy to use, good support from manufacturer, well made windshield mount, standard usb cable is all you need to connect to a computer. 
Cons:. Small inaccuracies noticed with maps, sometimes odd route selections, not as many advanced functions as tom tom.. 
Summary:. I don't understand why everyone is so worried about "text to speech" on the devices. It always sounds odd. If you can't under stand "Turn Left" with the street clearly displayed at the top of the GPS, then you probably shouldn't be the one driving.. This device is very slick and feels like a much more expensive GPS. I've done side by side comparisons with a slightly more expensive Tom Tom, and this does all the same functions just as good, but looks better doing it. The tom tom's display seems more clunky and utilitarian, whereas this seems much more refined and clean.. As a basic GPS and travel partner, this works great. I love being able to find a Thai restaurant close to my location and it gives the phone # so I can call in my order before I arrive.. Garmin supports their product very good with firmware and software updates on a regular basis to improve features and functions.. They also have 60 days of free map updates after purchase in the event they release any new updates.. I received my GPS on Christmas and just got my MAP update in February. They also off some fun extras for customizing you GPS. (Free voices and free vehicle avatars). If you are looking for a great inexpensive basic GPS, buy this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Display big and bright. Accuracy is outstanding. Quite a few features for $150.00.. 
Cons:. I can't think of any.. 
Summary:. Got this at Office Depot for $150.00. Came with windshield mount and I bought a friction beanbag mount for it. Went on an unplanned trip to Moline/Rock Island/Davenport IA area...never been there before and it would have been a NIGHTMARE without this Garmin. It never missed a beat directing me to wherever I needed to go. Only one time was it "inaccurate" about a pizza place, but it put me within site of it. Got me to Walmart to hop by using the "points of interests" feature. The "Where Am I" feature that directs you to hospitals, gas stations, ect. is great. Get one and get peace of mind for road travel. 

$$;
Pros:. I paid $169 and could not be more happy. Plug in and go right from the store and never had to even glance at the directions, nothing tricky and not to simple, awesome size screen with many settings to choose from. I recommend!!!. 
Cons:. In order to receive traffic, weather, etc. you need to purchase the seperate power cord/receiver for bout another bill.. 
Summary:. All in all, I no longer need a map for anything and rely and TRUST fully in "G", My Nuvi has never been wrong about anything, including pinpointing within 1 to 1 1/2 minutes of when I will arrive at my destination no matter how long or short the trip.. Very proud that I have found a product that did not dissapoint me in any way!!!. Updated. on Sep 3, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear graphics. User friendly interface.. Sleek.. Fast loading.. 
Cons:. I can't think of any as of the moment.. 
Summary:. WE bought this GPS so my parents, who came over to visit, can drive around and explore California's POIs. It was easy for them to use and accurate as well. For the price, you can't beat its features. Happy with the purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty accurate, keeps sat reception well, and very easy to use. 
Cons:. Does not say street names. 
Summary:. This is very easy to use and pretty accurate and for the price you really cant beat it. Great for getting from point a to point B and anything else inbetween. POIs could be better but still very good overall and very reliable.. 

$$;
Pros:. This gps (mine) does everything. It is not a mp3. I do not need that It does not cost $300.00 or more and you don"t need that. Mine has voice directions , long story short it works like a charm at the best price. The screen is bright and cleer. 
Cons:. The screen could be a bit bigger, but no big deal; that being said; it fits the case I have for it just fine.. 
Summary:. This gps system price for price and turn for turn is the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Although I have nothing to compare it to, I think this unit rocks. Especially considering the price. (110 from best buy). It is so easy to use. My kids love going geocaching in pedestrian mode. It sure beats using paper maps or print-outs from inet.. 
Cons:. Pressing "agree" every time is a bit annoying.. 
Summary:. I think Garmin has been doing this GPS thing a long time and it shows. Would highly recommend this unit to beginners or to those strapped for cash.. 

$$;
Pros:. Haven't seen what the previous reviewers are talking about. The 205W that I have works well while plugged in. Very good routing ALMOST all of the time.. 
Cons:. Battery life is short. I've had this 205W for a few years and occasionally the routing is demented. The unit sometimes takes several minutes to lock on.. 
Summary:. All except one of the "demented" routes have involved country dirt roads that the unit thinks are usable but aren't. Once from Reagan National trying to get to northern Maryland, the unit decided I needed to go through the surface streets of Georgetown. What a mess! It didn't get me lost but just how it decided that is beyond me.. Overall I like the unit, it has accurately and successfully steered me to hundreds of destinations. Garmin pis*es me off charging almost the cost of a new unit for map updates.. There are the times though when it will badly screw up on the routing and I could imaging that there could be times when that could be a real problem. I really don't have experience with other brands to know whether they occasionally screw up too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, processes info quickly, easy on the eyes and the battery lasts long. I also love being able to add my personalized icons.. 
Cons:. Can still be a bit pricey.. 
Summary:. Oh you'll love this unit,..........its a straight shooter with extras. It does better than "getting it done"!. 

$$;
Pros:. I like that the product is user friendly. Takes you directly to where you would liike to go with ease. Easy to see and read with no confussion. I love the wide 4:3 screen. Good job Garmin.. 
Cons:. I feel that ifor the price, it should also tell you the name of the road. Come on, really. Is that really a feature that you would charge a $100 dollars more for. My other con is, you have to go to menu in order to see the time.. 
Summary:. I still like the product even though there are certain features that should be on there, but what the price is pending on where you go to purchase the item, is good one. If you are looking for a product that is user friendly and actually works, this is it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use interface, ready to use out of the box. Good display and graphics.. 
Cons:. Unable to customize screen (icons, fonts, etc). Unable to change voice. Only comes with a car charger.. 
Summary:. If you can buy this under 150, its a steal! Very good basic functions. It is a no frill GPS system that has gotten me from PT A to B easily.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to set up. A gift from wife, she was able to set it up in 20 minutes, while we were driving to Chevy Chase, MD from NYC. Richly colored screen with excellent clarity, even better on the ears thru a superior digital voice replication. 
Cons:. An annoyingly sounding beep when interfacing with the touch screen. 
Summary:. If you can get this model for under $200, then the basic features and mistake-proof functionality makes this model a bargain. My first driving experience had me listening to the voice prompts more than the satellite radio.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use right out of the box. Great value at under $125.. 
Cons:. No USB cable included, many mini-USB cables do not work with unit. Garmin-made cables not available at most stores.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. nice graphics. 
Cons:. It has twice told me that my destination was on the opposite side of the road from where it really was. U-Turns are a pain. It also recognizes hairpin turns as a "turn" on your route.. 
Summary:. It's very easy to use. When we were on our way through GA to TN, it tried to tell us to get off I-75 make a bunch of turns and then get back on I-75. What would be the point in that? It also told us that the mall we were trying to find was on the left and it was actually on the right. By the time you realize you're in the wrong lane it's too late to get over and you have no choice but to make a U-turn somewhere. Overall this is a nice GPS system.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to operate. 
Cons:. wish it would SPEAK STREET NAME. 
Summary:. We are going to upgrade to probably a 265W because it sometimes announces the turn too soon and there is another street before the correct one and we turn on the wrong street. Of course, we could look at the screen and see the street name, but that isn't the best thing to do in heavy traffic! We also want to have the feature of REAL TIME TRAFFIC which the 265W has free for lifetime. We're not sure if the bluetooth feature is worth it or not. There are so many models of Garmins to chose from it is really confusing---and so many features. The PROS of this 205w is the larger screen is easy to see and its nice to see the little car moving along. The voice is clear. It is easy to program and seems to sense what street name we are typing in quickly. The CONS we already listed. We are going to keep the 205W for at home use and the 265W will be used to travelling/business. Garmin has good tech support via email but their phone support is poor since always a long wait time.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Big screen. -Easy to type on keyboard. -Accurate directions 98% of the time. 
Cons:. -horrible battery quality. -reception takes a while sometimes.. 
Summary:. I originaly loved this gps but the battery problems i have been facing which seems to be a common problem with this model has changed my mind.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a great design, user friendly, and a nice map lay out. It gets you to well known business easy (walmart ect.). 
Cons:. It bypassed my house and a friends house both by two blocks. Very inaccurate. 
Summary:. Some garmins have very high ratings but the nuvi 205w needs a lot of work before I can recommend it to someone. Back to bestbuy we gooooo!. 

$$;
Pros:. Battery life has not been an issue. It charges just fine in both my vehicles. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. There are have been several instances where the Garmin has gotten me lost. One time in upstate NY I was looking for a bowling alley. Where does this GPS take me to? A farm in the middle of no where!. 
Summary:. This was my first GPS and it was also the cheapest at the time. With the few times this Garmin has gotten me lost I just can't tell a friend it's any good. I'll be looking to Tom Tom next.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size and good maps.. 
Cons:. Terrible battery, and not enough tools, options or functions to choose from.. 
Summary:. Based on my use of the Garmin for about a year, I have to say my older TomTom is more user friendly. However the Garmin seems to be better on knowing more roads. Not just newer roads, but really old roads also. The battery has never held a longer charge than 2 hours and now is only about 30 mins. I'm dissappointed with the Garmin overall, but not totally. I will more than lilkey purchase another TomTom. I checked to see if my battery was affected with the recent recall, but it says its not after checking the serial number. I was hoping that was the cause of the poor battery performance.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen size, good features for the price. 
Cons:. It is practically unusable for anything but the shortest trips because of the poor battery.. 
Summary:. It will not charge in the car while it is operating. We have to print directions from one of the driving direction sites as a backup for every trip. I am not a TomTom dealer---just a very disappointed consumer.. 

$$;
Pros:. It can find directions to places.. It doesn't say street names (this is huge, don't buy a GPS without this feature, you'll be sorry, and turn to early or too late, especially in traffic).. 
Cons:. After using it around 20 times (mostly for places within an hour drive from here) it won't boot anymore. I tried resetting it, that was a no-go.. 
Summary:. My wife got me a GPS for a wedding present last August. This thing has a few nice features: points of interest etc. I think I would have much preferred a qwerty touchscreen keyboard to a-z, if a street you're inputting has more than one number in it, good luck (e.g. streets here in Utah have a 100 North 200 East system) it doesn't work well for inputting it.. While owning this GPS, we saved some points (like directions to friends' houses) etc, then one day it decided to not boot up. So I had to clear the user info. That fixed the problem, but we lost all the directions to friends' homes. Then this past weekend when driving to my parents' home in Colorado the stupid thing wouldn't boot up. It would say loading maps, then a progress bar would make it 95+% done, then it would shut off. Rebooting didn't fix the issue. I won't buy a Garmin again. Also you can't buy cool voice packs with this like you can for other models.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very sweet looking GPS, small, light, easy to carry (even in a pocket), nice loud speaker, bright screen and automatically sense the light to adjust its brightness. Loved the windshield attachment.. 
Cons:. Slow, poor design of maps and annoying as heck.. 
Summary:. When starting you have to press "agree" in order to make it work. Every time! Colors of road are so similar to the route color that it got confusing. Hard to tell when to get off an exit. Gave us the wrong route many times. The road on the map was tiny while the car (representing you) was huge, You couldn't tell if you were on a 1 lane road or 5. All road sizes seemed exactly the same. Slow to refresh so it seems more like stills than an animated route. Sometimes it took 5 minutes to acquire the sats, even on a cloudless sunny day. Speaker, while loud, was slightly distorted. Power cord was in an annoying location, making it hang right over your steering column. The way the maps are drawn you couldn't tell if the exit was coming up, or a mile away. At one point I located where I was at the time and set it as a "Favorite" (so I could find my way back later). Later on when I tried to navigate back, it put the location I had saved in another state! I knew something was wrong when it told me it would take me 2 hours to arrive. I wanted to find Union Station in D.C. and it seemed impossible. Never asked me what state I wanted so, unless I knew the street name and address, I could just forget it. I had just gotten it and was using it with a friend (who was driving) and he was so annoyed, he kept asking me, "Why did you get this?" By the time the trip was over, I asked the same question.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easily understandable voice directions; will identify the street, not just when to turn.. 
Cons:. Very poor battery life; will not charge adequately in vehicle. Directions not always up to date.. 
Summary:. FYI, I bought a Garmin Nuvi 250W about 6 mos. ago; this is my second Garmin. I have been quite disappointed with it - for one, the car charger will not charge this unit sufficiently to keep it going while it's turned on, while traveling. Remarkable, I know, for a car GPS, but, according to the Garmin rep. that I complained to over the phone, that's how the unit works (or doesn't work). Why would you buy a GPS that will only get you half way to your destination on an 8 hour trip? I wouldn't buy it again. As if that weren't enough, the maps also weren't as accurate, for some reason, as the older model that I had, which I never updated, and it will occasionally not be able to find a location that the older unit would, or, as it happens, will tell me I have reached my destination, when I'm a .5 mile or more away from it. My next GPS will not be a Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. Display is nice, screen size good, features would be great IF THEY WORKED!. 
Cons:. Poor basemaps, long wait-time for satelling tracking of location, long wait-time for recalculating.. but VERY POOR ACCURACY in locations, and HORRIBLE route-selection for optimal trip time.. 
Summary:. I'm a yacht racer for whom Garmin has always been THE name in navigation. So I was outraged by the poor performance of the nuvi 205w. It took me OFF highways onto routes I KNEW to be longer, through neighborhoods, with lights and traffic -- AFTER updating the software online and changing settings as recommended by Tech Support, who seemed genuinely concerned about the issues. Once I turned onto the better way to go, it took so long to recalculate, by the time it told me the next turn, I was on it! Trying to make an exit at the last second, cutting across lanes in DC traffic, this thing was going to GET ME KILLED. It sent me 16 miles afield to the wrong location for the largest movie theatre in Northern Virginia. I'd be sitting in front of a building that the Garmin was telling me was on the next block. A friend and I both couldn't find a bar because of the wrong location given by our Garmins. On the way there, it put us both on a dark, windy, narrow, unlit, two-lane road instead of the six-lane, 55-mph highway a few hundred yards away, and said to turn left WHERE THERE WAS NO LEFT TURN ALLOWED! The Garmin routinely conflicted with GoogleMaps on my PDA, which always seemed spot-on. Maybe they need to get a licensing agreement with Google. But this unit does NOT "deliver the goods"! Mine is back in the box for a refund.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good sound, great features and easy to use.. 
Cons:. It quit on me every time I used it and finally died for good after being used 10 times.. 
Summary:. This unit was great when it worked but it didn't work very often. It would go off completely every time I used it before I made it to my destination. After using it 10 times, it died and will not come back on. It seems this has been an ongoing problem and it is disappointing that Garmin does not correct this problem or replace these defective units after 30 days. I will not buy another Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are none since it doesn't work at all.. 
Cons:. It doesn't work at all. 
Summary:. I had this unit for about two months before it stopped working. When I turn it on it displays the garmin startup logo and then the screen flashes and the process starts over. When it does this I can't even turn it off, I have to wait for the battery to die. I can't try to reload software or firmware because my computer won't recognize it since it doesn't fully turn on. What a complete waste of money. It also doesn't have a reset button which would be convenient. It's not like i even dropped it to cause this malfunction.
