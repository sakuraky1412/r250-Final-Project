he confirmed that the building can only be heated or cooled and they use heat at night and cold during the day , they are in the midst of appealing their owner to update the rooms , and that the front desk encounter was most likely due to a language barrier .
i replied to his email offering a couple of suggestions , such as a sign informing guests about their odd climate control system and also mentioning that we had cool air at night when we started our stay .
the quality of the rooms and the lack of hospitality of the front desk staff are more like a locally owned and managed motel , do n't expect any quality assurances normally provided by an international chain known for high standards .
i went to the front desk staff and was told that the air condition was turned off and the whole system was on a heating system . . .
so every night we slept with the sliding glass door open - our sleep interrupted by the occasional late night scooter on the road , a conversation in the courtyard , or the one night when a fly decided to roam around the room because the sliding glass door does n't have a screen .
about mid-way through of the stay , the climate control would only provide heat even when the setting was on `` cool '' .
when we started our stay , the air condition worked fine and kept the room comfortable during the day and night .
i interacted with a couple of their front desk behind-the-counter staff and each time they seemed annoyed .
the temperature outside was very pleasant for november , but the room would heat up because of the amount of sun exposure .
in regards to the staff , the concierge , bellhops and gym staff are very hospitable and top-notch .
