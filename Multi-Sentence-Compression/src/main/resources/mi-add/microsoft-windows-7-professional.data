i'm one of those people who is skeptical in upgrading to windows 7 from xp  .
tried exploring it first on a virtual machine and later on i decided to upgrade my xp to windows 7 and never regretted ever since  .
security is still a concern so for those people worrying about this , it is recommended to install an anti    virus  .
in terms of performance , xp and 7 is just about the same and in some cases 7 performs better tried exploring my old pc with windows xp and i immediately noticed the things i missed from windows 7 , especially in terms of accessibility  .
like windows 7 customizable libraries for your documents , jump list , etc the design is flawless , looks really clean and uncluttered unlike xp  .
aero peek is elegant and really useful which makes you peek on multiple applications or folders in full screen before deciding on fully using it updated  .
on sep 16 , 2010  .
i am a professional , and i use my computer for high end 3d animation , long form writing , music production , video editing , and a lot of other demanding tasks  .
i don  .
t game or do much social networking  .
for me , the user interface improvements and new features of windows 7 have been a big boost to the bottom line of getting work done  .
i have found the new and improved aero interface , the new taskbar , and the hordes of other thoughtful little features very welcome  .
i often have many windows open doing different tasks simultaneously , cutting and pasting between , say , word and the web , working on textures in illustrator and photoshop and rendering the results in maya , etc  .
all these jobs have been noticeably improved by using windows 7  .
the whole look and feel of windows 7 is such a vast improvement that xp looks dated to me now  .
i still have an older xp box that has mostly been relegated to my young children , and i can really see the improvements  .
s nice to see microsoft finally hit one out of the park  .
the operating system has been trouble free , noticeably faster than the vista it replaced , well documented and (usually) very easy to use  .
the upgrade from vista feature worked exactly as advertised without a hitch the feature that makes a window automatically resize to full screen can be slightly annoying when i  .
m trying to put two windows side by side  .
i find it odd that the run feature is turned off by default , and it is a bit troublesome to figure out how to turn it on  .
we had some networking issues , mostly involving my wife  .
s vista machine and the older xp box not being able to see my machine  .
i am getting an  .
unspecified error  .
when trying to run the disk check feature  .
it complains a recently added program is interfering with disk check and stops the process  .
it has left my local dealer scratching his head  .
the libraries feature could be more flexible for people like me who don  .
t store everything in my documents , but put it all under something like a dada directory on a separate hard drive  .
this arrangement has saved my bacon many times and i  .
m not about to do anything else  .
i can  .
t comment about the hardware requirements  .
i have an i7 box with 6 gig of ram , a midrange nvidia quadro and 2 1    terabyte drives  .
i haven  .
t tried loading windows 7 on one of my older machines , but i have an aging pentium d at work which seems to run 7 fine .
i'm going to keep this short   i love windows 7  .
i had xp running on my older computer (from about 2006) and i figured it is suitable for what i used it for  .
then i got my new pc with windows 7  .
boy is i amazed the second i started the computer  .
the os took about 1/10th the time my previous pc did just to get to the desktop  .
also , i frequently run multiple apps simultaneously , including guitar hero iii , skype , ie 8 , and a program called procaster (used for streaming live video)  .
surprisingly , i hardly get more than 20% cpu usage and about 60% ram usage (thanks to the nifty gadget on my desktop  .
) doing all this at the same time  .
overall , it is a very , very polished os , both aesthetically and internally  .
i particularly like how microsoft went for the clean look but did not copy mac os x  .
i can imagine it would be easy to make a mistake like that  .
this is an unbiased statement , by the way , because i also have a macbook running mac os x 10  .
6 , and trust me , i use my pc much more than i do my mac now (rather than previous to my new computer , when it would be the other way around) if i had the choice of having a very good computer (spec    wise) with xp or a decent computer with windows 7 , i would probably choose windows 7  .
it's much more pleasing to use and if you've had xp for a while , it's time to upgrade  .
i think what i like most about windows 7 is that it is so well ironed out       an ï¿½ber version of nt  .
the  .
net framework , meanwhile , makes the platform eminently programmable  .
the gui is practical yet pleasant to look at  .
windows 7 plays all my games  .
it's packed with features including great backup  .
the security level is encouraging and enables a person to have at least some confidence when using windows 7  .
i even like and use ie 8 now  .
after reading the first out reviews , i had to try win7 , seeing how i skipped over vista , after seeing early reviews  .
xp is ending it's updating soon , so i went to win7  .
becoming trained as a graphic artist required becoming proficient with the mac os , and i never feel really comfortable on the macs , but learned to tolerate , then like them  .
after the first month or so on 7 , i began getting the same diffeerent feel mac os10 has , and the same familiar auromatics i developed with xp  .
i said to myself and now you  .
what has ms done    created a monster and how can anyone top this  .
too bad the security people couldn't come up with a way to improve outlook express enough to keep it  .
i still like a simpler email program , and urge ms to redevelop it  .
outlook is basically the same thing , but has too much repetition , and is slower  .
g    mail seems like it's set up for kids , and i only have the account because i is forced to , in order to have all the mail features those are the only thing i have to   about everything else is an improvement from xp , and from what i read , they kept the few good things from vista  .
the biggest surprise i can see , is the user interface is real similar to the mac os  .
since i doubled and tripled my ram rom from my 8 year old sony , things are consistently faster , and i have to say , get all the memory you can behind 7 and you will love the living daylight out of it  .
can you imagine running a pc all day long , and not ever bogging down  .
keep your filters , and cleaners running in the background , and you can go all day long  .
norton360 and iobit product , or any other ms partners are essential one more 'con' that i saw in changing over  .
if you are a seasoned vet on any other os , you most likely have developed 'automatic responses' when doing things  .
i mean , like , you do not have to think where to go , and anticipate the next step in doing your tasks  .
it takes some getting used to the new interface , and ms did move things around , from what xp was  .
it's a good idea to take a week off , just to play with it , and get used to where everything is , to get in the groove , to pay to cost to be the boss with this a    1 dy    no    mite system  .
you may not go to bed all week  .
great product for both work and home use .
windows 7 pro is a must get if you want to get rid of that hideous vista  .
it's a great work around and really fast bootup and does not put unnessesary programs onto your machine with a clean install  .
this is microsoft's work of a success right after xp  .
this os will most likely stand as long as xp lived .
greatest operating system (os) ever created as far as pc's goes  .
i will admit i haven not used macos's too much , so i cannot really say much about them  .
but from what i have experienced of other os's including linux and mac , this os is my favorite by far  .
i never had windows vista on any of my desktop or laptop computers  .
i never even used on my school's computers  .
microsoft did itself a tremendous amount of damage by releasing windows vista before windows 7  .
vista is more of a beta version of 7 the bottom    line is this   if you are a windows xp or earlier user afraid of upgrading to vista , don't worry anymore  .
get windows 7 and you will not ever be disappointed  .
want more reasons for why i'm so confident in this new microsoft product  .
i completely formatted windows 7 and reinstalled a fresh copy of windows xp to see if i could live with it  .
i couldn't  .
i lasted about 2 days with xp and had to go back to windows 7  .
the difference is huge  .
windows 7 blows away the competition , and if it were not for microsoft's flop (vista) they might have stolen the os market  .
instead the gave apple a big boost by releasing the ugly beast known as windows vista okay let me stop the vista hating for a little bit  .
back to the good windows 7 get it , use it , love it .
first off i like windows 7 a lot i like it enough to convert all the pc's in my home to windows 7 , the most basic computer in my house has 1gb ram , intel celeron d at 3  .
06ghz , and windows 7 runs smoothly enough on there my mum is first unsure about windows 7 but she even likes it and she is a novice when it comes to computers , she did have windows xp on there , but she finds windows 7 quicker and easier to use then there is my laptop it has an intel centrino 2 duo @ 2x 2  .
0ghz it runs smoothly on there , i get over 4hrs battery life where as before with windows vista it used to have 3hrs  12mins battery life due to the fact my laptop is never idle  .
now let move onto the features  .
i use devices and printers a lot i find it is more simple as when microsoft asked me what would make windows simpler i said a place where i could see all my devices instead of the 5 or so clicks you require to get into windows device manager windows media center  .
i use windows media center a lot as in the uk we do not have anything that comes close to tivo yet so i have freesat running in windows media center and use it as my main dvr  .
my favourite feature is if it misses a program it will reschedule for example i wanted to record scrubs but there is already two programs recording , it would reschedule scrubs to the +1 channel also if you get the chance try the microsoft office 2010 beta it is really stable and is easy to use .
overall the operating system seems stable and much more reliable than vista was  .
it even preforms much better than vista , i have proven this  .
in vista ultimate 64 bit , my system processor usage at system idle is about 35% to 45%  .
in windows 7 ultimate 64 bit , my processor usage at idle is about 1% to 3%  .
that right there says it all  .
windows 7 is no where near as demanding as vista and i personally like it better than xp  .
so i guess the bottom line is i would most defiantly recommend this operating system to anyone  .
it's actually great , and once again its microsoft  .
it does what every you want it to quick  .
my xp had more errors  .
i'm amazed at the error free pc i've have not had  .
i've used 95 , 98 , 2000 , me , xp , vista  .
and i will say windows 7 has been the best for me  .
the sound features make the music i play sound great  .
the internet connection is quick  .
you can have a slide show of pictures for your background on your desktop  .
the cool graphics used for the taskbar , ect  .
does not slow it down like vista did  .
highly recommended  .
i bought win 7 the day it came out , and it has been great   ) .
much better than xp , much faster than vista , and more secure than sl .
when i bought my first vista pc about 3    4 years ago , i is almost immediately disappointed in the abundance of challenges in using this supposedly intuitive new operating system  .
i swore i'd give ms one more chance , if only to avoid replacing all of my windows apps and data and losing what remains of my hair  .
windows 7 did not disappoint after 4 months of use , i have experienced none of the errors and hiccups i had almost immediately with vista  .
whereas vista would pop up nearly every minute asking me to approve internet access or other activity in the applications i is using , win7 does this perhaps once and moves on  .
win7 works well with my norton antivirus/antispam , while vista constantly queried me on the application and made it a monster to handle  .
streaming to other laptops is far simpler now  .
bluetooth error messages are a thing of the past  .
my cpu and ram are far more efficiently managed than with vista i really like the interface , including the informative task bar icons and more easily managed gadgets without repeating all the comments of others , i can simply say this   after years of utter disappointment and frustration with vista , i am one very happy win7 user  .
my only complaint is that ms should've given all vista upgraders a discount , not just those who purchased a pc in '09 .
i work in support and help desk , and now my life is more easy , i can doubble the number of systems per day from dos , w3  .
11 w95 w98 wme w2000 wxp wvista , i think microsoft for very first time offers and give the same product .
windows 7 should push people to let go of their old xp computer and get a new w7 one  .
it's time to move on and microsoft has , without a doubt , delivered a great product that can run on a much greater range of computers .
it works great  .
now compare to a mac  .
it doesn't do anything  .
i actually want to play games and use applications  .
people think macs are best cause there are no viruses  .
well , there are  .
they are as bad as the ones for vista  .
remember conficker ver b  .
it hits macs to  .
other than that  .
macs are for simple stuff  .
pc's can be upgraded with parts  .
mac have to be completely replaced  .
i'm an extreme gamer  .
i built my own top of the line machine  .
macs cannot even handle as much speed as my pc can  .
even so , macs cost so much money and when you want to upgrade , you basically throw your mac out and by another one  .
what a waste  .
mac's are really just a ripoff  .
i say go pc  .
never have problems , always have speed , no freezes locks crashes or stuff like that  .
i want to replace my gpu  .
pull it out put a new one in , install a driver and i'm done  .
mac's cannot do that  .
i want a faster processor  .
i pull mine out and put in the new one  .
mac's cannot do that either  .
if you like the mac layout , microsoft has programs to make it look like a mac  .
i am a key microsoft beta tester who is vital to microsoft  .
i test every os they come out with and get copies for free  .
2 windows 7 professionals  .
mac's do not offer that  .
i say go pc all the way ï¿½j wgames 2010  .
the ease of installation and the fact that it actually works on a netbook is a surprise  .
seems to be working very well with the hp 1035nr netbook with 1gb of ram .
must have upgrade to the best windows yet .
i am a mac user who recently bought a dell studio 14z with windows 7 home premium for my wife (she insisted on windows because she uses it at work and found microsoft office to be easier to use with windows)  .
since buying the computer , i helped set her set it up (which didn't take any effort at all) , and found myself very impressed with windows 7  .
it is definitely much more functional than previous editions of windows and after adding an external blu    ray drive , connecting to our wireless printer , i can honestly say it is even more plug n play friendly than my mac  .
the interface is elegant  .
i like the combination of the dock and start menu , while the gadgets are a nice copy for mac widgets  .
plus being windows , hardware choices are much more plentiful (something i really miss on the mac)  .
maybe it's just that it's a new toy to play with , but i find myself wanting to use her computer much more than mine  .
it is a really nice machine with great software something i have not been able to say about windows for a long time now  .
i will definitely consider a pc for my next computer .
i is forced to buy a new computer in june 09 as my trusty almost 7 year old dell with xp professional died  .
(lint in the fan  .
) it is too soon to get windows 7 i did not want to get stuck with an outdated xp in a new computer , so i pre    ordered windows 7 home premium from amazon at a cheap price put up with vista till it came out  .
vista crashed almost every day  .
when i opened outlook it would freeze i would have to re    boot  .
i received win 7 on oct 22 , but is chicken to put it in till i heard how other people liked it  .
then 3 weeks ago i got up my courage expected to spend the day on the phone with microsoft  .
surprise    installing it is a piece of cake and the computer has not crashed or frozen since  .
little by little i am discovering all the little improvements like snap , peek , shake etc  .
but what impresses me the most is it's stability  .
so far so good  .
ps my husband has a mac which i know how to use    i like this better  .
goodbye vista and hello windows 7  .
the best os i have seen yet  .
i'm running ultimate x64 bit and everything is so accessible and easy to use  .
windows 7 is appealing to the eye and definitly worth getting  .
especially if you're having nightmares with vista  .
enjoy  .
it seem funny that mac users are having numerous slowdown and crash after upgrading to snow leopard  .
windows 7 is the os that everyone have been waiting for  .
windows vista could be consider a 3    years beta for windows 7 because windows 7 is rock solid  .
those get a mac commercials now seem more like a joke .
microsoft rewrote the whole explorer shell , which it long overdue , and made a lot of changes to windows media player which was not exactly a good program before version 11  .
overall its pretty good  .
if you are running xp or vista , i recommend you at least upgrade or do a clean install .
i definitely give microsoft credit  .
i upgraded from vista basic 32bit to windows 7 ultimate 32bit and it's running smoother  .
it has a nice look and feel , and the super bar with the new options is a nice touch  .
though , even on windows xp and some older versions , you could always pin an icon to your task bar which created the same effect by going into the view properties and selecting large icons as the windows 7 advertised super bar  .
the difference is the aero effect that it adds  .
i really do like the effect , but don't think it is worth the advertising the ability to pin or unpin something to your tool bar the ability to use gadgets on your desktop is a pretty cool feature  .
much like the feel of a new cell phone these days  .
we all love our free applications that we can place anywhere we like  .
eliminating the side bar from vista is a big plus  .
i didn't like the fact that i had to open that and have that running just to have one gadget/application on there  .
now , on 7 , we can just have the gadget on our desktop and close it if/when needed aero snap takes some time getting used to  .
sometimes , instead of minimizing a window , i would push it as far off of the screen as i could , leaving just enough room to move it back  .
well , on 7 , once your mouse hits the side of the screen , aero kicks in and it's ready to take up half (or all of) your screen aero shake is great for someone who's too lazy to click on the minimize buttons on every screen but the one they're on  .
virtually useless if you have nothing to hide or don't get distracted easily but neat if you do have things open and you're using an instant messenger while running downloads or multiple pages in the background and you just don't need them ; shake them away  .
this way your conversation does not get interrupted for 30 seconds to minimize the 5 or 10 windows you have open  .
which why would you have that many open as it is  .
also    aero shake is available for downgraded windows  .
i had it on my vista , as well as the glossy glass effect that vista basic never offered  .
that and a shnazzy tool bar on the top of my screen along with microsoft's very own tool bar that you get with every windows , maybe that's why 7 seems like such an upgrade  .
to get the effects i desired most on vista , i constantly ran the aero effects and other boot programs all at the same time    thus slowing it down  .
though i liked vista at first , it took longer than i liked getting used to but once i did , going back to xp or anything lower is a task of its' own  .
with that said , the upgraded windows 7 is easier to get used to on the first day alone , and competing with xp in performance , it's only a few service packs away from being better than 98 and xp combined .
the perfect operating system in every way  .
a reduction in price and it will be the best operating system of all time  .
windows xp and windows vista fans have a lot to look forward too , since this is a truly great operating system .
go ahead and change vista or xp its obsolete microsoft finally did the right thing perfect  .
this os looks a lot like vista , but under the hood it performs a heck of a lot better , is more compatible and probably the easiest to use microsoft os by far .
i hated vista because i could not manipulate large files , mostly images and video  .
compared to xp , vista is a total bust for me  .
with multiple users , the more vista is used , the slower and more unstable it became  .
i have been running vista for a few weeks now on three systems with multiple users and it has exceeded my early expectations  .
managing files and editing video content is fast  .
please note that i did not upgrade any hardware  .
the only change has been moving to windows 7 pro 32 bit .
bottom line    .
windows xp is old and ugly  .
vista is modern , but too much too fast , so if you did not have enough ram , you are probably a vista hater windows 7 is like xp , except more modorn and prettier , and has a better 64 bit mode  .
but xp can run on my 416mhz pc and not windows 7 no problems to date  .
{except that i installed it on my dell 9400 and consequently the video card overheated and killed the video card , only letting me boot to an external monitor running unix}  .
definitely going to replace xp sooner than later as the dominant os .
i have installed windows 7 on a 64 bit vista machine and a 32 bit xp sp3 machine , both installations were flawless , and smooth  .
i have been so impressed with the new features and functionality that i now have a renewed faith in microsoft as a company for the future and have purchaced there stock  .
windows 7 new tool bar management feature is enough to buy the product for , but it also has enhancements to help manage your in    home wireless network .
i agree with this review , but i take issue with the speed comparison between vista and windows 7  .
certainly winxp is usually the fastest os out there , but we're talking about an 8 year old os that cannot hope to compete with the newest ease    of    use features included in the vista kernel nevertheless , i find windows 7 much , much faster than vista in every way  .
one of my biggest peeves with vista is the way in which it handled ram and virtual memory  .
i suffered through terrible performance lags and overall sludgy response  .
with win7 , i notice speed along the lines of winxp , and i'm running this on a single    core amd athlon with 2 gigs of ram the os is peppy , responsive , and incredibly versatile  .
throw in support for the latest and greatest software , hardware and graphics libraries like direct x 11 , and it becomes clearly the best choice for a windows os , period  .
i cannot justify staying with winxp and sacrificing all the new features of win7 just for a minor speed increase  .
i just cannot windows 7 is the best of the bunch , and i'd recommend it to anyone too nervous to leave winxp (just take the plunge and be glad you did  .
) , or someone contemplating the buggy mess that is vista .
if you use microsoft windows this is the way to go  .
i'ts the best os from microsoft ever .
great upgrade  .
windows promise that this operating system just works is true  .
i cannot remember the last time i installed a os and it just worked right out of the box  .
by the way , installation on my machine took approximately 15 minutes  .
i love it and i would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a new os , including macheads ps    i upgraded from vista 32 bit , clean install .
found everything (installation , booting , shutting down , ui) to be much more intuitive and user friendly  .
overall i'm very impressed , and it's a nice improvement over it's predecessor (vista) .
after reading some of the reviews about may not be worth upgrading from vista , i am glad i did and is certainly worth it to me  .
would recommend to anyone who is on the fence about upgrading to any version from home on up .
i'll be moving all my pc's to ms w7 and so far no regrets  .
i'm selling my apple macbook pro and going back to microsoft  .
(wow , i cannot believe i said that  .
no more clutter , ovearall experience is great good buy vista  .
i like this product because of useful features like aero peek , aero snap , homegroup , jump lists , live taskbar previews , pin , sleep/resume , the new taskbar , windows live essentials (free download via windows update) , windows media center , windows search , and windows xp mode additionally , i like this product because of functionality like the design , the windows hardware and software ecossystem , the responsiveness , the security and the wireless networking finally , i like this product because of the excellent experience me and my girlfriend have been having with it ever since we installed in august 2009 (thanks to msdnaa) imo , as far as oss is concerned , it goes like this   microsoft windows 7 apple mac os x snow leopard linux for these and other reasons , microsoft windows 7 is imo the best os ever developed and currently available updated  .
on oct 23 , 2009  .
i have been using windows 7 since the early days it got available from torrents  .
it's been almost a year and i love it  .
things got simpler yet more effecient since vista  .
i have used windows since version 2  .
0 and this is my best user experience the only windows version that apprared to me so surprisingly cool is windows 2000 after 98 .
it is a good product i have been a select tester since last december it is good then  .
in january to now over 8 million poeple downloaded and tested the beta and release candidate it became faster and more refined so any of those comments that say it is vista all over again of that is is slow and sucks are from someone who saw that it is comming out and has a mac or a grudge againt microsoft (vista mabey) and has never tried it  .
so go to your computer store try it out and if you are a student you can get it for 30 bucks www  .
win741  .
com  .
after using xp for a long time , i decided the os was not doing it for me  .
i'm an extremely lazy man and i like everything to work well  .
id like an intelligent os that fulfills my basic tasks but makes them easier  .
aesthetics aren't very important for most power users , at least for me  .
its functionality  .
windows 7 does everything im thinking , and to my surprise it actually helps when i'm having compatibility issues , etc  .
now the thing that is almost hair rising to me is this   i have a sony mp3 player and i plugged it in  .
device stage is not all that great i thought  .
now i used my normal media monkey to pass a song and the mp3 didn't recognized it  .
it is mp3 , what the hell  .
then i removed it and drag and dropped it and windows said   this device may not be able to play this sort of file , would you like to convert it  .
and as soon as i clicked yes like it is transferring normally it is converting all the mp3 files that could not be played  .
i'm sure you can even choose your bit    rate and other advanced options but 192 is good enough for me  .
very smart os  .
and it does so even in video  .
i dragged and dropped some vids and it made them mp4 , with the screen size of my mp3 and it looks beautiful on it  .
and is 1/5 of the size  .
for a person that's tired of looking for converting software this is a miracle  .
i love this os  .
ive used all others including ubuntu , and while safer as they may be , nothing beats functionality  .
had to learn that the hard way .
i'm enjoying windows 7 .
you cannot go wrong with windows 7 .
minus the game i could not load and play normally , this is by far , my favorite operating system  .
it just works and looks beautifully  .
i have already installed the final product of the ultimate edition , but have been using the release client since it went to the public  .
i am throwing a windows 7 release party this coming sunday , and feel that i would do microsoft justice and have already sold a couple people on upgrading their system to windows 7  .
since i am throwing this party through a website called house party , i received a signature edition of windows 7 ultimate , but i already had it ordered through the half    off pre    order special microsoft ran in july  .
since i received the ultimate version for free , or sort of free for throwing the party , i cancelled the one i ordered  .
you will be happy if you upgrade .
i've been running the final version of windows 7 for several months now , both 32    bit and 64    bit versions of ultimate  .
i've been beating the os up a bit trying to make it crash , trying to find issues , and meanwhile doing every task i expect it to run in the long term , in the hopes of finding an issue to date , i've found 1  .
just 1  .
that's pretty amazing  .
the 1 issue i've found may have something to do with being based in canada , and content rights  .
the issue manifests itself in media center , when 'automatic content downloads' is selected my created dvr    ms files in movie library crash media center , both on the host and via an extender  .
de    select the download option    no more crashing  .
very strange error , and a pain to be sure       without the option , i lose sports in media center , which is a shame on nfl sundays aside from that single error , i cannot heap enough praise upon microsoft's altar of windows 7  .
the os is solid , corrects every misstep made in vista , and improves upon many of the deficits the xp mode available in pro / ent / ultimate is wonderful for legacy applications and usb support of legacy devices  .
its a shame the graphics driver in xp mode cannot be something more flexible , to run graphically intensive programs , but a minor issue to be sure the sleep mode and general laptop support is absolutely brilliant  .
sleep mode actually works how it should       i can work , close my lid and send the pc into sleep , move around , open up my lid and immediately start working again , my wireless connection active instantly and all programs intact and i can do this for hours and hours , extending my effective battery life incredibly  .
sure , sleep has been around for a long time , but w7's implementation is the best to date  .
i've seen some people poo    poo windows update , but its neither better nor worse than its ever been , and in my experience , its relatively painless evenwith critical updates program and device support is near 100% of what vista supported  .
if anyone is going to maligne w7 for not support legacy xp    era applications and devices , consider that xp has been effectively replaced for 2+ years now cannot blame w7 for this  .
that said , the built    in compatibility modes for past os versions (98 , 2k , nt , xp) is pretty impressive       a use can select to run an application in 98    compatability mode , and suddenly that ancient printmaster program lives again  .
i'm impressed while vista introduced many 'neat' features that were ultimately useless and unnecessary , very little in w7 is either of these things  .
microsoft really delivered a product that cuts down on frills , and still raises the bar on my overall usability experience again       impressive if you are sitting on the fence for service pack 1 get off the fence  .
w7 is ready to go , day 1 if you are living with vista       do yourself a favor and upgrade if you have an older pc or notebook       say , 5 years or less , with 2gb of ram and a decent hard drive       fear not windows 7 you will likely have no problem running it one final note consider going for a grand slam pair windows 7 with a windows home server  .
they work really swell together , and these days , everyone is buying a laptop either turn a pc into a home server , or buy a new one (they are cheap) , and use this as your home base for storage , backups and tv recordings and make your windows 7 notebook or netbook (fleet) truly mobile powerhouses  .
you'll be glad you did , with this setup .
aero peek is really cool , and so smooth , i have a new imac with snow leopard at work , windows 7 on my work laptop (dell latitude e6500 a pretty fast laptop) and the 7 dock is much more functional  .
i've been a windows user for 15 years and this is the most intuitive , user friendly version ever , it will actually challenge os x that area  .
this will be well worth the upgrade price for most users  .
updated  .
on oct 22 , 2009  .
when i had to switch back to vista from the beta release of windows 7 i felt like a small part of me is being ripped away  .
now , i am re    united and i am realizing how much of a differance windows 7 makes in my day to day life  .
anyone who opens many programs/documents at once will really appreciate the new interface , and everyone will appreciate the speed  .
on my computer which is purchased in 2006 (upgraded to 3gb ram and improved gpu) it took less than 40 minutes for a clean install  .
immediately my printer worked without any setup , and the rest of my devices were recognised and installed immediately  .
i love the new customization options , and i especially love desktop background slideshows  .
search is noticeably faster than it is in vista , and indexing is almost instant  .
users will appreciate the speed and responsiveness of the system  .
so far , mine has never hung up , and i have a dated 2ghz singe core processor  .
programs are also more responsive  .
zune , which had diffuculty playing videos on windows vista , plays videos crisply and responsively , a benefit i had not expected  .
power users will appreciate the less intrusive windows 7 uac .
cnet's review is pretty spot    on  .
windows 7 goes beyond being just good enough , it the best os release microsoft has created in a long time and it just shows  .
with windows 7 , vista users should upgrade without even thinking ; and xp users can confidently and finally abandon the horribly out    dated and now pretty much ancient windows xp .
windows 7 is what vista should have been  .
makes better use of resources , easier for home netwoking , more secure , reliable ,  .
and on my 3mb of memory , intel core 2 duo 2  .
20mhz , 32 bit laptop runs grate  .
running a variety of programing ui's and business apps with no problems  .
mark@tek    plus    solutions  .
net  .
i had no complaints when i is on rc1 other than i is a little concerned because it didn't run well on my msi wind netbook  .
i have technet so i have the rtm now  .
i installed it on my netbook (win7 pro) and it flies  .
don't bother with the starter edition they want to put on a netbook  .
pro does fine  .
the starter may have better battery life than pro on a netbook , but i get two and i am fine with that  .
also loaded it on my desktop with the same results  .
fast , efficient , secure and stable  .
without any malware protection on yet , i got one of those you have been infected windows  .
i clicked on it just to see how well 7 protected me and it immediately flagged me with uac and blocked it  .
mac commercials now are referencing the xp systems , because they do not have anything on 7  .
kudos to ms on this one .
i did get a copy of the beta test os and tried it out  .
it is very smooth , and for a beta surprisingly or not it did not crash on me  .
i had the desktop running for a week straight  .
do not listen to the negative reviews  .
i am sure most of them are from people who have never touched the os  .
its definatly worth the upgrade .
during my installlatiom of win7 i turned on all my devices , which include 3 printers , external hard drive and a scanner , it found and correctly identified all the brands , epson , canon and hp  .
my tv dvr turner card works better then before  .
everything loads faster  .
i is able to install a 10 year old program that would not in vista  .
so far this is the best new windows version yet  .
now i will make the leap to a 64bit os .
windows 7 is twice as good as all the negative reviews seen  .
honestly , 7 is safe reliable and user friendly  .
vista is a wash , and some people cannot let that go , cannot people understand that microsoft can learn  .
and it did superbly  .
they played this one safe , by not completely redesigning the kernel , hence nt version 6  .
1 (vista is 6)  .
this is good , because of all things i liked about vista (ui , and taskbar) remained primarily the same , except for the taskbar , which is much better on 7 (no words just icons)  .
7 is a much better vista , and trumps all other oss before  .
please stop dissing a great leap forward , just because you're stuck i the past oh , and if you say 7 requires too much , look around the technology that is required to run 7 is already outdated  .
so leave windows 7 alone .
differences from previous windows operating systems    .
from windows xp to windows 7    .
you have literally nothing to lose  .
with windows virtual pc you can fully emulate windows xp sp3 while having all the windows 7 features at your disposal  .
it is easy to setup  .
you first gotta go to your bios to turn on your specific pc's virtualization settings  .
you do this by clicking esc or f10 (varies for pc models) when you first load up your pc  .
next you download the windows virtual pc program and install it  .
finally you can download the windows xp virtual machine  .
you can then open up programs in windows xp or just load up a window with all of windows xp in it  .
you can go full screen and you won't even know that you are on a windows 7 pc until you exit it  .
the virtual windows xp and windows 7 share the same clipboard and hardware which is pretty nice ; you can copy something in xp and paste it in 7 from windows vista to windows 7    .
windows vista is horrible in terms of performance  .
many people did not want to upgrade from xp to vista because vista is slower than its predecessor , however this is not the case with windows 7  .
windows 7 is actual fast from my experience  .
my pc (which sucks) used to take forever to load xp  .
when i installed windows 7 the loading time became bearable  .
i estimate it went from 1min+ to 40sec  .
feature wise there is nothing windows vista can do that windows 7 cannot do  .
windows 7 is compatible with all windows xp and vista software and devices , with it being faster than vista and having more features  .
i think it is pretty safe that we all bring out our ak    47s and shoot our copies of windows vista to oblivion from a mac    .
mac  crap windows 7  operating system  .
operating system crap  .
my favorite features    .
windows 7 has awesome features i like  .
the feature i like the most is the new task bar , that is right , a new task bar  .
the new task bar is awesome  .
most of you reading this review are familiar with how the task bar (the bar at the bottom of the screen) looks like ; it has been the same from windows 95    vista  .
well it has changed and the new one rocks  .
it is too awesome to describe so i suggest googling it  .
then there comes the great performance , and how the ui is more eye    candy than vista  .
installed with windows 7 are many themes which include sound packs for the system  .
built into the system now is the ability for multiple wallpapers that change periodically without 3rd party software  .
alot of things that previously required 3rd party soft , like burning isos , are now built    in  .
networking has been improved from vista and gadgets are now built    into explorer  .
a cool feature i like is to make every window invisible to see the desktop or to shake the current window you are holding to minimize every other window  .
if you drag your current window to the left of the screen , it will cover half of the left screen  .
same with right  .
if you drag it to the top it maximizes  .
you can drag a maximized window down to return it to normal size the major problem with windows has been fixed  .
tired of getting pop ups every second telling you your system is not secure , an unidentified program is requesting permission to , and error  .
well you can , for the first time in ages , turn it all off  .
you can higher or lower it , please check the image below to see what i mean there are a lot more things i can say about windows 7  .
if you want to find out more try it out yourself cons with windows 7    .
the only cons of windows 7 are cons of windows itself (from all windows versions)  .
there are no drawbacks from upgrading to windows 7 from vista or xp whatsoever except for the loss of dreamscenes (which suck) and that the movie maker for windows 7 is still in development (you can use the windows xp movie maker or another program) there are a lot more things i can say about windows 7  .
if you want to find out more try it out yourself while you still can or go and visit other sites about it score    .
performance   9  .
better than vista , on par with xp  .
faster boot time and shutdown time than both  .
9 for not being 2    3 times faster than xp (i wish) visuals   10  .
upgraded aero and multiple background themes compatibility   10  .
virtualization technology makes this one a winner productivity and management   10  .
many new shortcuts , better taskbar , upgraded programs  .
made for 2009 and ahead gaming and media   11   p  .
directx11 comes to gaming  .
wmp12 , and media features all got upgraded security   9  .
depends on your software , but windows 7 is very safe  .
i never got a virus though on any pc since i know how to use a pc   p  .
9 because it is possible for a fool to get a virus overall   10  .
what can i say  .
i love windows 7 and cannot wait to try the 64bit version  .
i give you a 100% valid nerd recommendation of windows 7 .
in total , windows 7 is a great , solid , operating system , and i hope to see more of this kind of stuff from microsoft .
gonna be the best yet .
microsoft nailed it perfectly with win7  .
the perfect balance of function and asthetic appeal , windows 7 is a hit updated  .
on nov 2 , 2009  .
the taskbar is awsome  .
i've been testing out the beta's for a while now and the progress they made have been amazing to be frank  .
features like snap has made my life so much easier  .
it's kinda hard to go to a large screen (22 +) and not appreciate those little features i love the new taskbar , it's the necessary evolution for a person who uses quite a few applications all at the same time  .
and because of it apparent quickness , i'm not as frustrated when i start things the new wallpapers are both trippy and beautiful  .
everything screams smooth , and i really appreciate aero peek  .
again it's one of those things that seem like a fantastic evolution to something that can handle multiple applications at the same time and speaking to multiple applications at the same time , it's one thing cnet seems to be missing in their report  .
running lots of applications at the same time in 7 is ridiculously smooth in comparison to xp  .
apps always start fast and always respond with the same swiftness  .
that's probably the best part of 7 i've seen to date .
overall i liked windows 7 because it is snappier than vista , ran all my programs new and old , and makes it unnecessary to search for new drivers for my existing hardware and peripherals because the ones made for vista just plain work without issue  .
i actually enjoy using this operating system .
i really like the way that the system runs and the way its laid out  .
it is the fastest most responsive system microsoft has maid yet  .
i think that xp users will want to switch and i should know because i is i hardcore xp fan and i hate vista yet i switched to windows 7 and i love it  .
the best version of windows out there , finally microsoft done something right  .
when i got my laptop with vista , i is going to downgrade to xp  .
but when i found out about windows 7 i d/l the rc  .
much better than vista i love it  .
must have for all vista owners  .
upgrade now  .
simply because its the best os from windows  .
to be honest , i am only running the rc , so the rtm can only be better  .
advice to new users ; the new taskbar may seem annoying at first , but dont change it back (as that is quite possible , and easy to do) to the vista/xp design  .
once you are used to it , you will agree that it is worth it  .
it should only take a few hours to get used to  .
when i tried xp mode , it is too choppy for gaming , though that may have changed , and if it did not , it is not built for gaming anyway  .
this is a must get for me when it comes out  .
until then , windows 7 rc all the way  .
much faster than xp  .
its now time for xp users to upgrade  .
definitely worth the upgrade and yes , it's a great upgrade from xp .
being a windows xp pro user , and after trying vista home premium for a while , i decided to go back to xp  .
i decided to install the release candidate of windows 7 , and could not be happier  .
i is amazed at how stable , and fast windows 7 was  .
i love how the performance of my computer improved compared to vista  .
the programs and menus are much more responsive , the memory usage is much more efficient , and the all around performance has improved dramatically  .
i would compare this os to being very close to the experience that i get with running my imac using leopard great job microsoft , and i've put my order in for my windows 7 upgrade , and cannot wait for it's release  .
i think that microsoft has finally created a very modern , feature    rich operating system that has very few performance issues  .
the interface is engaging and usesful , even running on a pentium 5 such as the one in my laptop  .
i'm looking forward to loading the operating system onto both of the computers in my home    and i've already pre    ordered my copies .
i've been using windows 7 since the beta is released  .
normally i would never use a beta os as the main os on my machines , but right away i knew this thing is solid and installed it on all my machines  .
i never looked back i is never a hater of vista , in fact i quite liked it  .
i never experienced any of the ills so many people complained about  .
but win 7 takes the essence of vista and perfects it  .
the taskbar is the main reason i switched all my machines  .
after using it i became frustrated trying to go back to xp or vista and being limited by a useless button  .
the new media player functions rock , especially being able to stream media over the internet and networks networking is a breeze to setup and/or troubleshoot  .
xp is a nightmare , vista made progress , and win 7 takes the guesswork out of it  .
adding devices is a snap , and the taskbar is cleaned up and much more practical overall this is a fantastic os  .
i use both windows and os x , and this really gives leopard a run for its money    in speed and beauty .
since the beta stages windows 7 has proven to be a solid and reliable os i've been using win 7 x64 rc1 for the past month and frankly it wipes the floor with vista 64 and xp in terms of performance and user experience  .
decompressing a 7gb file took 4 minutes in win 7 compared to 20 minutes in vista  .
ram and cpu usage is kept in check nicely and never spiralling out of hand like vista did so far i have not found broken apps (photoshop , illustrator , office , 3d mark , etc ) or games (cod 4 , warhead , l4d , sf iv , bionic commando , etc ) , all software and drivers that works on vista (and even some that did not) work fine in win7 this is far more than vista was , it is a completely new experience  .
similar to os x in some ways but lacking the built    in pretentiousness designed to attract the mocha crowd and at the same time allowing you far more control over your computer than apple would ever allow .
the future of computing is here .
best os  .
bottom line is that i will use it , suggest that my clients use it after we determine it works with their apps i will suggest the pro version , as most of my clients are small businesses they , ms , has got t odeal with the pricing/upgrade issue though .
installing this os in your pc is like breating new life into it , everything runs faster , even games , cod 4 , devil may cry 4 , street fighter 4 , pro evo soccer 2009 , burnout paradise they all play extremely well my desktop is an old pentium d with 4 gigs of ram and a geforce 9600 gso video card previously i could run all the games with high settings but now i can max everything out and plays perfect i already ordered the final product , simply amazing  .
this is the best os on the market to date  .
it is a combination of the functionality and reliability of xp and the visuals of vista  .
this os is compatible with everything .
get it now  .
but do not pirate it .
in the same way that i miss some of the vista features when using xp , i'm finding that i miss certain 7 features when working in vista .
let's face it , os x , windows , linux , it comes to functionality with a hint of brand preference  .
i've used all three in work and home environments  .
i used to hate mac's little time bomb before i even witnessed my first blue screen of death  .
i've recieved viruses on os 7 by mac when they said they did not get viruses  .
photoshop works better on windows based on my experience as well , let's get away from what's tabeau  .
face facts , it's an amazing feat that windows can keep a robust secure environment with the giant target on their backs  .
windows 7 appears to balance everything quite effectively , ease of use , security , functionality , innovation , etc a very good product overall  .
much more useful than mac os x , but mac has a ways to go to catch up with the experiences microsoft has gained with their enourmously popular , and widely used product  .
os x is functional , but not up to par yet  .
they'll get there though one day if they keep aggressively persuing their business model bottom line , windows 7 is the everyone operating system , i cannot wait to see how they adapt to their environment .
this is on my full time production laptop (it director) its this good  .
im totally amazed and pleased as well .
i gave windows 7 a 5/5 in comparison to vista , which i would have rated a 2  .
5/5  .
for a new user , win 7 is probably closer to a 4/5  .
it's not perfect , but it's very good the real difference is that 3rd party applications and 3rd party drivers work  .
companies are actually building their software to work with the os unlike with the vista release  .
this has always been windows largest strength  .
the high level of 3rd party support in addition to a solid operating system makes windows a very good choice for a new system or an upgrade (especially an upgrade form vista) .
installation is exceptional , the new taskbar is phenomenal , and i believe that microsoft has finally put their foot in the right direction since xp  .
people who use xp will be surprised to realize that windows 7 is actually a heck of a lot fast than vista and xp  .
although , if you are already happy with xp there is not a good reason for upgrading unless you want the faster boot  .
simply , windows 7 does everything that xp does , just more elegantly , and quickly  .
and an xp hybrid mode does not hurt either .
if you give windows 7 a chance , i am sure you will love it  .
i would have added more pros but cnet has limited room   ) .
windows 7 is a significant upgrade from vista and certainly worth the extra effort needed to upgrade from xp  .
this should be the os everyone moves to this year or next .
i'm waiting patiently for the rtm version , although the rc really is just fine .
in summary , windows 7 will be worth every penny  .
anyone who decides to stay with xp or vista is totally insane , with the one exception of people using hardware more than 10 (yes , ten  .
) years old  .
anything newer will run windows 7 faster , and better , than xp  .
(trust me , i've been using windows 7 rc as my only operating system for 3 months , and windows 7 beta for the 3 months prior to that and i'm using a bottom of the line , three year old laptop  .
in a phrase   better than vista xp in every way  .
windows 7 has to potential to be the new xp or 95 in terms of longevity and consumer adoption  .
people will love the ui enhancement and subtle changes that make tasks easier and actually fun to do  .
simple window management tricks itself are godsend microsft hit it out the ball part on this one  .
everyone says they do their best work when their backs are against the wall and i guess it's true  .
trashing vista rightly or wrongly fueled this release which is phenomenal .
what vista should have been .
very pleased with the changes done with windows 7 so far .
amazing turnaround of windows .
let's face it , vista got a bad rap  .
call it rushed to market , or call it , somewhat of a shifting point , or just plain poor support on launch , microsoft had a lot to prove in this version of windows  .
one of the challenging things for an os of its market breadth is trying to be as much as possible to all the people that the os serves  .
for the windows xp users windows 7 represents a true current gen operating system  .
from the cleartype font support to the responsive changes in the taskbar , this version of windows screams improvements  .
all the rage see the blogsphere seems to be things like chrome os and the always stylish osx  .
i am typing this here on my macbook pro with windows 7 rtm installed and i must say i see no need to go back and forth between osx and windows    i am happy to say i am a windows user once again and throughly happy with this product  .
with things like aero peek , jump lists , directaccess , and much improved desktop search i am really digging this os  .
the smaller design tweaks are more impressive to me however  .
the action center , reduced clutter taskbar , and things like transitioning wallpaper make the experience equally and in some ways better then the osx that partion is getting smaller and smaller       ) a lot has been said about the competition out there in relation to a cloud os  .
today nothing google could put out could rival the fantastic experience of this os  .
i imagine it will be hard for anyone to put out a web os that will match the slickness of this os so bottom    line    this is a worthy upgrade for all the windows xp users (the experience is like night and day  .
) for those vista users still sitting on the fence you might as well jump    in because to be honest , the speed at which this os operates is impressive  .
less resources , better memory management , tweaked ui windows 7 is a fanastic os updated  .
on apr 23 , 2010  .
i myself use vista as my default os at home , and i like it quite a bit , but as time passes and windows 7 gets closer and closer to releasing , i am noticing more and more issues with my vista machine  .
such as being very slow and responding poorly too  .
my graphics card crashes a lot which is annoying all i can say is i have tested both windows 7 beta and windows 7 rc and they were both great and windows 7 rc had many improvements and i cannot wait to see how many improvements rtm has  .
(i have pre    ordered windows 7 already   ))  .
why have the editors reviewed 32    bit edition of 7 , when you guys should be reviewing 64    bit edition of windows 7 which outperforms the 32    bit edition of 7 this is the best os out there  .
plays games much better than both xp and vista did and outperforms both in performance security  .
i do believe this well be the best windows sense windows 95 .
my answer will have to be based on my experience with my 1st pc , equipped with windows xp and it's replacement   a pc that had  .
windows vista home premium pre    installed  .
i would compare the vista equipped to a new baby , but a premature new baby  .
it , like the preemie has spent more time at the hospital (the repair center) than it has at home .
i love microsoft  .
vista is superb as well , but had some evident problems  .
when 7 came , i quickly switched to the rc , and eventually ended up buying the retail pack  .
thanks cnet for your videos and discussions on windows 7 updated  .
on apr 10 , 2010  .
i think this is going to be another big timer for windows  .
and it's chances are going to be even better now that microsoft is ditching xp  .
this is a huge improvement and i think it is going to be the next xp .
i have no problems sharing in the great work they did with it  .
i have put the same on all my pc's .
windows 7 takes software to the new decade .
get windows 7 on your next pc purchasr plan or when you plan to upgrade your pc .
at last microsoft after many years have got it right  .
everyone (especially the people at microsoft) held their breath at the release of windows 7  .
only users stuck (poor souls) with vista switched immediately  .
i , personally , didn't expect too much from microsoft much in part due to their previous touting of vista (which , as everyone knows , is an epic failure from expectations)  .
however , a recently marketing ploy which allowed me to purchase an upgrade to windows 7 for $30 lured me into buying it  .
users transitioning from vista will find the upgrade fairly easy (and thanks to modern coding , the install looks more like your normal os than xps ancient text based installer)  .
the data backup for users switching from vista is nice , though , leaves a few things to be desired (obviously , they cannot preserve your programs due to the installation of a new registry)  .
however , if you are a skeptic like me and are upgrading from xp , you'll find yourself having to manually move things over yourself or lose all your data  .
the windows 7 installer will prompt you (if you choose to use the advanced install) if you wish to leave your old windows install intact (leaving all your data on the hard drive for later access)  .
if you have the room , you can select yes and it will copy your entire hard drive into a folder called windows  .
old  .
this is a colossal waste of space  .
though , in hindsight , if you don't want to lose everything , it's helpful (you could do this in xp , but it was not explained) once the installation is done , mostly without any hitches (though , there is one point 80%    ish through where it seems to just hang though it will finish if you are patient) , the desktop is shown and your breath is taken away  .
it looks a lot like vista (which , in retrospect , is the only good thing about vista ha vista i get it guys) , but the speed of 7 is readily apparent  .
for those of you who are using a dual    core (or more) system , you will find the speed increase over xp (and therefore , obviously , vista) highly noticeable  .
for those of you with a very slow dual    core (probably below 2  .
0 ghz) , you'll probably see small gains in terms of speed , but not much  .
if you have an ancient single    core pentium 4 , do not bother upgrading  .
xp will run faster for those of you with 7    8 year old computers having said how nice windows 7 is , let me expound upon the cons (as i'm sure that's probably what more people are worried about)  .
any of you who witnessed the horror of multiple crashes , multiple installs , hangs , deaths , and otherwise ridiculous shortcomings of vista and managed to steer clear of vista will find yourselves slightly miffed  .
having used vista (sadly) and upgrading back to xp , i found myself in the nice position of being used to windows 7's interface  .
however , since i had been using xp for a while , things were a little difficult getting used to  .
the control panel has many more icons which help you adjust things (if you are non    technical , this can be confusing)  .
the way 7 does the task bar is also slightly disorienting (though , you'll probably end up getting used to it and probably liking it)  .
windows 7 has a nice feature called roll over  .
what this means is , you can roll your mouse over the task bar tab and the desktop will be turned transparent so you can see whatever is going on (in real time) in the tab you just rolled over  .
also , if you are using a program (like msn messenger/live) that has options you can set in the program , you no longer have to open the program to do so  .
you can simply roll your mouse over the program tab and the options will pop up for you to change (without the need to bring the program to the fore)  .
moving off the seemingly pro section commentary , another gripe you may find is the quick launch bar  .
many of you may never have used it , some of you (like me) used it a lot  .
in xp , you could just right click on the task bar and choose to use the quick launch bar  .
not so in 7  .
in 7 , you'll need to google adding the quick launch bar to windows 7 in order to get a 5+ step instruction to adding the bar  .
hopefully , something they'll change in the near future (though , once added , the quick launch bar works exactly the same as in xp)  .
the final gripe (though , not for me , as i have a fairly beefy system) , is that users with lower end systems may not be so pleased with the speed increases from upgrading from xp to 7  .
as i mentioned before , those who's computer specs are fairly low (or you have an old system 5    7 years) , will see very limited speed increases  .
also , windows 7 is fairly taxing on the graphics side (though , this can be turned down)  .
so if you find yourself needing to upgrade in order to use windows 7 , i suggest you stick with your current os all in all , i find windows 7 to be the answer to pc users wanting the aesthetics of a mac while keeping the power of the pc  .
mac users may also find this a somewhat appealing compromise  .
while i is skeptical int he beginning , windows 7 has been done right  .
a+ microsoft .
native drivers list is great  .
even my 2002 era scanner worked  .
not to mention my video capture hardware  .
all of my old software will work again , and i can keep my three virtual drives as they are  .
very impressive .
smooth install (clean)  .
so far no real problems  .
my old system is 10 years old and i thought it is fast  .
64 bit is the only way to go  .
microsoft did well on this one .
i is really uncertian about win 7 but it's been great so far  .
my computer is 3 years old and can only use 2gb of memory  .
all of my programs ran better and at least 40 to 60 percent faster in win7 pro  .
i am an amatuer photographer and my photo editing software is much faster in win7 internet  .
internet access and operation is much quicker with win7  .
setting up a home network is a breeze  .
i like the ui and am still learning where to find different things but it is time to upgrade from xp and this is a great upgrade  .
laplink has a win7 upgrade tool that makes saving and reinstalling your programs a breeze and you do not have to reinstall all of your programs  .
cnet tv has a good video on how to upgrade from winxp to win7  .
i bought my wife a laptop with win 7 at bestbuy and they offered an upgrade version of win 7 pro for $99  .
95 , which made it an easy choice for upgrade .
first , just to let all the same laptop users know i successfully installed windows 7 on my dell inspiron e1505 which is about 4 years old  .
i have had windows 7 installed for about 3 days now , i upgraded from xp my parents and everyone else i know jumped in on the vista hype while i just sat and waited ive had to constantly help others fix their vista problems with little to no knowledge of the os itself and it is horrific  .
my tweaks and fixes which i used on xp didnt work very well or not at all on vista  .
7 on the other hand is another story so far , i have been surprised by w7  .
it is actually running more smoothly on my laptop than windows xp did  .
that is a wonderful thing not only that , there is a lot more i can do to make my system more efficient i love the taskbar , i love the navigation , i love the simple and sleek design of the entire os  .
i know 3 days is pretty fast to praise a new os , but im set in stone  .
w7 is the true successor to xp  .
it is what vista should have been updated  .
on dec 3 , 2009  .
i had to purchase a cheap laptop to continue my studies , while my powerhouse laptop is in for repairs or refund  .
at first i is in pure hell  .
without noticing , i had purchased it with vista home basic  .
the system is incapable of the most basic functions without slowing down or crashing (the app , or the system) after researching ways to upgrade i found out that microsoft is giving a near 80% discount to students  .
i jumped on it that night  .
although i had already tested windows 7 before , i had done it on my powerhouse laptop  .
i was not expecting too much from this weakling laptop (presario cq61)  .
i is completely wrong i'm happy to say  .
windows 7 is making the best of the lowly specs  .
i have a tendency to run all of my graphic design at once , and the new os handles them without too much effort the only downside is that a few programs are not compatible at all  .
so far if you attempt to play a cd with winamp , the system will crash  .
the problem has never been fixed since the rtm version also the system crashes when i try to open adobe encore files from cs3  .
i'm sure there are several more land mines like this , but both are relatively minor , and i've worked around them updated  .
on dec 3 , 2009  .
being a user of windows 7 for one week i have had no issues at all , no crashes yet  .
just really a good os  .
for some reason ie runs faster than google crome on my windows 7 pro machine and loving ie .
windows 7 is a very nice upgrade to windows vista , more than a facelift  .
the only comaplaint is with the windows taskbar  .
when you are running only a few programs at a time and they all have icons , then there is not a problem  .
however , with many applications , there is no icon for the program , and you see a big string of blank icons going down the bottom of your screen  .
the next is also about the taskbar  .
when there is a program like internet explorer , all windows that are open have to be accessed from the one icon  .
this means that you have to hover the mouse over the program's icon , wait for the little program menu that has the open windows to pop up , and then you can select the window that you want to work with  .
this is , in my opinon , very ineffective and has a lot of problems for people who need to get work done fast  .
besides these issues with the taskbar , windows 7 is a very fine addition to the microsoft line of operating systems .
if you have xp , get rid of it  .
you will love 7  .
strongly recommended version of windows from me  .
which din't happen with right away either xp nor vista  .
xp got better at least  .
vista didn't care to do  .
windows 7 right away passes the recommendation level  .
i usually don't compare windows with mac bcoz which really does not makes sense to me windows 7 good to go  .
glad to have vista off of my computer for good  .
this appears to be windows done right (or at least a lot better)  .
since vista has come out i have purchased two apple products , maybe this will let me hold on to the windows computers i still have .
this is a long time coming  .
it's fast , efficient and it's friendly  .
manzana should take heed , win7 leaves no doubt of the value of pc's running their newest operating system .
must try it will really change your thinking about computing .
best replacement for windows xp by far  .
before windows 7 i had a dual    boot setup of windows xp pro and windows vista x64  .
i used vista for all of my high definition multimedia side and xp for all of my legacy applications that had trouble with vista  .
with windows 7 i will be able to migrate all of that into one operating system that can handle all aspects of my computing needs , thanks to xp mode  .
i will be able to effectively eliminate hundred's of gbs (approximately 250gbs) in use by the multiple operating system setups  .
vista is useful for my hd video editing setup , but is slow in performance  .
windows 7 should prove quite stable since the code it  .
s based off of is from vista (as xp is built off of windows 2000)  .
it may be off some of the similar coding , but its improvements in speed , reliability and features make vista a laughing stock of operating systems  .
vista in many ways is another windows me (which is replaced by both windows 2000 and xp and is the most stable operating systems since the win 95 98 editions)  .
in all windows 7 has been a blast to use and has not given me the famous xp screen (blue screen of death) to date  .
the system is stable and for someone that uses a high definition setup , you cannot be happier  .
just by installing windows 7 and the video card and hooking it up to my tv , its blue ray ready (hdcp capable)  .
that is a huge improvement over xp that requires countless downloads to enable support for newer technologies or capabilities such as directx 10 for xp  .
with windows 7 , it just comes standard with directx 11  .
in all it is a great replacement for the aging (8 years plus) windows xp and is capable of becoming the industry standard that vista failed to become updated  .
on oct 26 , 2009  .
its great i think its more useful than vista and uses less resources  .
its not as efficient as xp is on system resources but as long as you have 2 or 3 gigs of ram it should run just fine .
i love this os  .
it is playing nice nice with all my hardware , and i did not have to do squat to get it to do that  .
i really like that  .
there are so many little details that microsoft has done right this time , it's hard to list them  .
no one big thing , just lots of little things , that make this windows a joy to use  .
installation is drop dead simple , i did a custom clean install from xp pro , and even having to back up my files and contacts is easy peasy  .
i'm not sure i appreciate the lack of an email program , i am so used to outlook and outlook express  .
but thats a minor gripe , i'll use the cloud till i find the program i like well done microsoft .
libraries allow one to (superficially) group all the items of a type under one category , eg  .
videos  .
new taskbar allows one to de    clutter the taskbar and organize various items and also peek through the windows , however , it leads to higher access times because one has to first hover around the icon and wait for the thumbnail to switch to another window  .
touch capability sounds exciting  .
personalization is a good feature as it allows for various cool themes and auto desktop background switching  .
among the accessories , the inclusion of the scientific calculator is appreciable  .
the new paint interface is also good  .
windows 7 also seems to be utilize lesser cpu and ram (by as much as 50%) , though it may be because of fewer start    up applications as of now  .
overall , it's a good os , and will be able to over    shadow the failure of vista .

Reliable, intuitive, efficient; None yet that I have found.
Speed. Visuals. Performance. Gaming. Security; Refresh of Vista albeit a darn good one.
user interface is nice, performance is very good; not yet all softwares are compatible
Super cool interface, Great backwards compatibility, Makes me feel like a Pro.; Can be improved in many areas.
I like its changes. I you haven't tried yet, you should do it.. XP+Vista=7; Not yet Compatible with some apps.
User friendly.Easy to load. Runs well on older systems.; Not much support for OLD sound cards.
Outstanding user intuitive features, beautiful desktop themes, STABLE!; Having to wait until October for the final product.
Aero Peek, Stability, Appearance, Security; Price and the Microsoft lock in
Great speed, great UI, great media.; Still duplicate applications that do the same things - they could save disk space by reducing. No XP upgrade.
Boots fast, very stable, nice interface, just all around great experience!; None that I can come up with.
Some Innovative Technology,. Stable,. Good Response to User Feedback,. Support for all (MSDOS to Vista, i guess using XPM!); Windows Explorer sometime stop responding due to heavy antivirus realtime scan activity.
It feels more stable, loads faster, sleeps faster, and uses hardware more reliably. It also works really well on my netbook.; Could add more features.. IE8 disappoints (always has)
Ease of use, hardware options, responsive, compatability with peripherals made super easy!; No multitouch option for mousepad on laptop (may be hardware issue)
much faster and more reliable than any other OS; expensive but worth it
Windows 7 is extremely fast. IMO Beats XP in many places.. Windows 7 is even BETTER looking than vista. I love it!; Price. So many versions!!!!
It really works with all my software.; DO NOT overclock the memory/cpu,it really HATED THAT!(10% caused blue screens at loading of logonui.exe)
Runs well on minimal systems. Slick functional interface. Far fewer problems, such as crashes and incompatibility.; A few programs still make the system crash and burn.
The ease of operations from software to hardware; none that I have ran into yet
Runs smoothl Fast, Easy to use, all around a good buy.; I havent found anything I dont like about it
Much better UI than previous versions of Windows. A lot lighter on its feet than Vista. Light years ahead of XP.; It makes me wish I had a touch screen monitor!
A face lift on Vista, that actually works. Great graphics. Improved speed and reliability. More driver support.; Not a complete redesign. Then again, so was XP :)
Fast when managing files even larger ones greater than 100 meg in size. Much more stable than Vista Ultimate. Easy to set up XP Virtual Machine. Nagging Task bar notifications are gone. Security notifications are much less intrusive.; None so far
Most (not all) of the things that were supposed to be in Vista. Less of those annoying security questions.; Haven't really found any!
fast on both old and new Pcs. Secure,reliable,smooth.. its just the best OS ever; i am addicted to this Operating System
Fast, easy to use and stable, what more could you ask for in an operating system?; Uh, it's not free?
it runs fine i tried it from a amd sempron 2800 to a amd dual-core 4800 1gig of ram to 4gigs of ram it runs very fast on all of them; it your listioning to music during installing something it well skip.
Blazing fast with 64 bit. Win7 compatability advisor didn't like my flatbed scanner and film scanner(both almost 10 years old). After a little tweaking both took off . Works great.; I like classic. Too glitzy. Made required set up changes.
Fast in starting, advise if a page etc isn't suitable. Never see the 'blue screen'; Can't think of anything to complain about-maybe the price could be a little
Much more stable, secure, intuitive, versatile, compact and quicker; Still not crazy about the lack of a bundled (and powerful) anti-virus and spyware program
Fast. Stable. nice features that I am just now learning; A little trouble finding the folders I want to save stuff in - I think I have to get used to it.
I like the improvement on the interface and performance.; I don't like the lake of drivers for the x64 platform.
runs fast,easy to use,has a great media center interface,allows better battery life on my laptop; some applications that worked with xp may not run with out XP Mode installed
I tried beta, then RC and just bought Final Version of Windows 7 Ultimate. It really rocks. Very Smooth, Faster, Secure &#38; Error Free.; Internet Explorer. It's the worst feature of Windows 7!
It is fast to use. No errors caused by windows (Had Windows 7 since November 2009) The Best system ever made. The XP Mode works great. The search is not slow at all (Like in Previous Versions). Real neat Sound Features. Internet connection is quick.; Nothing at all
Faster than XP!. More stable than anything out there!. Doesn't crash!. Looks great!. Makes my workday a breeze!. Very secure. Finally a 3 Pack for home users at a decent price.. Media streaming over the internet from my desktop to my netbook. Sweet!; Too many versions.
Easily upgrades from Vista. Excellent compatibility with every PC and peripheral I've used it with. The user interface is logically arranged and allows for customization at every level. Application program launching &#38; multi-tasking is very robust.; None worth mentioning
Sensible new aero features. Faster than all previous versions. Awesome device support. Never installed a single driver. Overall it even looks good :).; I feel not complete yet, experienced bad time where computer froze few occasions in 4 months of usage.
It Runs really smooth and rarely freezes. It also seems much quicker and more responsive than xp was. The new taskbar is the best ever!s; The 16GB footprint that it leaves.
new taskbar, memorizes my multi-monitor desktop set-up and resolution for both work AND home - vista would only remember the latest configuration, libraries, device stage, better mgmt of notification icons, jump lists; was hoping for a new UI
64 bit 7 uses less ram at idle than 32 bit vista does !. easy to navigate. ISO burner built in !; nothing so far but im sure i will find some eventually most new OS's have a few problems
Excellent speed, fast setup, non-intrusive, excellent new interface, great new media features, way more customization options, fast search &#38; indexing; The interface changes may take a little while to get used to, but once you get used to it it will be a pain to go back to vista or xp. Some libraries are hit-or-miss
- Family Pack is priced very reasonable.. - System Image backup is available in Home Prem and above which was not in Vista Home Prem.. - Homegroup is sweet. - Calculator has more features. - Problem step recorder is a very welcome added tool.; So far, there isn't anything I don't like.
Fast, reliable, easier to use, very cool look...just perfect finally Microsoft listened!!; My blackberry Javelin cannot be used as a bluetooth music manager which i did with vista but hope one of this days we will have compatibility again :)
-Performance(works on old hardware as well as XP). -Aesthetics (Glass Transparency is Gorgeous). -Superbar (Multi-Window Management). - Boot Time (30-40secs w/AV and misc programs); -Gadget Selection. -IE8 is decent but not a testament to MS. -Event Viewer needs to be more user friendly. -Price
Easy installation, drivers are so easy to install, average clean installation is 15 minutes, compare with 40 to 60 in XP.. I already installed 10 new installations and 3 upgrades.; I had twice Windows explorer freezes
The user interface is great , the themes are still awsome and now take up less resources, everyting is so easy to use......the taskbar is great, the multi window viewing is very nice; mmmmmm........honestly,......i havent found any con yet
- Stable. - Easy to use interface; - Nothing so far. An OS needs to provide a foundation for other software to run and Win 7 does just that. It's not a resource hog like Vista.
Many pros, see below for most of them. To sum it up, faster than vista, new aero features, and works with more 3rd party devices.; The only cons of Windows 7 are cons of windows itself... see below for more.
fun interface update, simple backwards compatibility, better security, and does not crash as often.; I still had a few issues with some old programs. I am guessing is because I am using the beta test version.
The deployment tools to deploy this OS have only gotten better. With SCCM and SQL Server we are nearly zero touch on deploying machine out of our IT depts.; driver conflicts here and there at release but they've been resolved by the hardware manufacturers.
Like it so far. Lots of coolness. Cool features,interface, and a return to common sense. Like the stripped down program with no heavy baggage.; No resident anti-virus software. Still early...
Easy to install. Taskbar and Aero Peek. Show desktop button at bottom right of taskbar. Huge driver support, and automatic installation of any driver you can think of. Multiple timezone clock. Great at connecting with wireless networks; Noticed some very rare lag which may be due to my system originally being built to handle Windows XP and Windows Disaster (aka Vista).
I though it's just New Windows Vista... I was wrong.. I started liking sit more and more front of my PC now. PC is nomore boring or irritating.. It will make you happy while working on PC. I never struggled for anything after getting installation.; I heard about performance of Office Products poor- However I never faced.
Better interface than in Vista, highly customizable and simpler; faster operation; better process control. Both Vista and XP seem outdated and not handy enough after Windows 7.; Individual programs do freeze sometimes but they always come back alive. Of course system requirements leave older XP compliant computers behind. That's essentially the only disadvantage I can think of.
This is not Vista, very stable, compatible, and easy to use. Microsoft definitely got this one right. :-) With 64 bit, it seems a tad speedier than 32 bit.; So far, no cons, but every OS is not infallible.
Great new features. Aero and Snap. Upgrade went very smooth. Didn't have much problem with Vista and almost didn't upgrade but after having it for couple days now very glad I did. Runs much smooooother.; Can't think of any.
Win7 64bit found drivers for all internal as well as external devices. I thought my scanner was going to be an issue, Win7 put up a yellow warning sign, but I found the Vista 64bit driver worked fine.; I haven't found any yet.
-Sleek and "shiny" interface. -Easy to navigate, all necessary shortcuts are within a seconds click. -Runs smoothly with little to no hang-time unless I load it with processes...; None as of yet...
Speed - boots up faster, and generally the UI seems more responsive to me.. UI - feels more polished.; None yet, although I've only been using it for a couple days so I'm sure something will come up.
Windows 7 is _______ than XP.. Faster. Better. Smaller. more Efficient. more Reliable. Easier. more Customizable. and much much more!; There are still 3-4 very small glitches in the Release Candidate, but the RTM will be devoid of issues.
Visually appealing, Smooth UI, Consideration to minor details, Less resource hungry than Vista.; Still not a good network connection manager included. New taskbar increases the access time of windows, and that seems to be slightly irritating.
Besides its look, it is almost nothing like vista. Its compatible with almost everything since it has XP mode that allows it to run old apps. Its sleeker and faster than Vista, and defiantly more stable and safer.; Nothing so far.
Simple, intuitive, thoughtful. I also like that it runs my direct x9 games with no problem..; Minor bugs, mostly with using Mediacenter and a couple of graphics artifacts on a menu once in a while.
The whole install take less than 1 hours. It took less than 10 minutes to get all the drivers install. Afterward the system run smoothly without any glitch. The systems run faster then a compatible clean install of Windows Vista.; Internet Explorer. The browser is incredibly slow. Many users, including myself, install Firefox right before even installing the drivers.
Way faster than the 64bit vista install i upgraded from, upgrade was completely seemless, just had to reenter some security credentials, no issues with any apps or peripherals, been an IT manager for 12 years and never seen an upgrade go like this; Upgrade process took almost 3 hours
Finally brings the aesthetics to Windows. Utilizes multiple cores (which were previously pretty much useless). Noticeably more efficient than Vista. Those who had to suffer through Vista won't need to re-learn yet another OS; XP users will need to adapt to the Windows 7 system (buttons/settings not where they are in XP). No quick launch bar readily available. Users of lower end systems will find efficiency returns disappointing
It is a lot faster than Vista, uses less resources, very stable, and well, just plain awesome. Boots faster, and well, what else can I say other than it is a huge improvement over Vista?; The new taskbar is cool, but it might take some getting used to. It can be changed sorta, but still!
intuitive even for a 9-year xp user. Instantly found drivers for 3-year old GeForce 7, card reader, and knew my monitor make and model. instant drivers ready for my HP Printer. Configs network in half the time with half the clicks of XP.; still easy to ignore UAC...
Not at all like Vista. This is what Vista should have been.; I am a pc gamer and I have yet to find any faults with Windows 7
Smooth, clean, neat features, faster smoother execution for most stuff, REALLY easy to use.; A little too easy to use for hobby geeks, and it's got a bit of a learning curve as far as getting used to the UI, although thats really not a criticism. Oh, but where's the Email program????
Aero Peek - awesome way to manage multiple windows. Better driver support - I no longer have problems with automatically switching between single and dual display when i connect my laptop.; Unless you're coming from Vista, you have to do a clean install. Which is a pain. Other than that, I've found no real problems with using Win7.
The polished look, the improved performance, the smaller hard drive footprint, faster boot and shutdown, faster sleep and resume, slightly easier to use.; The taskbar (The bar at the botttom of the screen with the Start button on it) has a really weird problem with program icons, I dislike the hold-your-mouse-over-the-program-icon-and-wait-until-the-minimenu-pops-up-then-select-the-window system.
Clean, smooth and fast. Works great with even older hardware. Redesigned taskbar, UI elements and Windows Aero are fantastic and fresh. Multi-touch works fantastically. Easier to use. Less unnecessary programs come bundled making 7 feel less "bloated"; Upgrade options are tough for XP users but still worth the effort.. Not many productivity apps out-of-the-box. Other than that, nearly-flawless.
Started converting a few laptops to the late beta version. Pug n Play worked perfectly in every instance. I was able to rely on the O/S to handle all the basics (no custom programs) for WiFi, Power, Sound, Bluetooth, or Printers. Wow! Well don MS!; Requires a reinstall of Windows, and no workable in place upgrade.
- jump lists. - driver support. - speed (tests may show differently, but if it doesn't FEEL faster to you, then something is wrong. - updated themes. - view, edit pictures faster. - connect to network drives faster; - didn't have the driver for my printer, but accepted my vista driver, so it wasn't that big of a deal
Ease of install / upgrade, Speed, Hardware compatibility and reliability and most of all, features! I give it a 4.5 due to the price.; Price is probably the one notable con to this software. I think its well worth the cost depending on your needs (i.e. small business). Too many platform options, 6 are a bit excessive.
Everything a Windows OS offers. Feels and looks great, but it actually is very practical at the same time. Exelent driver support; Still security issues.. Not sure if i will have to defrag and mantain the system for it to work optimally but till now it works like a charm.
It appears to have some of the features of XP, which I've missed terribly, something as minor as hibernation.. And it still has the appearence of the aero color scheme, and the cute little trick of switching between windows.; Now this question has 'futuristic ' aspects which will have to be answered in more detail later. Put it on my desk and I'm sure it will be much more welcome than my HP Pavilion Elite m9400t PC.
fastest install to date on my inspiron 1.8 ghz mobile, 1gb ram, built int vga..took 30 minutes to install from scratch, only missed two drivers which were instantly installed once I connected my USB wireless adapter...; Quite honestly, I have not found any yet..I have reloaded all the apps that were on it when it ran xp pro sp3...no issues so far...It scoured the lan, found all devices, networking is much easier than Vista, on par with xp. boot/shutdowns faster too
Fast. Stable. Reliable. User friendly. Significant improvements to just about everything. I love the new Taskbar, Aero interface and performance improvements. Programs that use multiple processors like Maya and After Effects noticably faster.; Why was RUN hidden by default? Media player 11 interface a tad obtuse. The way a window expands when you slam it into a corner is often annoying, especially if you want to line up multiple windows.
I have been using 7 RTM Ultimate for over a month and have had no problems with compatability or stability. Ease of use,perfomance,and over all new design features make it well worth the switch for home use and more inpotantly, business!; Wish it was released sooner.
Great reliability, performance and features. This version of windows destroys XP and is much more than just another version of Vista. I recommend the 64 bit version for newer computers and IT professionals; Perhaps, many applications still need to be optimized for windows 7; in term of using the jump list features. Otherwise, very compatible OS.
I experimented with Windows 7 Enterprise and it installed without any problems. All drivers loaded without the "!" icons in Device Manager. Boots faster than XP Home Edition. Netbook has 1 gb of RAM. Windows Experience score is 2.2.; Aero interface is not necessary. Security popups are not as annoying as before but they're still there.
Way too many to list, but the new auto resizing of windows when you drag them into either side of the screen is certainly something everyone with a larger monitor will beneft from. Faster startup, and usable immediately. No UAC annoyances. Many more.; I would have liked to have seen a dreamscene equivalent in Windows 7.
Windows 7 is fast enough to run on a netbook comfortably(win7pro), has no driver issues yet far. n. not as obnoxious as vista, takes up 1/3 of the ram that vista did.. But that is not 7.; None. except that you can't save files in the Program Files Directory, saving files wherever I like is usually what I do.
A breeze to install, automatic install of ALL device drivers, and able to run on a 5 year old PC and 3 year old laptop, without issues. STABLE, fast, pretty and very laptop friendly. Sleep mode works brilliantly. Libraries good idea. XP mode great!; Some of the "pretty" aspects of Vista have been removed inexplicably... Control Panel, for example, is white and bland - not sure how this fixed or improved anything? Aero "shake" utterly stupid. Homegroups, Media Center "movie library" half-baked.
The new Aero options are a nice touch.. The "Superbar" rather than the Task bar is nice.. Clean, and seems to run spectacular compared to my old Vista.; Some of the features could actually be used in ANY windows but they were pushed as "new" for advertisement purposes.
Multi-monitor support is fantastic. No more un-maximizing a window to drag... just grab the top move it over. Move mouse to top of screen and it maximizes automatically. Speed is incredible. The UI changes to the task bar are very helpful.; As with any new OS, driver support is not yet there. Within 3 months of RTM we ought to see this as a non issue.
Bigger, Faster, more complete. All that Apple has to offer and more ... Microsoft more than made up for the 'dump' they took with Vista. The most user friendly. New themes in the new"Personalization" make it the most handsome interface yet.; No Outlook Express. In the Control Panel, the' Programs and Features' will uninstall programs only, yet they name it like this. Why not beef it up, more or less like XP, and include repairs, troubleshooting programs as well as erasing programs?
Seems faster. I have used on a Fujitsu a6220 laptop and an AMD desktop, both 64bit systems. Shutdown is much faster and if IE freezes it resets itself after a pause.; Drivers not available for all hardware on the Fujitsu laptop with clean build, upgrade used drivers from Vista. Maybe that will be rectified after final release date?
The first thing you notice is the excellent boot time. Less time than XP, and hours ahead of Vista (sarcasm). Programs like OpenOffice that tend to take literally a minute to load on XP, load within 10 seconds on Windows 7.; The worst you have to deal with is finding the drivers for your soundcard.
Great intstallation for both 64 bit Vista, and 32 Bit XP machines. Great new features, and a lack of garbage features that doomed Vista. When you click on the Shut Down button.. guess what.. it shuts down..; I can't convert from a 32 bit XP to 64 bit Windows 7 by just purchacing an upgrade pack.
With windows 7, it blew vista right out of existence. It responds well. I have a top line high performance machine and it takes a whole lot to lock up and freeze. Windows 7 did more then just pass a standard test. It really lived up to its name.; It really didn't have any downs like we though it would, other than incompatible programs but it doesn't matter. It's our fault for using legacy software.
Jump List. Aero Peek. Faster startup boot than XP with the same apps starting up.. Taskbar pinning.. Remembering most often used app in start menu plus recently opened files. Design. Search is better than vista. Stable. User Friendly; Been using it for 6 months and no problems so far. My recommendation is to add a remember history for UAC (User Account Control) to avoid it when using your trusted applications. Although you can now customize UAC's level of notification.
I don't really care(my brain goes along with me) if it's not significantly faster than xp. The menu reaction and window instantiation feels instantaneous. Features like snap is truly a pleasure.; I'm sure for some people the new taskbar will be a bit off putting. I welcome it, it really is a better way to go.
Boot times, I was running vista before and now with 7 the boot times are impecable and just amzing speed, felt like I have a brand new Laptop.; Price very expensive... But the way I look at it, if you use something everyday of your life then this is worth it for sure...
Plays all my games, minus one, see the con for that. extremely fast, or as the review stated, percieved to be extremely fast. Have never found a USB device that it did not find, install, and ready to use within 30 seconds or less.; For some reason, I could never get Civilization IV or the expansions all the way to Beyond the Sword to load and run correctly. So, I bought the box set that includes all of the expansions for it in Steam, and everything runs fine. Listing as a con.
Fast start up, applications load fast too, helps you a lot if you require it.. I could go on and on about the many good things in it, but i'll just skip to the Cons.; Nothing! well, actually... the only thing I dislike is that (I have Win7 RTM &#38; RC) my WLAN was working fine on Win7 beta/RC, but on RTM, it doesn't work, so I have to use a internet cable...
I have Windows 7 Pro 64 bit and works really great! Easy to use and doesn't crash unexpectedly like you seen in XP &#38; Vista. Has a great compatibility mode that XP didn't have that allows you to use programs of older generations.; Takes a little bit to get used to after using XP &#38; Vista but is amazing after. And there's really no cons I have seen.
Generally faster than Vista, more robust and useful than XP. Best of both worlds for sure. Vista had a bad rap, thanks to particularly below the belt advertising by Mac, but has since rebounded with useful college kids buying computers.; Pricey!!! Going away from security UAC isn't the answer, they put it in because they had to and were basically doing what the consumers wanted. However, you can't have both, the robust dynamic easy to use system AND tight security with 95%target size
Windows 7 is the perfect mix of XP's functionality and Vista's style.. It works perfectly, is really quick and very secure.. Windows 7 is as cool as any Apple OS and retains the increased amount of options + tools that are revered by professionals.; The product does not have a good antivirus program included. I know that no OS does, but I think Microsoft should aquire a company like Symantec and automatically include the OS...i.e. if the regulators wouldn't step in...
Easy to install and didn't require the intensive user input that XP required. Works great and programs run faster than in WinXP on a 3 year old computer with 2 GB of memory!; Full price is a high but there are some deals on the internet for less than full price.
I love the new task bar, its much more appealing and less cluttered. My favorite feature is the simple installation. ALL of the drivers i needed for my computer were installed automatically. I didn't need to sit through any installations for drivers.; Internet Explorer need i say more, it's ultimately useless. So yes it is still as crappy as it always. I also had to download all printer drivers just for certified drivers for a common hp printer, bit of a pain. So i had to install one driver.
It has run every program I have thrown at it with out crashing or causing me issues, even my old XP ones. The taskbar makes using the operating system easy fast and fun. The 64 bit version works better than XP 64 hands down.; The colors and theme schemes that come with Vista are more vivid and colorful, next to Vista and dare I say XP the defaults themes are a bit bland, Missing the black Vista had.
Seems to never crash. I have it on several computers here and cannot remember a single crash. Well thought out GUI. Pleasant to look at. Improves on the NT family. Fantastic programmer / developer workstation.; There are cons? lol The one con is that Microsoft didn't do this sooner. My criticism is not of the OS but of the selling strategy: 'would have dispensed with the Enterprise and Ultimate versions and have rolled their few extra features into Pro.
This is the best product put out by Microsft. Windows 7 offers a lot of new and innovative features. Although the pricing is a little on the expensive side, it is worth every penny for the outstanding and awesome new features Microsoft has added.; Some things that could helped Windows 7 gain more popularity is a decrease in price. Compared to Mac OS X Snow Leopard, this is a over expensive product. There are not a lot of cons for Windows 7, since it offers a lot of new, useful features.
Very easy to use... perfect resource using especially the 64bit version on a quad core with 8 gigs of ram :) it has surpassed all expectations. Im using it to run a Virtual Servers and 3 other O.S. I have also used it on my dell mini 12. great also; none that i have found yet. other than 64bit compatibility issues which is to be expected.
The UI is absolutely beautiful. The ability to pin things to the taskbar is a fantastic addition that I have been using to my advantage (as well as the search function in the Start menu). Overall speed is greatly increased since XP.; To be quite honest, I'm not really sure if there's anything I don't like. Recently I have been using a few apps at a time with multiple windows and it is a bit of a nuisance trying to navigate between them but I'm sure I just have to explore the UI.
Worked well on various hardware, very well on new laptops. The look and feel is very "clean". No hang ups blue screens no driver issues (for us) very good layout. We will migrate from XP to 7. My production machine is win7 its this good im impressed; the layout has changed enough that will take getting used to but once you do I think most will find it very logical and so much better. Not a real con. There are a few things like creatin new connections that are a little out of the way.
