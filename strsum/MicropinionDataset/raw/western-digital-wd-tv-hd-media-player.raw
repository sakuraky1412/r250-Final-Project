Pros:. THe transfer is very fast and the picture is AWESOME!. 
Cons:. IT does not read everything.. 
Summary:. Compared to the other 5 on the market this is the 2nd Cheapest in terms of monies But it pack's one Heck of a punch! Great sound and picture! Great Valentines day gift for your Movie buff!. 

$$;
Pros:. Has input for two Hard drives, plays almost anything. 
Cons:. No Ethernet, Slight learning curve. 
Summary:. This is one of the best things I have bought in I don't know how long. I wanted to archive my DVD collection on hard drive so I began with that. Then I started looking for ways to play them on my TV and I ran into this device. I was surprised at how good this unit is for the low price that it is sold for. I have two WD My Book 1 TB Hard drives connected to it and I have my collection converted to .mkv files. They play great. There are other functions I would like, but for the price this unit is more than you could really ask for!. 

$$;
Pros:. plays a lot of files. 
Cons:. no network connection. 

$$;
Pros:. Massive file support!. 
Cons:. No Ethernet!. 
Summary:. you got me at file support! HDMI and Optical! Sweet!. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a great device that enables you to watch movies from the thumb drive of this device. Set up was a snap. Once I got the hardware out of the box it took no more than a minute to set up. The on-screen menu is simple and easy to interact with.. 
Cons:. Spent more time tracking down this media player in the store then setting up the device. It's not well know.. 
Summary:. For the price of $110 this is a great product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, compact, good looking box. Totally silent (no fans). Excellent picture quality. Works with all of my files.. 
Cons:. - JPG picture viewer is very slow. - tracks not listed in order in mp3 albums. - icons are all the same - doesnt show first frame in movies etc.. 
Summary:. Cant go wrong with this. I was getting tired of burning CDs and DVDs to play AVI files in my DIVX-enabled DVD player. This is the perfect solution for me - stick the files on my 4gb thumb drive, plug it in and watch away.... The small size is perfect for my set up too - fits in the little space I have in my rack.. I only wish it had a front USB port - I have to trail a USB extension cable out the back of the device to attach my thumb drive too.. An SD slot would have been nice too, but not a big deal, since SD-&gt;USB converters can be had for $1.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Easy set-up and play. 2. Simple interface. 3. Plays all types of video/music/picture files. 4. HDMI connectivity/1080p capable.. 5. Price.. 
Cons:. Does tend to get hot.... 
Summary:. This is simply a fantastic device which I have been waiting for some time. I own several external drives and it works with each, whether simple flash or an encased aged seagate. Currently I combined the WDTV with a WDPassport 500gig, it works without hiccups, fast and specially without additional plugs to the wall.. I have a very large library of ditigal media that with the WDTv, 1) saves me money -no need to buy and rip dvds,cds etc and 2) saves a vast amount of space. Also, I have an older HDTv without HDMI, all I needed to do was hook it up with a HDMI to DVI cable and RCA plugs for the sound. To me its similar to an IPOD video without all of the proprietary software. You will need to update the driver to play all types of files but this too is simple. Enjoy!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. dont have to have my kids DVD's laying around anymore.. 
Cons:. none right now. 
Summary:. I use this with a 500gb WD Passport that I have ripped about 50 dvds on so far. Hook up the HDMI and your in business!. 

$$;
Pros:. Multiple format playback.. Easy interface. Very simple, yet elegant menus. 
Cons:. This device does just what it says. It is easy to use and has no defects.. 
Summary:. This device does exactly what I hoped it would. It makes music and movie playback via your home entertainment system, a breeze. It is simple to setup and can be used for SD TVs as well as HD TVs. Most media extenders do not support the older TVs. The remote is simple and small and has a lot of power as it relates to it's range and angle.. 

$$;
Pros:. ?	Easy setup. ?	Excellent quality. ?	Plays H.264 and MKV movie formats without conversion. ?	Relatively inexpensive. 
Cons:. ?	No built in Hard Drive. ?	Have to physically move the external hard drive back and forth from you computer to your Home Theater System to download movies. ?	Stays warm in standby mode. ?	No HDMI Cable included. ?	Small remote contol. 
Summary:. If you download movies especially H.264 or MKV formats this little box plays them with no conversion and avoids the need to burn them to a dvd or blu-ray disk. You load the file on an external hard drive plug the external hard drive into the WD TV which hooks to your TV or home theater through an HDMI cable, or composite cables if you must, and you are good to go. The setup is as simple as it comes.. While it does show photos and play music to be honest I didn't buy it for that purpose and have not tried those features.. I have the WD TV hooked to my Home Theater System which has a projector with 1080i output and a 100 inch screen. The quality of the video and audio output is excellent, essentially the highest quality you can get on 1080i, virtually blu-ray quality. The WD TV is also easily upgradeable with downloads from Western Digitals website.. The WD TV is relatively cheap for what it does. Bottom line this is a great little box.. 

$$;
Pros:. Conveniently separates and lists all media files I downloaded or just saved on my portable external hard drive eliminating the need to burn CD's or DVD's.. 
Cons:. Doesn't read all media formats, so you need to be careful when you save files.. 
Summary:. Have had mine for over a year now and think it's a great addition to my entertainment center. . .two friends of mine went and bought one as soon as they saw how convenient this media player is.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays tons of formats, including the elusive MKV, smoothly at high resolutions. Modding is simple enough as well, which led to being able to read my ext2 HDDs, customizing the menu and backgrounds, and expanding the capabilities of this little gem.. 
Cons:. The biggest issue I had was trying to find a another remote for this thing. The tiny remote is very easy for children and wives to lose in the couch. I went to Meijer near by and got a $20 Philips remote that has learning capabilities. Problem fixed.. 
Summary:. Out of the box, this media player is a little clunky and flawed, but if you update to the latest firmware from WD, 98% of the issues are fixed. If you are like me and have to have support for something the factory firmware doesn't support, you can void the warranty and install a custom firmware, and allowed me to use my ext2/ext3 formatted external hard drives. It's quite simple and very safe. There has been very few video formats that I have not been able to play, and my favorite being MKV, is supported (for anime, I know, I'm a loser). You truly can't go wrong with this, unless you HAVE to go with a proprietary standard, such as WMV, which this little guy will always say no to, and could be a problem that some people here are having problems with but aren't reading the manual. As far as audio, I don't do much listening through my WDTV, since I like to listen to it on the go, but it does play many formats flawlessly, just in case you like to do so. I haven't tried viewing any pictures, but that is also why I have a digital picture frame. You can't go wrong with this little beast. Slap a couple terabytes of hard drive space loaded with AVI rips and MKVs that you have "found", and you'll be happy, just remember to make sure that you update the firmware as soon as you open the box or you may have some issues that are mentioned in other reviews (aside from those not being able to play unsupported codecs).. As for the firmware, I went with B-Rad's WDLXTV firmware, which adds tons of cool stuff. Note though, you can also damage your player if you are careless or mess with anything you have no experience in, such as advanced settings and other cool "high-level" Linux stuff. As usual, modding can void your warranty, and with any mods you do, no warranty is implied, enforced, or provided. Use at your own risk, should you go down that path.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Video format support.. 2. HDMI connectivity.. 3. Size.. 4. 1080p capable.. 5. Price.. 
Cons:. Can be quirky at times, needs to be restarted.. 
Summary:. I have been waiting for a video player with the long list of features to hit the market for my bedroom TV set for a very long time (I use an HTPC for my main TV). WD fits the bill quite nicely. It plays almost anything you throw at it, has HDMI and 1080p support and plays .ISOs (dvd disc images). I even take it in my minivan to use on the long trips. It had some problems at first, but WD is constantly working on improving the box and fixing all the known bugs. Did I mention the price? There are other alternatives on the market from a less known companies, but they're a lot more expansive. WD is one of my favorite hard drive companies and now they have another outstanding product on their hands.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) Easy setup and play. 2) Since there is no built in drive, no fear of becoming obsolete in storage. 3) Plays most formats -audio, video and photo with very good quality. 4) Compact in size. 5) WORTH the Money spent. 
Cons:. 1) No proper product promotion and manual. 2) Does not use the playlist in HD recorded movies. Each movie clip need to be played separately.. 3) The unit I brought required firmware upgrade to play ".mts" files (the file format in AVCHD cameras).. 
Summary:. It is a useful HD media player especially when there are very limited players available in the market to play HD clips (I think IOmega Screenplay PRO HD is the other available one). I have a HD TV and HD camera. Always the camera need to be connected and the files are to be copied to camera SD to playback and it is a hassle.. Even though i could not confirm about its capability to play .mts files before buying (Neither the product box nor the WD web page does not list this format), it did with some initial hitch. I had to rename the .mts files to .m2ts files (!!!). Later i upgraded the firmware and it worked without problem.. Then I had to struggle with remote to play each HD clip separately ( 1 or 2 min duration each). I got a solution. The .mts files can be combined using a free software Tsmuxer (try http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/tsMuxeR-Download-92743.html). AND NOW I have an excellent device to playback the HD clips. In addition you can use your HD TV to play back high res. photos. Hence, it makes the HD camera, digital still camera and your mp3 collections more useful and meaningful (Enjoy.!!!) at relatively low cost (around US$120/- in middle east) when compared to the HD gadgets (I mentioned earlier) we possess.. 

$$;
Pros:. it is small, slick, plays just about anything and in good quality, easy to take on trip, finally non-PC product that also supports NTFS, easy of use, quite handy (despite few shortcommings), firmware updates are simple affair.. 
Cons:. i's like file browsing like Norton Commander -&gt; show file names and size (bunch, not just one), HDD is always on (player is off), cannot hide/turn off unwanted categories, no eSATA or Eth. revind too slow(2x,4x,8x,16x instead of 2x 8x 32x 128x).. 
Summary:. it is a nice product for unbeatable price and I use it a lot. i would be more than happy to see the cons sorted out (most can be done through firmware), and i would be ready to spend more to get that functionality. combined with quiet external 2.5" drive it is welcome addition when on vacation or business trip.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love having a system to watch my avi files on my TV. Two USB connections. HDMI connection available (but cable not included). Small, sleek unit; doesn't take up much space.. 
Cons:. Remote is terrible. In most cases, can take upwards of 15-20 seconds for one entry on the keypad to register. Makes searching for specific files tedious. Small remote with few functions.A letter keypad would be nice. The search function is laborious.. 
Summary:. Overall, I really like this unit. I love having a way to watch my avi files on my 42" TV. However, I'd be lying if I said it didn't come with some frustrations. The remote is so frustrating because it is very slow. Each press on the keypad can take 15 or more seconds before you can make the next entry. When your only search capability is to enter letters on a virtual keyboard, this is maddening. More functionality and zip on the remote is a must!!!. The unit was almost non-functioning right out of the box. I thought I'd be returning it to the store. But once I made the firmware updates, things really turned around. Now, it's just the remote functions that are the big drawback.. Also, the user manual comes on an included CD. When I loaded this in my laptop, I got a warning message from my anti-spyware software (Lavasoft Ad-Aware) that I should not continue - that the content posed a significant security risk. So I aborted that. Therefore, no manual. Good thing my needs and desires from the unit are simple: Play my avi files. That, I can figure out on my own.. The price was fair but it does vary from seller to seller. I've seen it advertised from $99 to $129 Cdn. Shop around. But only buy from a place with a good return policy as I wouldn't trust every unit to perform perfectly. I'd want the option of exchanging it or returning it, if I were you.. All told, I give this unit a 4 out of 5. I like everything about it, EXCEPT the remote. WD HAS to address these issues and hopefully this will be done on the next round of firmware updates. Although when I gave them "new buyer" feedback about the slowness of the remote, they claimed this was NOT typical (other users' opinions agree with me) and I should make sure the WD "isn't too close to the TV because some TVs will leak infrared radiation that can interfere with the WDTV from receiving commands from the remote." However, they don't say what is "too close". Mine is 2 feet from the TV. I'm sure most people would place theirs the same distance away.. Bottom Line: Buy this unit. You'll love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent interface. Easy setup. It's just a really simple way to sit on the couch and enjoy media files on the HDTV.. 
Cons:. A lot of files (*.jpg and *.avi) that should run without conversion, need to be run through the MediaConverter software. I never had a problem once I ran files through the software. File access is a little slow.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays ALMOST anything.. no HDD. 
Cons:. Will need WD Firmware to be perfect. no Real Video RMVB support. 
Summary:. It's true this is a very good player for the money though it does have buggy issues as many have reported. Too bad western digital has not released a firmware version yet to fix these problems. once they do this will be a hard to beat player since it can do ALMOST everything you would want it to do. Seems there are two types now: with and w/o hard drive. those with HDD like the Mediagate or Popcorn hour are a good choice. those w/o hard drives like the WD TV, IOMEGA Screenplay are good too but you have to attach some sort of external usb storage anyway. So choose wisely. If you are looking for something that may be better than the WD TV, search for this: "Mediagate MG-M2TV". this is the newest player from Mediagate which can do everything the WD TV can but actually supports more formats like RMVB (real video) for many Asian videos. so this is one item i'm really looking forward to. hoping the reviews are good on this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. I could be wrong but who actually likes the idea of having thier computer ON so they can stream content to their TV?--I think the vast majority of people prefer the easy no fuss method. Some of us don't have big bucks like the whiny Cnet reviewers.. 
Cons:. "Networking capabilities" waay overated--I'm very confident making this statement.. 
Summary:. Love the product--this is what i've been waiting for.--I'm sold.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Inexpensive (For what it can do the WD TV player is surprising cheap). 2. Compact size (It is about as big as a 500gb drive). 3. Playable Formats (Plays most formats of audio, video and pictures). 4. Conversion software included in package. 
Cons:. 1. Will not play files perviously converted to .wmv by a different program.. 2. The device can have problems reconizing other brands of hard drives. 3. The device can't view .pdf or .ogm files. 
Summary:. Despite it few limitations the WD TV HD Media Player is a ideal device for playing back recorded media without having to rely on a computer. It's compact design make easy to carry from place to place and it easy set up makes it great for parties or family gatherings. It can have two hard drives plugged in at one time and plays most formats flawlessly. I brought one after my computers crashed and its been a godsend by allowing to access to all my family movies, music and photos stored on my hard drives.. 

$$;
Pros:. * Plays most formats. * Easy to use. * Easy set-up. * Nice interface. * Looks good on my HD TV. * Software is updated by WD to add and improve features. 
Cons:. * Some AVI files will not play. * .MKV support is sketchy. * Fails to respond to remote on occasion. 
Summary:. I bought this device out of a desire to watch some of my videos on my TV rather than my computer.. Set-up is easy. Plug it into your tv, plug-in a usb drive and it works.. I have had some problem with the remote not responding, this is easily fixed by unplugging the device and plugging it in.. Some .mkv and .avi files haven't worked, I merely use a third party converter for those.. All in all though, it does what I need it to do and Western Digital keeps updating it.. I'm pretty pleased with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1.Excellent Video Upscale quality even in fast action sequences. 2.Plays all format. 3.Compatible with all type of Hard Drives and Audio/Video Formats. 4.Size. 
Cons:. 1Remote operated only n remote develop snag,keep scrolling after pressing arrow button 2.Hangs whn player switches on,2 solve this press no button when player is detecting USB drive. 3Only fast forward option available cant jump scenes in single file. 
Summary:. Great Product, high on usability got minor drawbacks but its the best in its class, I got both Iomega and WD and its far ahead.. 

$$;
Pros:. WD TV HD Media Player is a good buy barring a few issues. To start with, I am able to play HD 1080p videos on my Sony Bravia KDL-60EX70. Fine that I can effectively transfer my video files to my Sony without a hitch.. 
Cons:. We decided for a wireless and started looking for a Wireless N router. Luckily, a friend mentioned that router should be in the approval list of WD or it won?t work. It does not have an inbuilt adapter too.. 
Summary:. It also plays all the latest video formats too including H.264 and X.264. Happy that it has a Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS audio support. Unfortunately, we could not enjoy it because it is not in sync with the picture most of the times. The menu is not as simple as it should be. I was told that it has a blu-ray quality, which I am yet to see.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, perfect for travelling. Plays almost everything, including SRT subtitles, and connects via HDMI or Component video.. 
Cons:. USB ALSWAYS ON.. take care, the 2 usb ports remains ON after you power off the device. I have 2 external and broken hard drives due the fact is always on.. and the device becomes a little warm after a while, even off.. 
Summary:. great cost benefit, but do not expect new firmwares or support from the manufactur.. 

$$;
Pros:. pleaseeeeee top urgent we need to read the translation with arabic format because it appear with bad language when we play English films. please update us what we can do please. 
Cons:. nothing ..... just my last memo. please solve it for me and allot off my friends. it seem that we must enter some codecs or something. 
Summary:. Updated. on Feb 28, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap and plays just about everything, much like the popcorn. 
Cons:. Lacks DTS decoding. Lacks Networking. Could have been like EG-M34A priced alike but like popcorn. 
Summary:. Cheap HD player which plays most of the thinsg i throw at it.. Now that Egreat has come up with EG-M34A (see egreathd.com), which is essentially a popcorn a-110, at sub USD140, this WD TV deal could loose it appeal.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, looks neat and probably very quiet. 
Cons:. can buy and xbox 360 which does the same for a bit more � and also a games machine! can plug in any fat32 formatted usb drives.. the xbox does make more noise tho...... 

$$;
Pros:. - Small form factor. - Easy to use and to navigate. - able to recognize different media file formats. 
Cons:. - at risk of overheating, unit does not comes with a cooling fan. - no on device controls. - able to handle different media files formats with flaw (no audio in some case). - interface need some work, picture quality is so so. - performance issues. 
Summary:. Let me tell just give you some pearls by saying one thing right at the get go - "DON'T BUY IT". I got this media player about 6 months ago, while there were not many choices out there. It is simple to understand why WD wanted to get this one out of the gate so fast, well the product wasn't ready. A few things swing to mind that bothers me about this product.. 1) It got the job done but with glitches, it plays most of the movies but some got audio only and some got video only.. 2) You immediately got stressed when find out if you lost the remote, you will be out of luck since there is no on device control buttons.. 3) Heat, lots of heat! given the size of the device, you will how they handle the cooling issue, well, the answer is there are none. No fan of any sort whatsoever, once the device is overheat, you will notice the performance will take a hit, or your house is on fire.. The bottom-line is, we are going to see a very furious competition regarding media set top box such as Apple TV, google tv and Boxess, wait a little and let the dust settled, then you will for sure get the most bang for your bucks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, handy. If it supports your files, it works OK.. 
Cons:. Doesn't play neither my TIFF picture-files nor my AVI video-files - even thougt both formats are listed on the box. Apparently it only play some kinds of these files. Unfortunately this is what I bougth it for, so I feel a bit cheated.. 
Summary:. If you want to avoid disappointments, you must dig deep into file-types, read the manual and browse the support-forum (http://community.wdc.com/) before you buy. Things are always not what the seem here.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Capability of playing CD-quality sound files (FLAC) to hi-fi RCA connectors. - Full-HD TV playback through HDMI. - Easy firmware updates. - Playing from any USB drive. 
Cons:. - cumbersome organization of files. - not continuous playing of sound files. 
Summary:. The WD-TV can play a large number of video and audio formats, from any USB drive. It has 2 USB connectors, so it is convenient to have a hard disc permanently attached to it, and left the other free for playing from a pen drive. I have read that you can plug an USB hub, but I have not tested whether it works. What convinced me to buy the WD-TV was its capability to play FLAC files, i.e. lossless sound files, since then I could rip all my CD collection and listen to them in CD quality trough my hifi system. Moreover it has a hdmi connection, and I could also see movies on my HD-ready TV. In fact it can play full-HD files, I would like to be able to use this feature in the future.. The quality of both image and sound is good (not audiophile, but excellent for the price). The design is elegant and the size is very convenient. The menu is simple to use. The big problem is the organization of the files, since when you have a large number of them is rather cumbersome. You can select music files by album, by artist, or navigate on the folders of your hard disc. But to select an album you have to find it between all your albums in alphabetical order, regardless the artist. If you have a large number (easy in a 500 GB drive) this is a hard task. If you select by artist, you find all the songs by that artist in alphabetical order, so mixing all the albums. It will be more convenient to find albums by that artist, in order to select one to play!. Other problem, which should be easily solved in a firmware update, is that there is no option to play continuously (i.e. without gaps in sound) sound files from an album. This is awful when listening to certain albums or to live recordings.. Of the video files I used for testing the unit, roughly one third played without problems, other third played without sound, and the other third didn't play at all. When I updated the firmware, those without sound then played without problems. Those not playing continued to not play. The unit came with a conversion software which I have not tested yet, I hope this will permit to convert these files into a compatible format, but I cannot confirm it.. In conclusion, if in a future firmware update WD solves these issues, the WDTV would be an excellent player of all types of media files. But for the moment it is not. Before buying this unit, I would recommend checking the release notes of the last released firmware version (which you can find in the WD web page) in order to check whether all these issues have been actually solved. If yes, then the firmware update is very very easy (simply copy the file in a USB pendrive and plug it into the WD-TV).. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works properly this product has a great interface reads nearly every video format is compact &#38; easy to use &#38; set up.. 
Cons:. The device hangs. Is to hot even when in standy it also keeps the power running to the external HD in standy mode &#38; needs to be turned off at the power socket after every use. The maximum working room temperature is 35C to low especially in summer.. 
Summary:. I originally set the WD TV up using a HDMI switch using 1.3 cables to my Sony Bravia KDL-40X2000. The interface hung 1 in every 3 boots (it would go to save screen mode after a while but the remote never responded until switching the device off &#38; on at the wall socket). I then did some trouble shooting &#38; dedicated the device to each HDMI port swapping numereous HDMI cables &#38; updating the firmware but the problem only worsend to working about 1 in every 15 boots. This was all extremely frustrating to say the least. I went back to the store &#38; swapped WD TV 3 times &#38; continued the trouble shooting but had the same issue on all devices. I came to the conclusion that it could be one of three issues... a HDMI issue with the WD TV, the TV was not recognising the WD TV properly, or I just got a bad batch. Every other device I have connected to the TV works without fault including my Pioneers DV-410S with has DivX operational thru a USB port to external HD.. I was extremely disapointed as I like the product but feel it has been released to early &#38; requires a load more tests &#38; updates. I have read forums from other people with similar but not identical HDMI issues to mine. I beleive there may be a known error with the HDMI. I also read about a possible HDCP certified issue that may be causing these problems on some TV's.. The composite worked well even on my mother in laws 18 year old telly using a scart to composite converson box.. I ended up purchasing a Mediagate MG-450HD I have been testing it since yesterday &#38; it runs very well but does not accepts slightly less media formats.. 

$$;
Pros:. Will decode most formats, Inexpensive, small plug-play very simple.. 
Cons:. Using mkv's, mp3 and mv4 you will see video stutter or jerkiness. Most video's you may not noticed but if there is burst of video data it has to process then you see stutter. Usually when camera pans on scenery or an abundant pixel changes.. 
Summary:. They're no longer responding to these complaints on their forum. I speculate that it is not correctable from firmware and is a limitation of processing power of their video decoder. This is because there haven't been any more firmware updates for just under a year. This tells me from a business perspective they maybe coming up with a better design in the future and would never admit to under powered video processor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, sleek, simple.. 
Cons:. I bought this to display slideshow photos to friends and relatives. The unit is supposed to be able to display pics at 3 second intervals but it won't. It takes between 7 and 14 seconds. This is unacceptable and WD was not helpful.. 
Summary:. When I found out that the unit was taking between 7 and 14 seconds to display my slideshow photos instead of the 3 seconds that it is supposed to, I went through a lot of time-consuming trouble to send it back to WD. You must fill out forms on-line and get an RMA number, box it carefully, print the RMA form on 3 sides, ship it to the depot at your expense, and wait. That's after communicating by email with their tech-support for a few days. Eventually I got a replacement which operated no better than the original. When I called about a refund they said to call the store where I bought it on-line. They didn't return the original box I shipped it to them in, so Tiger Direct will likely not accept it. I have several WD external drives, and I like them, but this unit just won't do what they say it should.... and my photos aren't huge files. They are bigger than most, but even WD says they should present no problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. Support is awful and it doesnt work with my 1.5TB drive. 
Summary:. I bought this device after hearing good things but my own experience was awful. I connected it to my 1.5TB Seagate hard drive when it had about 800GB worth of video on it and it worked, albeit slow at first. When you first connect it up, it chugged doing "something" and took 1/2 hour before you could actually use it because it needs to cache what data you have on your drive. It also needed to use 5GB of my drive to write this info. Anyways! Afterwards, it worked fine but soon after copying more information to it (1.2TB in total), I ran into serious problems! It no longer could see the drive. Not sure why, I contacted WD support. The technician told me to run their hard drive test tool. I ran it and waited the 18 hours for it to run. It passed the test just fine. I told the technician but he told me to replace the drive because it was bad! I reiterated that it passed the test, not failed and that it was a Seagate drive as well. He told me that they only suport WD drives! If you think being treated like this is good, then by all means buy this crappy product!. 

$$;
Pros:. N/A. I was unable to use the product.. 
Cons:. I have seen other reports about problems with the remote control. It is cheaply made. If you have a universal remote, I strongly recommend that you program it to control this device.. 
Summary:. I expect something to work when I get it.. Dealing with WD has been an endless source of frustration. More than 2 months have passed, and I am still waiting for a replacement..
