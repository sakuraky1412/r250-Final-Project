first of all , do not get the silver colored camera go for a colored model  .

if you notice a demo camera at a store that is silver , it has a lot of rust and fingerprint problems on the body  .

the colored ones protect against this the silver one in raw metal  .

secondly , get a case , sony or other , that has a lengthwise flat , preferably magnetic , not velcro  .

the reason why is you want to be able to open the camera case with one hand  .

this let's you cradle the camera with your other hand safety  .

if you can get your camera safely in and out of the case quickly , you will use it more  .

great camera  .

you cannot get something better for this price .

i am 'that mom' who always has a camera  .

i'm no professional photographer by any stretch , but i do document everything my family of 8 does before discovering this camera , i is torn between wanting a very expensive nikon with all the bells and whistles that would also take hd video but is too big and valuable to lug around with me    or just any old point    and    shoot that would fit in my purse my husband discovered the sony dsc    w290 in a black friday ad last week  .

we read up on it and the more we learned , the more impressed we were , so went and checked it out in a retail store  .

needless to say , we bought it on the spot  .

not only did we get a phenomenal price by buying it that day , we brought home a 'toy' that has brought us tremendous entertainment this past week  .

i cannot say i've ever enjoyed a camera so much the face detection , face recognition and smile detection were all features i thought would be cute but i'd never use  .

i is wrong    i don't know how i ever lived without them as for the hd video , which is a huge selling point for me , i simply cannot say enough about how impressed i am  .

the day after i bought the camera , i took it to the nutcracker with me and made crystal clear highly zoomed    in video from the back row of the balcony  .

i could not have been any farther away from the action    yet it still made this video   http  //www  .

youtube  .

com/watch  .

v  h_hy1fq_jky  .

please note    this is my first day with the camera , i is still trying out features  .

i also didn't watch the show through the lcd display    i is watching it on stage and not paying much attention to my recording    so i did a very poor job of keeping the camera still and centered  .

by the way , you can watch it on youtube in hd if your computer can handle it  .

if it skips when you watch it , it's not the video quality  .

also notice how decent the sound is on my video , considering my location and bearing in mind that this is filmed in a very old middle school auditorium for the record , i still haven't read the manual  .

the camera is so easy to use and everything is truly self    explanatory  .

the menus and modes are clearly identified and easy to navigate this camera is just right for a huge percentage of the general population  .

you can set it on easy mode for simplified shooting , iauto mode for automatic use of several great features , or , if you're a more advanced user , you can adjust the settings yourself do not let the sweet , simple look fool you    this baby packs powerful potential  .

i am thrilled with my early christmas gift  .

it replaced a fuji s1500 (great camera , takes excellent pictures , makes very good video , too bulky for dragging with me everywhere) and an olympus stylus 760 (okay camera , decent pictures , very convenient for taking along everywhere , minimally acceptable results in movie mode    better than having no video at all  .

we are delighted with this find  .

the pro's far outweight the cons  .

we have told everyone about it and cannot imagine anyone wanting to buy any other camera updated  .

on dec 4 , 2009  .

i really like this camera , it still works after i dropped it but the lens cap doesn't work well now i really like it for video when i do not have my hd camcorder with me because this camera does 720p pretty well  .

if you would like to see an example of what it can do for video check out my blog here    .

very nice camera for the price , good pics .

so far , i love it  .

hope sony keeps up their quility  .

have an older version of sonys digital camera  .

i've had for 15 years and it take a kicking and keeps on ticking thanks , cnet and you too sony , jt  .

this is a great camera  .

i compared it to the cannon 880 when shopping and for the price you get a lot more features from the w290  .

hd movie and smile detection are some of my favorites , plus you can put face selection/ reconition on people you take pictures of a lot  .

it's really cool  .

i love the camera and would recommed it to anyone .

i just like the features as well as taking nice clear photos  .

the movie feature is really nice , too  .

the only thing i did is buy an 8g card so i could take a lot of pictures or do a lengthy amount of filming    that works for me  .

like many compacts , you cannot zoom whilst taking video , but this aside , i cannot fault this camera in any other way  .

it seems to be the perfect balance between performance and price , and well worth the asking price  .

if you get one of these , you wo not be disappointed .

the camera is a amazing camera if you want to get one that can catch amazing images , although it is not sony's proclaimed top of the line one (w300) it has better zoom , records high def video , has all of the same scene features , it just lacks that titanium coating that protects it from scratches , although honestly i have never ever gotten a scratch on any one of my sony cybershot cameras , i had a older w80 camera and it broke after i hit on the wall and floor when i fell on vacation , even when i did that it doesn't have a single scratch it just broke the lcd which is why i bought this new camera  .

so really this is better that the w300 , the only thing it lacks is the coating that does nothing , and those 2 more megapixels which chances are aren't even noticeable difference  .

the one thing i hate about this camera is that if you break the lcd screen , i do not think that you would wish to pay $100 to replace it , so buying a warranty is highly advised if your a active photographer  .

the accessories are cool but are over priced for just going out and buying them so they would be more for a special occasion because they range from $50    $200+  .

but overall if you are in need of upgrading a camera or buying a new one , the sony w290 is right for your wallet and it will blow you away in quality and features  .

also i forgot to talk about the battery , the charger works around the world , although it has a united states 120v plug with the two long prongs coming out , somehow it automatically detects that it is in a 220v outlet or other voltage and changes it and allows you to charge your battery like normal , all you would be needing is a converter so no transformer is necessary  .

so this makes this an added feature that makes it great for travelers also  .

this is an easy to carry camera for travelers that dont want the big slr bag pictures are excellent except those requiring a long range flash  .

a hand held slave flash will solve that problem  .

much better then the canon powershot sd790 is i had before .

nothing to dislike  .

overall , this is one of the best cameras for the price  .

it has more features than the elph , and at a cheaper price  .

the price + sony + features   best camera .

lovely over all .

q  sony+cyber    shot+dsc    w290 and you will find best discounts .

all in all , a very impressive camera , especially compared with models with lower video capability , and slightly lower resolution , but cost is greater or equal  .

it has great feel , and is very intuitive  .

works seamlessly with mac osx , iphoto and imovie  .

i highly recommend this camera .

so , bottom line , it is a great camera in its category , but needs for higher zoom and better low light situation force me to upgrade to something else like a panasonic zs3 12x or canon sx200 12 x  .

this is only because of what i am using it for , not because of it performance  .

great family pictures , great concert pictures when not taken too close .

good buy for the price category  .

overall a great camera for the cost  .

it sucks that you have to pay additional for a camera case and a memory card though .

good camera for the low price if you do not plan to view the videos in windows photo gallery .

i took loads of photo's in both the auto mode and the scene mode ; neither produced the quality i is expecting  .

camera fired up quickly , and photo's in large lcd screen looked great  .

however , after loading them into laptop phot's were very disappointing .

love cnet reviews ; but do not agree with the w290  .

i tested/lived with sony w290 and canon sd960  .

both 12mp with same chip size ; wide    angle , 720p video and compact  .

i tested each camera and combed various camera websites and compared pictures at 100% crop  .

see digitalcamerareview  .

com and steves    digicams  .

com the canon sd960 wins with sharper pictures , better colors and 16  9 screen picture quality  .

accurate colors ; though i prefer the slight oversaturation seen with canon cameras giving subjects more life  .

macro is good ; however when pixel peeking at 100% crop the pictures are a little blurred with flowers looking painted  .

the canon sd960 if life    like with fine detail and textures   bad indoor daytime pictures   .

w290 has very poor shutter speed  .

if the camera moves a little or the subject moves ; the picture will be very blurred/useless  .

taking birthday pictures of my kids is impossible  .

even with forced flash i could not get the subject to freeze still came out with blurred moving subjects  .

my friends sd880 took great pictures video great for on    the    go 720p videos ; prefer my sony cx    12 for videos  .

the digital zoom does work during record (not optical) so the image gets grainy past 2x zoom  .

one great thing is that the macro adjusts during record so that focusing is an active process  .

sd960 focuses once when the shutter is pressed , but will not adjust focus (on macro) during that clip bottom line  .

cnet is right about most things ; but not the w290 best camera get a canon sd880 because 10mp has less noise inherent to these new 12mp cameras , has wide    angle (very useful) and all the reivew across the internet rave about the sd880 if 720p video is what you want as well , get the sd960  .

also has wide    angle , slightly less noise (digic iv processor) , great pictures (color/sharpness) and sports a 16  9 monitor  .

with hd plasma , computer monitors , camcorders all moving toward 16  9 , i would not be suprised if cameras slowly moved this direction i happily returned the w290 and am very satisfied with canon sd960 richard  .

wish i'd hung on and bought a canon  .

i is extremely disappointed in this camera as most sonys i have ever had were great  .

do not buy this camera if you are looking for consistent pictures or plan on taking many indoors .

this is the first time i strayed from a canon  .

it is a mistake and i am exchanging it .

having had several canon cameras , i thought i would give this sony a try based upon cnet's review  .

it may be great for video , but very poor for a camera  .

i'd probably give nikon a try , but am now afraid of wasting more money , going back to canon ; much better camera  .

i am surprised of the poor quality of the pictures taken with this camera  .

i changed the settings trying to get better pictures out of it , but it seems that it has a poor design  .

most pictures are noisy or blurry  .

it is a big disappointment for me , since i had a dsc s75 camera which is very good for a 3 megapixels camera .

i'm so disappointed with this camera  .

i have children who actually move ( go figure)  .

this camera does not produce a clear image unless the subject is completely still and in a well lit area  .

it's just ashame  .

the camera is a gift from my husband and we bought it from the army exchange catalog  .

for us there are no returns .

it seems sony has given the least priority to image quality which in my opinion is the most important factor i bought this camera a week back , and today i am done packing it back in the box ready to be sent back the images are grainy and lacks detail because of heavy and poor quality noise reduction done to them , even at iso 80 i had bought a memory card mc pro duo , which i will have to sell somewhere because i cannot use that anywhere else  .

i tried all the settings really hoping for a decent quality shot , because i had spent money in memory card , case , card reader , etc , but not at all satisfied  .

so even with the loss of the accessories i have to return this camera , and will not buy a sony again  .

i have finalized my next order which would be the panasonic zs3/tz7  .

its ironic if you see the editor's rating comparing the panasonic and the sony .
