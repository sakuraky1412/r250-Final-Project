$$;
Pros:. Slim and easy to carry. Nice colour. Never had a problem with it.. Easy to entirely reformat if you want another file system.. 
Cons:. I wish there was a 1T version.. 
Summary:. So much better than the WD "My Passport"! It has no virtual CD so you can use it any way you like.. 

$$;
Pros:. My son is 2 and he loves electronics, he has plugged it into every socket you could imagine. The worst part he used it as a bath toy, It was not discovered for 30 minutes in the tub w/him. I let it dry out and it worked perfect after about 2 days!. 
Cons:. I really don't have any Con's about this product. More problems with my Toshiba Laptop then the seagate hard drive.. 
Summary:. I bought this product a year ago. I am thrilled to have it for back ups and to put all my large projects, movies, and music on. It really was built to last. I think this is the best piece of equipment I have ever bought for my computer. BAR-NONE!. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought the 500GB PC version for under $100 on sale at Best Buy. Plugged it into my 250GB MacBook Pro and Time Machine immediately and automatically reformatted the drive and did a complete backup in under 10 min. So far, fantastic product.. 
Cons:. People have complained about the short USB cord. This is a backup drive for me, so I don't care about this.. 
Summary:. What a price. Silent, doesn't over-heat. Weighs less than my 1st gen iPhone. Would definitely recommend, as long as it doesn't crash or die:-). 

$$;
Pros:. PC version works on Mac with reformatting of drive. Cheaper than the Mac version and still works great! Goes well with Apple's Aluminum Keyboard.. 
Cons:. Reformatting needed, default format can not be used by Macs.. 
Summary:. If you're on an serious budget and need an nice external drive for your Mac, buy this!. 

$$;
Pros:. Relatively good $/gb ratio, doesn't require an AC adapter, fast, and great design and form factor. 
Cons:. When is Seagate going to make a 1+ TB freeagent go?! Otherwise, NO cons!!. 
Summary:. If you need or want extra memory, I highly recommend this drive. I still own the Seagate Freeagent Go that I bought two years ago, so I've had a good experience with Seagate products in the past. Recently, I needed more memory for my music and video files, so I did not hesitate to buy the latest Freeagent Go model. The new design is gorgeous and small. The performance and speed is fantastic, and the software is very handy (though I rarely use it). You can customize the drive to auto-play music or video, auto-load your picture-viewing software, or open windows explorer to view the files, etc. You can't go wrong with this external hard drive!! Don't hesitate to email or post any questions.. 

$$;
Pros:. This drive is small! I have an older Seagate portable drive , and this one is literally half as thick. The size/weight of my older drive was the main reason I didn't travel with it, but this one is going in my bag.. 
Cons:. The drive is still a 5400-rpm drive, as most if not all of the portable USB drives are. Would like to see them come out with 7200-rpm drives as well.. 
Summary:. If you're looking for an excellent portable drive to have your drive &#38; file backups on the go, this is it. The optional dock accessory is a nice touch as well.. One thing to note - the USB cord that came with my drive (500gb) is not short like the CNET reviewer pointed out. The cord that shipped with my drive is at least a foot long, if not longer. For a portable drive, I don't see why you'd want anything longer than that.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's small, it's cheap and the fact that it looks pretty attractive is not bad either.. 
Cons:. -short usb cord. 
Summary:. I like this product simply because it works, and it works well. The 5 year product coverage is also nice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Surprisingly fast through USB2. Very small and light. Universal good looks.. 
Cons:. Stainless steel finish scratched out of box. No Firewire 800 unless you buy "Mac Compatible" version.. 
Summary:. This is a great drive that IS Mac compatible (with disk utility &#38; reformat). Works with Time Machine and is fast enough for large video/audio transfers. Best of all its very thin and light.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Sleek Design and available in many colors (though some colors can only be gotten with certain sizes...why I don't know but it is the way it is). It also has a great price per gigabyte.. 
Cons:. The software in my opinion is very bad. If your folders are configured in a certain way it will not allow you to sync them. Also the USB cord is VERY SHORT (1ft. 5 5/8 in. long...This sound long but trust me, it can be very inconvenient). 
Summary:. Even though the software is not the best and the short USB can be aggravating at times I WOULD still recommend this to everyone. I love my Freeagent Go and never leave home without it. I happened to have some extra room in my Freeagent so decided to put some of my favorite Portable Apps including Firefox Portable, Portable Sudoku and a mobile media player (for the media on the drive). So i really suggest giving this drive a try :) Happy Researching. 

$$;
Pros:. the street price is much more competitive than full retail shows.supplied sw is worth the price when competitors have none.. 
Cons:. look at file system. 
Summary:. review the detailed capabilities of the software that allows you to control your data storage and control automaticbackup and built in security. street price for 160 gb model is 59 dollars. CNET evaluators only considered hw capability did not explain sw in their valulatio .poor job.. 

$$;
Pros:. +Slim form factor. +Decent transfer rates for a 5400 RPM USB2 drive. +Cheap storage. +Optional dock really adds to the looks and help clear the desk of wires. +Completely silent and heat free.. 
Cons:. -Activity lights are useless, however pretty they may be.. -Crappy software that came with the drive backed up about 3/4ths of the songs and documents that I have.. -Crappy software also only backs up My Documents on Windows machines.. 
Summary:. Looks/Form: 9/10. Perhaps the greatest reason to buy this particular hard drive. It's slim and small, barely bigger in any dimension compared to an iPhone. It was nice for SG to keep the same curves that the original go had, while updating the style with Apple's ideologies in mind. The dock just makes it look that much better. The lights are a nice sight, especially in the dark. They can be turned off.. Performance: 8/10. Speed was on par with my buddy's 320gb WD passport and 250gb Simpletech wedge thing. Transports things fast enough for a 2.5in drive, but I've seen better. However, what sets this drive apart from the passport is how bloody silent it is, not a single peep from this drive...The case is also stone cold after a few hours of transferring large files back and forth. While they may be a nice sight to look at, the activity lights are a bit hard to read. They go from dim to slightly brighter. The threshold between these two states of activity are too subtle to tell what's going on; but no matter, not a deal breaker for me. It's NTFS, so format it mac owners, don't go buying that more expensive mac version (*** is up with that, 30 dollars extra to format it in fat32?). Packaged Software: 4/10. Honestly, you can make a nice simple looking interface just like the one that this drive comes with, but what good is it if it misses a bunch of files? Even after updating the software, it still dropped files like it had butterfingers. If I hadn't checked the log, I probably would have lost about 500MB of songs and a few sensitive documents the next time I do a clean wipe of my computer. Get another backup utility, this is rubbish.. Optional Accessories: 7.5/10. I got my drive at costco, which meant it also came with the case and optional dock. Nice deal imo. These accessories won't factor into my score. The dock makes the HD look awfully nice while the case is a nice and cushy (p)leather material. While the dock is just simply a USB2.0 A to B connector attached to an aluminum platform, I still like it and think it's a worthy accessory to own. The HD isn't a finger magnet like the passport, but it can still scratch up. The case looks up to the task for protecting the drive. You don't need these accessories at all.. Overall: 8/10. Great drive, seagate really delivered with this portable external. By far the sleekest looking drive outside of building your own enclosure of course. Performance is above average when factoring in heat and sound. It would definitely make a good stocking stuffer. Just make sure to replace that weak bundled software that comes with it. Recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its sleek and easy to use during mobility.. 
Cons:. Sofware maintenance and the solution for it. 
Summary:. Dear Experts,. During the data copy,system(external hard disk) abruptly stopped.then i Removed the hard disk and plug in then system(Laptop) say unable to find the software for the USB device.. Even though i had loaded the segate manage software,system unable to find the software for the segate.. Please help me out and s there any way to recover my data from it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of hard drive space, easily personalizable.. 
Cons:. Unreliable company, expensive, quit working.. 
Summary:. I bought this external hard drive for a backup hard drive when I had computer troubles about 7 months ago. Last week it wouldn't work. I plugged it in and it wouldn't do anything but beep. I contacted Seagate and they told me I should have backed it up. Let me repeat. BACK UP MY BACK UP HARD DRIVE. This seems like a vicious circle to me. So I contacted their sister company that does recovery and they want anywhere from $1000 to $3000 to recover it. I COULD HAVE BOUGHT A BACKUP COMPUTER FOR THAT KIND OF MONEY! I am a college student and a composer and all of my scores and music were on that drive. So now because of some cheapskate company I am out all of my compositions and possibly my career as a composer. If you think you need something backed up just buy a new computer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast speeds. Very low price. Only 69.00 at Wal-Mart for the 250gb version.. 
Cons:. The unit just felt too delicate for me. The casing is so thin, that I felt that I had to baby it too much. It's definitely not durable enough to serve as an everyday drive that you can bring with you.. 
Summary:. I would not recommend this drive if you want to actually use it as a portable drive. If you want to sit it on your desk and never move it... it would be perfect. But, isn't the point of an external hard drive to be able to take it places and take your data with you? It just does not stand up to that kind of use. I brought mine back after 2 days, because the casing was delaminating. I just felt that it was a poorly constructed device and not worth my 70 dollars.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great form factor. 
Cons:. It died in 6 months. I was sent a "repaired/reconditioned" unit as my warranty replacement. That's just unsatisfactory.. 
Summary:. Don't buy this drive if you value your data. Like playing Russian Roulette.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet; slim; excellent price, given the storage capacity of the drive.. 
Cons:. This drive crashed after only three months of minimal use.. 
Summary:. This drive was seldom used, never dropped and rarely moved, nevertheless after three months of use, the drive abruptly stopped worked. Seagate could offer little assistance and had no explanation for this error. My product is still under warranty so they will replace the drive, however, I must pay for data recovery. Seagate?s response, ?next time, backup your data.?. I have seen numerous accounts on the internet account detailing this type of crash, however, Seagate will not acknowledge this problem. I cannot recommend this product.. Note: Seagate refers users to i365 for data recovery. Expect to pay at least $1200 for this service. If your product is under warranty and you would like to make use of another licensed data recovery service, you must provide written proof that the drive case was opened for this purpose in order to receive a replacement product from Seagate.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice, small, did the job. 
Cons:. data became inaccessible after about 1 year of daily use; seems to be filing system failure, rather than hardware; i WAS able to get all data off, after $130 purchase of Seagate recovery application!. 

$$;
Pros:. None, as this one gives nightmares.. 
Cons:. UNRELIABLE. 
Summary:. The Drive used for nearly one month for regular use. The essential Data was backed up onto this drive before formating my computer's HDD. Suddenly one day after connecting it to the desktop it did not show under the explorer, however, the drive name as Seagate Freeagent is shown in USB connections. I have ten different softwares developed on it and suddenly I am in a fix. Very unreliable USB External Drive. I am wary of replacing the Drive as I will forego the data and labour on developing the same and at the same time will not be compensated by Seagate for the same. How to recover all the Data of almost 100 GB !!! That will cost me a huge amount of money, and surely much much more than what the drive costs. One more interesting thing, the Drive shows a size of 2.2 TB without any free space in Seagate Manager. I am really in a fix because the entire softwares were used in my organisation where I work. FUNNY thing is that, if it is being used as a backup tell me do I need to procure another one for backing the data I had on this one and so on....... Please someone tell me what went wrong with this drive and is there any means to recover it????. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to use backup software. Small and very convenient to carry.. 
Cons:. The unit died after 6 months. Seagate's support is abysmal.. 
Summary:. I loved this product until a few days ago. The drive died and when I contacted Seagate I figured out why they can sell them so cheaply. They make up their money in support. I first tried to reach them through their "preferred" method, live chat with technical support on their site. After waiting 30 minutes for a response (during business hours) I disconnected and called them.. I explained to the woman on the phone what had happened and she asked if I'd like to try to see if someone in technical support could help retrieve my data. I said, "yes." She then explained that the cost would be $15 to SPEAK to technical support. I told her no thank you. Just replace my drive. She then gives me the option of returning the drive using my own packing materials and waiting 2-4 weeks for a new drive or spending $19.95 to have them ship me a new drive first and use their materials to return it.. I'm seeing my story repeated on reviews all over the net and I don't want another Seagate drive. Can someone tell me who makes a RELIABLE portable drive?. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, attractive, reasonable price. 
Cons:. Piece of crap, poor customer support. 
Summary:. Product stopped working after less than 2 months. Limited warranty doesn't cover them helping me get my data back off it and if I try to have someone recover the data, my warranty is completely void. Piece of crap product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap!!!!!!!. 
Cons:. Cheap!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. Worked fine for 3 months, used it for music storage... used maybe a dozen times putting new music on it or using to put new songs on MP3 player. All of a sudden started getting messages that it is not working, not being recognized by the PC. Sometimes not recognized at all, then would see it as an E drive, but no folders, then other times could see folders but no files within... I researched Seagate's website for HOURS... they need to have a website just for this product/issue. I finally had enough and opened a 'ticket' with their support group. I asked ONE single, simple question... I had seen so many posts for same issue, but several different solutions... I asked IF use of a Y cable could very well solve the problem.... I got an email giving me links to the same self tshooting website and of course, I365 link in case I wanted to spend upto $4500/day for them to recover my files... Seems the desire to offer a good product to the market place was not the intent here, but rather the creation of a whle new profit center within Seagate, I365 data recovery... NO I would not recommend this product and NO it was not dropped and NO it was never opened.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have a terabite drive... worked well for 3 or 4 months.. 
Cons:. Now the drive has developed a clicking noise, and wont run files smoothly. I bought it to back up files while overseas, now that I have taken it outside the US, I cannot get the warrenty fulfilled.. 
Summary:. I cannot reccomend this product to anyone. I bought it at the University bookstore and believed the packaging that it was a quality product... planned obsolecense? This is blantant disreguard for customer satasfaction that is suprising even for a hardware company. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM SEAGATE!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. the colors. 
Cons:. if you drop it lightly it will never work again, avoid buying this. 
Summary:. This product sucks and I droped it while i was sitting and it never worked again and the warranty is don't really work.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was great while it lasted.. 
Cons:. I expect my hardware to last longer. Poor value for such a short duration.. 
Summary:. I shall not buy a Seagate again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim/sleek design, good transfer speeds, and non problems for the first 3 months of use.. 
Cons:. Short USB cord, HD died after 3 months of use. 
Summary:. After 3 months of use, the HD unexpectedly crashed/died, and now I'm left with a $100 paperweight, and Seagate won't even acknowledge there is a problem (even though this is far from an isolated incident-there are endless forum posts with people with the same exact problem). Seagate won't replace it since the case was opened, and they won't pay for data recovery (though, they will provide it for a $500-3000 fee).. Bottom line, this product was great until it crashed. But the fact is, it DID crash, and I'm not the only one to have this problem, and Seagate is unwilling to admit that there is something defective with this product. You're better off spending your money on a more reliable product, and losing out on the design and aesthetic advantages.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was great, until it fell from the desk.. 
Cons:. The drives are simply to delicate to be used as a portable device.. 
Summary:. It was great, until it fell from the desk. The drives are simply to delicate to be used as a portable device. The housing in minimized to make the product smaller but it is not enough to protect it from damage. Using them as "portable" almost insures they will be vulnerable to some bumps and bruises. Do not rely on this product as a backup. One small drop and they die. Mine lasted 2 weeks.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim. that's about it.. 
Cons:. the external completely died on me out of no where after about 7 months. seagate's warranty doesn't cover data recovery and they start their cost at $399!!. 
Summary:. I am very very dissatisfied with this product. I bought this product less than a year ago to use as extra storage. So i stored data on their that I did not store anywhere else. I tried all the troubleshooting methods and none of them worked. I talked to a seagate agent about the issue and they took forever to respond. All in all, they forwarded me to the data recovery website where I contacted another agent. The base cost of data recovery is $399 and can go up to as much as $2500!! I think it's ridiculous to even charge that much. I'm very upset about how unreliable this product is. I do not recommend it at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. The one thing that I liked was that it did hold data.. 
Cons:. What i didn't like is that it shuts off every 5 seconds and then quits working completely after about 5 months.. 
Summary:. If you are going to get one you better go ahead and get 5. So that you can back up the backup the backup etc..... 

$$;
Pros:. great design and compatibility with my mac. 
Cons:. it suddenly failed after 7 months. luckily, i was able to recover my files however i can no longer trust this product.. 
Summary:. it suddenly died in just 7 months without any reason at all. it was never dropped nor exposed t any heat and humidity. i can no longer trust this product and therefore wouldn't recommend at all. it's cheaper compared to others however i don't think it would be practical if it fails sooner than expected.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap price, big storage. NOT WORTH IT.. 
Cons:. You will lose ALL of your files. The Customer Service will say TOO BAD. They will not help you at all. They will also deny this happens.. 
Summary:. I've had a Seagate Free Agent Pro for about a year and have experienced complete meltdown for the second time now. I woke this morning to the computer telling me it could not read the external hard drive and would like to know if I want to initialize it. The last time this happened, the rep asked me if I shook the hard drive. What? Why would I shake the thing? Better yet, why do they this sell crap on the shelves that potentially will destroy all your data? The guy said there is a possibility that the data can be recovered...at my cost. Why should I have to pay for the poor performance of this crappy device? I realize, again, that I should not rely on an external hard drive for storage, but I WILL NEVER BUY A SEAGATE AGAIN!!! This is ridiculous. STOP SELLING US CRAP SEAGATE!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. didn't work long enough to say anything good. 
Cons:. Seldom used....all was well until it completely went dead in a little less than a year.. 

$$;
Pros:. - The one big con outweighs anything else.. - The warranty. 
Cons:. - Failed unpredictably and suddenly. Seems to be a known and common problem.. 
Summary:. I bought two drives. Stored office data, software downloads etc on one (critical), and music and videos on the other.. The one with the music and videos has stopped working within a month of purchase. Don't know the trigger / cause. Just stopped working one day.. Seems like a power failure as the drive light keeps flashing on and off. Lost all data. Also lost trust in the product. Have backed the other drive up onto a WD drive. Unlikely to use it again. Lost all data. Also lost trust in the product. Have backed the other drive up onto a WD drive. Unlikely to buy Seagate products in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. small form factor. 
Cons:. unit did not work on XP or Linux using NTFS. 
Summary:. A waste of money... I'm glad we can return it..
