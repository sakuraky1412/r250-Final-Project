this hotel has a perfect central location with lots of bars and restaurants around it .
i think all credit needs to go the general manager , the rooms are of a high quality , very clean and the staff always smile , are positive with a nothing too much trouble attitude , the breakfasts are brilliant and the total service from this hotel from top to bottom is five star .
on arrival the reception is busy , but the staff are excellent and make sure that you do n't wait too long .
with offices in manchester this was my third stay at this hotel , i had an executive room , number 1203 on the 12th floor .
the room was perfect with two complimentary bottles of water per day , the room is modern with all the facilities you need .
the housekeeping staff look after you well , i left a note asking for feather pillows and that 's exactly what i got , thank you housekeeping , i also enjoyed the animal that was made out of the bathroom pillows , very clever .
the breakfasts are very good indeed and just what you need to start a busy day ; freshly squeezed juices which always spells quality , a selection of pastries , hot foods and fruits , if you need anything else they will get it for you .
i thought the service was also great .
i am returning again on the 30 december with my family , i had a chat with the concierge as i have . . .

i am sure that i will have many more wonderful stays at this hotel .
