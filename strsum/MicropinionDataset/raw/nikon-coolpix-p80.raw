Pros:. Great Colors, excellent large prints, easy to use, pre-programed modes are perfect, ISO 64. Excellent image stabilization.. 
Cons:. Uses Nikon Lithium Ion Battery instead of AA's. Does not have RAW Image format, no lens accessories available or recommended by Nikon. 
Summary:. Old school basics still apply in the digital world. Use the lowest possible ISO to get the job done. I don't ever remember in the film world being happy with any picture taken with the best of film over ISO 200. The same still applies in the digital world and I've seen problems with every brand of camera over ISO 200. With digital you have the advantage of getting great software to hide the flaws of pictures over ISO 200.. I have tried every super zoom camera in the same price range as the Nikon and the Nikon has been the most over all impressive to me. It's a durable camera that is designed to be easy to use. Software version 1.1 solved most of the "slow" problems with this camera and it's right on target with every other brand. It seems to have less distortion at 18X than most other brands and wow the colors are great! If you are looking for a camera that will work good most of the time in a wide range of areas this should do very good for you...

Pros:. Wow!did not expect such clean shot! And Pic quality!EvenD60and higher cam. can?t do that!Uwill not achieve the same shot!Unless U spend at least $800.00 just for lines!NikonP80 cost about $400.00there is no better camera in the world for this price!. 
Cons:. Cons: Need more light, Small Flash. However, You should count all facts! I was sitting on my chair! Did not want to move My b..! If I get up and try to do the pic again it will be Perfect quality!. 
Summary:. Nikon P80 cost about $400.00 there is no better camera in the world for this price!. AND please all other Reviewers! When you right about camera please mention what lenses are you using! Thanks!. 

$$;
Pros:. 18x zoom, perfect picture quality, compact. 
Cons:. noisy at high ISO, but curable. 
Summary:. I haven't used SLR cameras, but if I must compare to point-and-shoot I have owned, this camera is amazing. VR works perfect even at maximal zoom. Images are clear and with natural colors. It's compact and not expensive compared to what you get. Pictures are noisy at high ISOs, but there is wonderful possibility to limit ISO range. I have made many wonderful pictures and I'm very satisfied with this camera. Recommend this camera to everybody who wants more than simple point'n'shoot, but not ready for SLR.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Great pictures. Great in low light. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet.. 
Summary:. I'm no professional by any means, but I love this camera. It goes way beyond your average point and shoot digital. I get GREAT photos in less than stellar lighting conditions (my main concern in a digital cameral). I didn't want the cumbersome weight/size of an SLR, and granted, this is a bit larger and heavier than your average drop-in-your-pocket digital, but it's worth it. Video is also great compared to other digitals I've owned. For the non-professional who wants more from a digital camera, this is the answer. Only reason I didn't give it a 10 is I'm not sure what perfect actually is, but this is as close to it as I can imagine.. 

$$;
Pros:. 18x Zoom, image quality, lots of features, good image stabilization, pop-up flash. 
Cons:. Above ISO 400 it gets a little noisy, sluggish performance at times, longer then 8 sec exposure. 
Summary:. I think this is a great camera for the money. In good lighting it takes amazing photos. At night, when using higher ISO, it may get noisy depending on how high you go.. 

$$;
Pros:. 18X Zoom! Fast clear picutures. 
Cons:. No Raw Would prefer AA rechargeables.. 
Summary:. I finally upgraded my Olympus 4 mega pixel 10X zoom camera. I really like Olympus cameras and have purchased several lately for gifts (compact 6-7 mega pixels). So when it came time to upgrade my 10X zoom, I expected to get another Olympus. But after reading reviews and checking out the pros and cons, I opted for this Nikon P80 and am VERY satisfied. The "zoom factor" for a camera in this price range is far more than expected and the quality has been excellent. I haven't tried all the features yet, but so far, so great. I would highly recommend this camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. long zoom lens, vibration reduction, large lcd (2.7 inch), small size camera body. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I have had this camera for 2 days now, and I could be happier. It beats the Canon S3 IS and S5 IS, the Olympus SP 560 and 570, and the Panasonic FZ18. I have done extensive research on all of these models, and tried them all at a store. I took a gamble and went with this new nikon model and i love the speed, picture quality, and the super fast zoom lens. The VR is extremely effective when i am taking pictures of my kids in their sports leagues. I can't put this camera down!!. 

$$;
Pros:. 18x zoom. Sports setting. 
Cons:. would like to be able to add other lens. 
Summary:. I love this camera. My children bought it for me for Christmas, 2008. After 3 mos, it exhibited problems--I'd turn it on, the lens comes out, snaps a picture, afterwhich none of the buttons work. If I turn it off/back on again, same thing. I get some great pictures this way, but I can't use the zoom, which is why I wanted the camera. It ended up "fixing itself"...and worked well until last month, same problem. Now looking for someone who can repair because it doesn't seem to be fixing itself this time.. When I had full functionally--loved it. The sports mode captured some great shots of my granddaughter swimming in swim meets and of my grandson playing basketball. With the zoom, I also got some great shots of the full moon.. 

$$;
Pros:. It seems to have about every feature available in point and shoot camera.. It has a great feel and is a joy to use.. Great zoom lens seems to satisfy most every shooting situation. 
Cons:. Does not have raw photo option.. 
Summary:. Most of the negative comments I have read about this camera were either from people who normally review DSLR cameras or did not take the time to properly adjust the setting options of the camera. The consistent complaint is that there is a lot of noise on high ISO settings, but I have not taken photos yet that had a high ISO setting.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature packed. 
Cons:. It not $200 ??? Just kidding. Have not found a con yet.. 
Summary:. I wanted a compact camera with super-telephoto and SLR features that I could always have with me. My D70 with all its lenses and accessories isnt always practical. I wanted the ability to shoot video too. On the first day of use I shot a couple of portraits of two of my grandchildren that were just amazing. I have had the camera for about 2 weeks now and am fairly familiar with it. There are still a few features that I need some more practice with, but my favorite feature is the preprogrammed scene modes. If you are looking for a camera that will do most everything well, check this one out. I would highly recommend that you get an extra battery if you plan to do lots of shooting especially with the speedlight (flash.) It wont replace my D70, but since I will always have a quality camera with me I wont miss that shot either.. 

$$;
Pros:. extensive feature set, huge zoom range, generally very good to excellent image quality, operational flexibility. 
Cons:. very noisy above ISO 200, no RAW file format, somewhat sluggish performance. 
Summary:. I think the expert review on this web site is actually fairly accurate and well-balanced, and frankly better than most of the other expert reviews on this camera. A lot of people coming from digital SLR's have posted reviews on the Web that criticize this camera because of its relative lack of speed and somewhat noisy images, but it is a little bit ridiculous to compare any of the so-called ultra zooms to any digital SLR on those points. Admittedly, the camera could be faster, and I have disabled ISO above 200 because it is frankly virtually unusable. It bugs me that they don't allow you the in-camera editing features on full-size images, which seems to defeat the whole purpose of being able to do red-eye correction, image cropping and other editing tools within the camera itself.. On the other hand, the cameras feature set is so intuitive that I was able to access virtually every feature without consulting the manual. People need to remember that ultra zooms as a class are always going to have some fairly significant intrinsic trade-offs between absolute image quality and flexibility of being able to go from wide-angle and fairly extreme zoom ranges without having the inconvenience of switching lenses and without the enormous bulk of a digital SLR and two (very expensive!) large lens kits. I do think Nikon probably should have done a better job making the camera a bit more responsive, as it just takes too long sometimes to get a shot off. And I'm completely baffled as to why they included editing features that you can't use most of the time. however I have to say that the images that I have gotten so far have been consistently good to excellent including some very fine macro images, an area where Nikon has always excelled. If you keep some of these trade-offs in mind, and you're not looking for digital SLR levels of performance and low noise at higher ISO speeds, this camera will not to be a disappointment (snooty reviews on the Web to the contrary). It packs a lot in a very small container, and frankly gives you a lot for your money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast zooming, lots of pixels. 
Cons:. Sports action in bright light makes streaks. 
Summary:. Got the first one at Best Buy and after 2 weeks it started displaying white streaks on the vu-finder. Returned it and got a replacement from Best Buy, no questions asked. The replacement has worked great with no problems. They must have been working out the bugs in the first batch. The zoom is super fast. The sports action mode has some problems in bright light in that it makes over exposed streaks on the pictures, but in dim light it works well. Was able to take pictures of pitches crossing the plate in a local baseball game and actually see the ball in successive shots as it moved closer to the plate! I've had the Nikon 5700 and 8700 in the past, and like the features of the P80 better. Just wish they would have kept CF memory and the same battery as the 5700 and 8700 so I didn't need to buy new batteries, chargers and memory cards, sigh... I ended up getting extra batteries, chargers and memory on e-bay and PriceGrabber for good prices. Overall, an excellent camera, the sports action setting needs a little improvement in bright light situations.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10.1MP, 18x Zoom, Amazing Image quality, Large LCD, Manual A,S,P,M Modes for SLR control, Nice ISO range, great in low light, great on camera editing features like d-lighting, small, built well, SDHC. 
Cons:. Doesn't shoot in RAW(only con for some), a little too big to fit in pockets, flash isnt amazing at times, only take 13fps at 3mp not 10mp, not really cons, just wish had a little more. 
Summary:. I own a Nikon d40x, and D300 and this is an amazing back up camera. It takes as great shots as my d40x does, sometimes haha. I would recommend this to anyone just starting out, if you it's your first camera or as a backup, you will not be disappointed at all. It takes amazingly clear shots and at 10MP you can blow up your shots poster size...it has a great video function, manual modes for up to 8" long exposures. The LCD is bright, clear and accurate. The long lens range and 18x zoom along with macro function lets you get some great shots you would not be able to with any other coolpix or canon SD series camera. This is an excellent camera, the only thing I wish it had was RAW, I love shooting in RAW, but that's just me. This would be a 10\10 if it had RAW and if you could expose for more than 8 seconds, but hey for 400$ its practically as nice as an 800$ d40x!!!! Buy this camera, you will not be let down.. 

$$;
Pros:. The camera is easy to handle, takes sharp clear pictures and images transfer easily to PhotoStudio or PhotoShop Elements. I do not experience the noise and other defects others seem to find in the camera.. 
Cons:. The camera is rated at 18x zoom, yet it does not take a clear image (let alone sharp) at the same distance as my Nikon Coolpix 8800. I took a picture from my back porch of a sitting Osprey hawk with both cameras. The 8800 took a far better picture.. 
Summary:. I am very satisfied with all aspects of the camera - except - the deficiency in the zoom capability as compared to the Coolpix 8800 which has a rating of 10x zoom as compared to the P80 which has a rating of 18x. Shouldn't it take clear pictures at nearly twice the distance? The picture I took of a hawk at full focal length with the P80 was neither as clear nor as large as the picture I took of the hawk on the same limb of the same tree from the same back porch with the Coolpix 8800.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good and easy to use megazoom, great for pictures outdoors -specially daylight. Significant amount of functionalities, relatively friendly user interface. Very god battery life, battery recharge in fair time.. 
Cons:. The P80 has trouble understanding indoors light environments, specially with flash. In these situations it becomes extremely difficult to focus specially if you zoom.. The camera has a slow performance in between shots. 
Summary:. In general P-80 is great outdoors, and it 18x zoom works well. It has plenty of functionalities. The camera has a slow performance -- but the major issue is definitely the P-80 difficulty on understanding indoors light environments, specially with flash. In these situations it becomes extremely difficult to focus specially if you zoom. 

$$;
Pros:. good telephoto. 
Cons:. slow, no raw, some what large for a point and shoot. 
Summary:. I just bought a point and shoot for my grandson. After looking at a couple of cameras, the sales person showed me this model. We discussed it and I had to agree that it was not as good as the other models I had looked at and the price was higher. So I opted for another Nikon camera. I have had no actual experience with this camera; I just did not like its features and price. I normally use a Nikon D200. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice to have an 18x zoom, but pictures are best when using a tripod, color is true.. 
Cons:. Too slow, pictures look "digital". I have a 4 year old Dimage that takes far superior pictures. I had this camera for 3 days and returned it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Still looking. The lens may be a positive feature, but... I'll look some more. 
Cons:. Washed out highlights -- washed out entire areas under bright lights, e.g. sun.. 
Summary:. The review of the Nikon P80 notes the digital noise, the slow processing, (even on the fastest read/write memory chip I have, I still found it to be slow,) etc.. The most disappointing aspect of the camera is the washed out pictures--not only highlights, but entire well lit areas. I have fiddled with the menu to try to get better renditions, to some inprovement.. It is ironic, I got the camera because of its manual, shutter and apperture priority features, but the best pics I have gotten were obtained using its point-and-shoot option.. Truly disappointig!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good stitch program for panoramic with several shots. 
Cons:. When sports mode on, the camera made sporadic noisies &#38; vivration. 
Summary:. One of the main reasons I bought this was the sports mode. But I have to return after using two days. Whenever I dial to the sporst mode, I felt the continual shaking &#38; dull sounds. It was not worth to keep over $399.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge 24X zoom, not bad pictures if you take them in daylight or stronger interior fluorescent lighting.altho sometimes even then it doesn't like it.. Good macro and great wide angle.... 
Cons:. Terrible low light performance, I mean absolutely mediocre low light performance. I shouldn't have to compare a 5 year old HP PhotoSmart camera with a 1 year old 10MP Nikon.. 
Summary:. There is one major fault among the smaller noise issues etc, It's really bad at focusing in lower light conditions like in a loungeroom with 60 watt lighting and lamps. In comparison my family's old HP PhotoSmart camera is able to autofocus more often, I'm even able to say my Nokia N73 3.2MP cameraphone can consistantly focus on subjects in low light. I won't be buying another Nikon Coolpix camera again! I wasn't able to take photo's of my little sisters graduation and I shouldn't have to miss moments because of a design flaw! Autofocus is the only practical option for point and shoot where theres no optical view finder.. Updated. on Dec 16, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. good quality pictures and zoom. 
Cons:. S L O W .... and what's the point if pictures don't upload to your computer?. 
Summary:. This is a very slow camera, slow to turn on, slow to take pictures, and the internal software won't take more than ~ 10 shots in a row w/o freezing up.. Further, despite all the software updates I am now unable to upload pics from my camera to my mac. Both Nikon and Mac have been no help.. I am returning this **** camera for a full refund. What a waste of my money and time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Close up resolution. 
Cons:. Slow in all categories, poor focus, purple fringe, locks up - needs to be rebooted, poor gui. 
Summary:. My 1st and last Nikon. Don't buy by reputation. This camera is terrible. Lost too many great shots to inability to focus, slow response, lock-up/reboot, and low resolution telephotos. My Alaska vacation will not be remembered with admiration due to the P80's inability to deliver!!!. Shame on Nikon.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this 10/08 the LCD display blacked out. I never dropped it! I hardly used it &#38; the Manuf will not cover it. They sent it back &#38; the camera does not open, says"Lens Error,remove cap" so now i have no use 4 it. I spent $400 @ walmart. Im an. 
Cons:. I will never buy electronics from wlmrt again and this nikon service sucks! dont even buy it, its a waste of time and money.. 
Summary:. NIKON service people are rude and cheap! They gave me the run around and made me send it to a nikon service company that doesnt even do business with the manf so i would hve to pay out of pocket either way. now i have to pay for the shipping back to. i already spent 15 to send it to the manufacturer in New York! Ugh!!!.
