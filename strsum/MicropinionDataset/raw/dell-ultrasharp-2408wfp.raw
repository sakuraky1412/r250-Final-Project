Pros:. All the inputs you could ever need. Swivel stand. Visually STUNNING. Great price.. 
Cons:. None at all. Zero. If you look VERY HARD and run multiple LCD test utilities you can find flaws in ANY monitor. Stop looking, stop stressing and enjoy the most beautiful color and contrast EVER seen.. 
Summary:. This is THE desktop graphics, gaming and work LCD to have. I originally bought this being influenced by an E3 show in Los Angeles. EVERY game company it seemed was using THIS monitor to showcase their games on every system from PS3/Xbox360 to the PC and Mac. I figured if they used this to showcase their games to graphic perfection, with the media staring at them from all sides, then this MUST be the monitor to have... and I was right about that.. HDMI, VGA, DVI Component, Composite. As well, two USB2.0 ports, a speaker connector. PIP/PBP so I run my security camera or my TV in a small window thru composite, and have my PC on the DVI, and my Xbox360 thru HDMI and I just LOVE THIS MONITOR!!. I even love the stand! Being able to turn this sideways to play Visual Pinball full screen makes it PERFECT for virtual pinball games. It feels and looks like you're at a real table playing.. Buy it. Stop looking around. This is the one to get. More people will complain then those that will come to a site just to compliment a product. As with any product there will be defects here and there. I've purchase 22 of these (for my company and 4 at home) and not ONE of them had even so much as a dead pixel on them. If it did, Dell would replace it without issue. Buy it. Do it. NOW dammit!! ;-). 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality(From DVD's to Desktop use),connectivity options,relative price,great option for anyone with light sensitivity/eyesight issues (on a Mac anyway).. 
Cons:. None of note.. 
Summary:. I couldn't recommend the Dell 2408 WFP highly enough (Unless you can afford a 27' or 30" monitor,in which case I'd recommend the largest screen you can afford,but don't put quality before size ie. In which case,look to Dell anyway).. 

$$;
Pros:. By far the best monitor that I have ever owned or used. The 1,920 x 1,200 resolution makes it perfect for DVD movies.. 
Cons:. This monitor generates alot of heat, and good luck to anyone that has to deal with Dell's customer service (which in all fairness I have not had to with this product).. 
Summary:. Dell lowered the price by $100 and sent me a $50 discount and that cinched the deal for me. I have owned two UltraSharp displays and have never had any problems with them at all. Likewise, the Dell desktops that I have owned (I currently have a Dimention 9100) have been rock solid, and I would definitely consider purchasing another system from them.. I won't repeat the points mentioned in the CNET review and just say that I would recommend this display to anyone looking for an outstanding 24" monitor. Watch for special prices/discounts - Dell currently (07-31-09) has the 2408WFP for $439.. 

$$;
Pros:. large 24" screen. fast refresh rate. no software to install. impressive design; visually and structurally. plenty of inputs. PIP split screen. 
Cons:. I really dont have any. I dont like dell laptops or computers, but Ive always like their monitors. As far as Im concerned this is every thing I could want in a monitor at this time.. 
Summary:. This monitor is a bit more pricey than others in the 24" category, but I feel for me that it is worth it. I got rid of my TV in my room since this was large enough, and it had multiple inputs for the xbox and stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. Laser sharp display, especially with a digital connection. 1920x1200 resolution is perfect for the screen size, narrow frame around the screen, vibrant colors, very good viewing angles, but not as good as I-IPS screens.. 
Cons:. Colors are not quite "linear" or "neutral" for the professional or hobbyist, default color balance is quite skewed towards reds and greens, analog inputs are not as spectacular.. 
Summary:. Basically, it's one of the few 24" PVA screens on the market. It's not as good as an I-IPS panel, but it also sells for half the price. For those who have stuck with the common TN panels for many years, this premium panel is worth it for the wow factor.. 

$$;
Pros:. You have Display Port,2-DVI, HDMI,Component, S-Video,Composite, USB in a 9 in 2 card reader. This monitor has Picture in Picture.. 
Cons:. The colors are off but you can tune it.. 
Summary:. Ok there are Display port to DVI cables available on-line. There are also DVI-D to HDMI cables too. So you could mix and match. For example 4 HDMI connections.. Compatibility with DVI and HDMI. The DVI signal is electrically compatible with HDMI video signal; no signal conversion needs to take place when an adapter is used and consequently no loss in video quality occurs. As such HDMI is backward compatible with Digital Visual Interface carrying digital video (DVI-D or DVI-I, but not DVI-A) used on modern computer monitors and graphics cards. This means that a DVI-D source can drive an HDMI monitor, or vice versa, by means of a suitable adapter or cable, but the audio and remote control features of HDMI will not be available. Additionally, without support for High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) on the DVI input, the signal source will prevent the end user from viewing or recording HDCP protected content. (Note that HDCP is available on some DVI connections). Source: Wikipedia search HDMI. So this monitor is a buy and I bought one. I will use the following on it. PS3(HDMI),Xbox 360 1stGen(component),Mac Mini(DVI), MacBook Pro(DVI), a gaming PC(Display Port to DVI-D cable) and a work PC (SVGA).. 

$$;
Pros:. Design, Performance, 3 year warranty, and I got it for $490!. 
Cons:. Wish it had speakers. 
Summary:. This is by far the best 24" monitor money can buy. I happened to scoop one of these up brand new from ebay(I know its risky) for $490. I just finished watching Blu Ray version of 300. I have to tell you that the visual experience was phenomenal coupled with 5.1 surround sound, I actually felt like I was part of the movie. Becuase it is an S-PVA panel, this monitor has no ghosting, superb color gamut, perfect viewing angles, and the 6ms response time has no effect as I still pwn in CS:S. I highly recommend this monitor to anyone who wants full hi-def and a plethora of features...did I mention the features?. 2 x DVI with HDCP support. HDMI. DisplayPort. Analog (VGA). Component. S-Video. Composite. As well as,. (2) USB 2.0 - left, (2) USB 2.0 - back. 9-in-2 Flash reader. (USB connection to PC required). Audio out. Optional speaker bar. Most people won't use these features, however the fact that Dell didn't skip over anything is awesome. Displayport is one of the more unique things about this screen. All in all this a superb monitor that will please even the harshest critics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very even, bright illumination, even at off-center viewing angles.. 
Cons:. Color calibration could be better. 
Summary:. Great monitor for graphic designers and photgraphy buffs, especially if you purchase a color calibrator. I use mostly for writing code which is great on such a readable, high-resolution monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge real estate, tons of connectivity options, swivel, height, rotate, and angle adjustments. and most importantly beautiful picture.. 
Cons:. Hope you got a healthy wallet.. USB ports and media card reader only work with the display on.. 
Summary:. I chose the Dell UltraSharp because of my past experience with Dell MONITORS, which I have to say has been pretty good. I wanted it as soon as it came out, and I had to pay the early-adopter tax to get it. But I have not been disappointed. The picture is wonderful, the options are great, the adjustments let you make this exactly what you need it to be. Monitor, TV (HD looks awesome) for your xbox360 (understanding that its not 1080p) or whatever. It's easy to work with, its easy to move and it has a bevy of connectors. HDMI, Display Port, 2 DVI, VGA, Component, Composite, and audio out for your speakers.. The only gripe I have is that the USB and media card reader don't work when the display is off. That was a problem for me because I wanted to use the usb ports on the side to connect my iPhone and sync it when I went to bed. I shut the power on the monitor off, and when I got up the next morning.... I don't tend to read manuals or instructions, so this may have been mentioned, but the truth is, killing power to the monitor should not render these features useless.. 

$$;
Pros:. never had a 24" monitor before. How did I live without it? 2408WFP is bright, clear and sharp. The hight adjustable swivel stand was a surprise to me...very nicely done. Setup was plug and play...no issues. 
Cons:. Wish it was $75 cheaper. It's sorta thick...but who cares.. 
Summary:. Really, it's an awesome monitor. I'm glad I spent extra money to get a good one with a good adjustable stand. If I was Dell, I would have dropped the built in USB hub and memory stick readers and saved 75$. Then it would have been perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stable, clean image, work well in dual setup, rotatable orientation, optional external speaker... Zero dead pixels, rock solid after one year. This thing is quick under XP with a Dell supplied 256MB ATI Radeon 2400 XT driving two full res screens.. 
Cons:. Silver edging at top of bezel distracting in vertical side-by-side arrangement - keep it black.. 
Summary:. Clean, bright and just does its job well. Really well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Dell really has it made, bells and whistles are almost like an HDTV in terms of connectivity, bright and crisp, and clear picture. Totally customizable picture settings, and loads of fun stuff to do.. 
Cons:. Even tho the contrast ratio is nice, I really don't see a deep black level on here, which is somewhat disappointing. I know it's an LCD, but S-PVA technology usually allows for the squid-ink black levels, hopefully I find some calibrations soon.. 
Summary:. Nice gaming monitor, has a game mode in the presets, without a doubt, this is far better than the monitor that it replaced (Samsung SyncMaster T240). No dead pixels that I can see, and it seems to be pretty good in picture quality, albeit it's still in "torch" mode that it shipped with. I'll have to figure out how to make the picture more natural. If anyone can help me with that, that would be very much appreciated. Other than that, this is definitely worth every penny of that extra premium for what it can do.. Updated. on Mar 6, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Fabulous picture, multiple inputs, swivels for portrait. 
Cons:. Needs a modern video card to drive it. 
Summary:. Just got mine on June 23; got lucky and received a good one, no complaints at all. Very crisp display, bright images, vibrant colors. VGA input couldn't handle the 800x600 signal from an older video card, but once I swapped in a new card and drove it at native 1920x1200 -- holy shmokes! Also hooked up a Sony Blu-Ray player, watched "No Country for Old Men". Best LCD movie experience I've ever had. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Crystal clear image, flawless performance. 
Cons:. None I can think of. 
Summary:. The best monitor I have ever owned. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It does everything I want it to and does it well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, very good black level, capable of displaying color as advertised.. 
Cons:. Response time is not "awesome", NEEDS CALIBRATION.. 
Summary:. This is my first review ever. I currently have two of these in my office here, both get used for graphic design and video production.. I must say, these monitors are "wild." The default brightness level is WAY to bright and the saturation of the Reds and Greens is almost blinding at first. If you are not prepared to get a color calibration device and calibrate it properly, you're in for a VERY bright and colorful computing experience.. For example, you will notice, very quickly, that you'll need to enable the color management feature in firefox in order to get a color managed web browsing experience (google it, it's a hidden option in firefox.) If you use IE, or firefox without enabling color management, the reds and greens will be so over saturated, it's almost "clown like" browsing experience.. So, to sum this up. You will NEED to properly calibrate this monitor and enable the firefox color management option, if not, while your reds and greens will be colorful, it will not be very accurate.. Final note: again, if you calibrate this monitor, you will have something which can compete, somewhat, with EIZO's top of the line coloredge offerings. Also, to all you PVA haters, I'd just like to remind you that EIZO uses S-PVA panels, just like this dell.. 

$$;
Pros:. 110% color gamut. 
Cons:. superb. it's very cool. 
Summary:. TrueColor technology that allows for 110% color gamut.. super Full HD LCD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of real estate for multi-tasking, Color is amazing. Sharp HD. Lots of connections.. 
Cons:. Digital audio a maybe, would be best for HD. Small problem with text, sometimes showing a green shadow.. 
Summary:. My first ever on line review because the product is so good I'd recommend it to anyone. I've read some on line comments about problems with bleeding and banding.. In a totally dark room I see a little bit in upper left corner, in normal light, nothing. Banding? I magnified a screen cap and measured "banding" at 8 pixels. The green ghosting on text is no big deal for me. No dead pixels or bright pixels and with Dell's return policy not a problem at all. I've seen people say they'll wait for revision A01 but why? If you get a good one like I did, enjoy, if not, return and get a good one, Dell makes it easy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Multimedia Image Quality, Functionality, Large Selection of Inputs, Incredible Color Gamut, No Ghosting in Games, Better than Average Display Options, Great Bang for the Buck. 
Cons:. Buttons are relatively clumsy...Static Image Quality isn't Perfect but isn't all that bad either.Other than that...This monitor ROCKS!. 
Summary:. Having been a previous owner of the 2407 Dell Ultrasharp Monitor I was a little concerned about ghosting as a problem in this monitor as the 2407 had a TERRIBLE ghosting problem in games and movies probably due to the factory cranking the overdrive up to ludicrous speed..."We've turned plaid!!". Suffice to say that I was more than pleased when I hooked this monitor up to my PC and my Xbox 360 and found that my new monitor displayed no noticeable ghosting at all.. In fact, ghosting aside the image quality on this monitor is astonishing. With just a little tweaking in the options menu I discovered just how beautiful gaming and 1080p movies could be. The colors are accurately displayed for the most part. Like I said...A little adjustment is needed...But goodlord...After I was done with my tuning, this monitor really POPS!. Many inputs make this monitor an excellent multimedia display for a bedroom or office. I found the HDMI and RGB inputs to be relatively useless for HD movie play back in 1080p due to display scaling / cropping, however there are two DVI inputs that will display an HD input PERFECTLY!. Static image quality is probably a little sketchy for those of you who make a living off of that sort of thing. I noticed a little color shifting in some of my static test images. If your just an average consumer you won't notice though as the picture quality is still WAY above average.. For gaming this monitor is SPECTACULAR. The changes I noticed going from the old one to this are simply mind bending. EVE looks incredible. You can really see how much love DELL put in this monitor for gamers over the 2407.. I recommend this monitor to anyone and everyone. At this price point it just can't be beat.. Thanks for reading my article.. Gar. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge! Great detail. No viewing issues when used with an appropriately equipped PC and DVI cable or HDMI.. 
Cons:. Eats electricity. Pretty think (but whatever, I have the room). Tilt to rotate need, but again minor.. 
Summary:. I have the monitor hooked up to a new Dell system at work. It is amazing in that configuration. A monitor with a similarly configured system, RAM, video card, etc. Like anything you mix and match, I could see buying this monitor, or many others for that matter, and it does not work as you like. I have not gamed with it. I have DVD'd with it. And hours upon hours of general office use, including Photoshop, Autocad, Illustrator and so forth. In that circumstance, it is exceptional. Again, on my system built and configured to work right with this behemoth. At home I have an iMac (fully top line outfitted) and that (or this since I am on it now) is amazing. Just not seeing all the negatives some of you have so it may just be configuration compatibility issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. I had no problems with this except it does not handle Texas lightning storms. Oh well I need a excuse for the 30 inch monitor. This has several usb ports and even a SD reader, which was a lot more convenient than I would have imagined.. 
Cons:. The only con is that it's not the 30 inch. If you're going to buy the sweet 24 inch then cut corners somewhere else, eat ramen and get the 30 inch.. 
Summary:. I have had very good luck with Dell products at work and home. The computers have gone down in quality a small bit in the past year. The monitors have actually gone up in quality in the past year. The only thing I have to say about the 24 inch is, if you can at all afford it or cut corners elsewhere, just spring for the 30 inch. Also get the big warranty and a big power surge too, which is what I didn't do. But the silver lining is, I'll soon have a spanking new 30 inch monitor. Unless there's something bigger....... Dell Monitors have never let me down, ever.. 

$$;
Pros:. All the hookups you could want. Pivot the monitor for easy access. CF, SD, and USB on the left side. Flawless screen. The higher quality PVA panal. Very solid and easily adjustable base (up/down height, left/right swivel, forward/back tilt).. 
Cons:. Would be hard to find.. 
Summary:. Ordered (from Dell) on the 10th or 11th of January 2009, and shipped on the 13th, this absolutely pristine monitor arrived on our doorstep today. Small text is crystal clear and sharp, colors are spectacular, monitor is bright and strong, and you may want to tune that down slightly. Immediately out of the box and quickly assembled and connected it performs sensationally. Have not observed any heat issues (at all) or (blue) color issues noted by others on other sites. Other than dialing down the brightness slightly, nothing more needed to be done. My son is very content playing World of Warcraft on this gorgeous monitor. It pivots too! Wife likes that. Big Dell discount on these right now (Jan 2009).. 

$$;
Pros:. Nicely designed with portrait mode capability. Wide variety of video inputs, multiple digital and analog. Include most of the cables for inputs. Resolution is excellent. Really easy to setup, lightweight for its size. 
Cons:. Screen lighting unformity isn't that good. Control functions very difficult to use. Supernova bright out of the box. Needs a video card with pretty robust software controls. 
Summary:. I just bought two 2408WFP's and have them side by side. I like two-screen setups because I do alot of layout work and imaging work at the same time. Monitors were both blindingly bright, with complete oversaturation of reds. Took me about 20 minutes on each screen to get the picture to acceptable color, detail and get black level set. A good professional-quality calibration is really a good idea with this monitor and I'll be doing that this week. But it is possible to get the panel dialed in pretty close with software calibration. I'm using ATI video card and it works well with both monitors.. I was disappointed, though, in one of the panels lack of uniformity in screen lighting. With no picture, just black, the left side of the screen is a bit brighter than the right side. There are also anomalies in the corners. The other monitor is better in this regard, but it's a concern about Dell's quality control. With most material, the problem is not that noticeable, but still.... I really dislike the on-screen control system. It's difficult to punch all these buttons, and the choices are difficult to navigate. I used the ATI software to do most of the settings. All in all, a great value for a 24 incher, with just a few warts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning color and contrast; lots of adjustability, connection options, good value.. 
Cons:. Not the smoothest text rendering, may require some calibration. 
Summary:. Overall, this is an excellent monitorthe image quality is great, excellent motion-response for video and games, minimal if any ghosting, and lots of picture adjustments. The connection options are very nice if you plan to connect multiple devices, although I personally haven't used any of them, so I can't speak to any limitations or caveats.. I also use an Apple display of the same size (which is twice the price, due largely to the aluminum enclosure), and this Dell preforms better in almost every way. The one thing I really like about the apple display is that it's text display is quite a bit smoother. I'm on a mac where high-quality text anti-aliasing is standard, so that's a tiny bit disappointing. Still, probably the only reason I notice it is because the Apple does it slightly better. Also, the Dell is slightly slower waking from standby. In most other ways the Dell is superior (adjustability, color, contrast).. I'm very happy with the Dell and I've had no dead pixels or other problems of any kind.. 

$$;
Pros:. No Ghosting when playing games. General use super!. 
Cons:. Heavy Monitor, bulky. 
Summary:. This is the best monitor I've ever had just a tad bulky and heavy. Bought the Acer 22" just did not like the picture (cool BLUUE) so i bought this one great product goes nice with my 420.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very nice picture.. 
Cons:. Developed bad pixels after a year. 
Summary:. After a year developed more and more bad pixels. Tech support at Dell was great and sent me a new monitor, a U2410. Assume it is latest version. Picture looks just as good. Hopefully the hardware will hold up.. 

$$;
Pros:. large and bright. pretty good quality for the money. 
Cons:. input lag. color is a little off. 
Summary:. honestly, if your not a professional or not a big gamer, its a great monitor. But if lag and color is important to you, look elsewhere. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Color, Good brightness, Many Inputs / Outputs. 
Cons:. Flickering, ColorBleed, Dark Conors, Varm, INPUTLAG!. 
Summary:. On the paper this is a overall great monitor with good color, interface, and brightness, and that is possibly why reviewers have given this monitor so great reviews.. But Testing out fancy images and color templates have nothing to do with real use and this is where this monitor falls through. As a highend product you do expect some quality.. First of all the input lag is gigantic. 0.60 sec in avrage input test from various sites and i can 100% agree. Its horrible.. If you have too much text on the screen at once the screen starts to "distort" itself in some wierd way. Text itself is also very unsharp.. If you want a 24 inch monitor go buy it somewhere else. Dell's 24 inch is not worth the buck.. 

$$;
Pros:. The monitor is actually good. But CNET excessive sponsoring and advertising has made me lose confidence on this site. I don't think they offer unbiased reviews. It is how much you pay us and we say nice things about your product.. 
Cons:. Dude... yes, you the reviewer, you were reading a script the whole time. You should know what you are talking about! No need to look like an unprofessional news anchor... I miss Bonnie Cha. 
Summary:. I am out of here..... 

$$;
Pros:. - solid build. - cheap. - big screen. - ergonomic stand. 
Cons:. - bad image quality. - strains your eyes. - greenish effect around text. 
Summary:. I don't know why CNET rated this monitor so high. I guess Dell persuaded them. So much for "unbiased review"!!!. This monitor has very bad image quality with default factory settings. For example, look at people's photos on Web pages - they all look like either their skin is sunburned or they are drunk. The picture quality can be improved if it is recalibrated, but even after that it has big issues with oversaturated Red and Green. People on photos look like they are drunk (reddish faces). Some colors are plain wrong even after calibration (i.e. cyan can have magenta tones). This is the biggest downside of this monitor - even if you don't do graphical design, you normally make pictures of your realtives and they all gonna look pink on this monitor.. The second big problem --- It strains your eyes - there is some flickering on lower brightness setting that is used most often. Your eyes get tired pretty quickly. The only way to fix it is to put it to 100 brightness and then lower brightness on your video card.. Also, there is a greenish effect around the text. It can be minimized if recalibarated, but does not disappear completely.. There is some lag in the games, not big, but still visible.. On a positive side - it is big, it has a solid design and good ergonomical stand. There are many different video connectors. It is relatively cheap.. I have Dell 2407 at work and I think it is better than 2408. I decided to buy 2408 just because I assumed that it can be an improvement over 2407. I guess I was wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. Do you guys get a lot of money from dell lobby there products frankly dell monitors are a big disappointing ! i am a trained designer and i know it for a fact there are loads of nicer monitors around. 
Cons:. average very very average and ugly looking !. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide viewing angles, build quality, included features. 
Cons:. Wide Color Gamut unable to correctly display sRGB images, bad input lag. 
Summary:. I just purchased 2 of these 2408WFP's to use as dual monitors. I thought I did all my homework prior to making the purchase but evidently not. The model currently shipping is a first version and has major issues. Just check the Dell Support Forums...customers with this monitor are eagerly awaiting a new hardware revision!!!. First, the wide color gamut is basically incompatible with Internet Explorer! (and any other non-color managed applications!) Most images on the web and in most other applications use the standard sRGB color profile. This monitor does a poor job in displaying these images. Users are having to use special color-managed web browsers for this monitor!. Second, this monitor has been found to have the worst input lag of just about any LCD! Gamers be warned...this monitor is NOT for you! The input lag is so bad it's even noticeable in scrolling on web pages!. Dell is promising an updated revision that should fix the input lag and other issues. Not sure how they will address the color gamut issue if even at all. What this monitor needs is a sRGB color profile mode for everyday use!!!. 
Updated. Just to add a few more comments to my original review.... Additional Pros: True Blacks (Wow!), PVA-type panel. The input lag is totally different from the "Response Time" spec. If you put the 2 together you get the overall time it takes the screen to be refreshed. You have to add the input lag to the 6ms Response Time spec and in the case of this monitor you'll get way worse than anything near 6ms!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Stand. 
Cons:. Compatability. 
Summary:. A computer store recommended this monitor to me. I bought the monitor, and soon after random coloured dots started appearing on the screen. This progressed to a flickering screen, and finally to a screen that would blank out. I bought a new video card, but it still blanked out. The computer store sent the monitor back for a second one. The brand new second monitor also blanked out. Dell refused to refund the computer store for the monitor; all they would do is keep sending back the same type of monitor that didn't work. Luckily the store replaced the monitor. I am now happily using a Nec monitor with no issues. Dell refused to post this review on its own site. As a result, I lost the use of my computer for 6 weeks, while the store had to argue with Dell.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size. Connectivity. 
Cons:. DisplayPort connection does not work. DVI connection in and out (black screen). supernova bright and you can feel the heat on the screen. High energy use. **** poor technical support. 
Summary:. Bought this monitor in part because of the CNET review, but also needed the DisplayPort connection for the new graphics cards (Nviidia Quadro FX3800). The monitor did not recognize the signal on the DisplayPort connection and with the DVI cable the signal was on and off (went into sleep mode). Tried to rectify with an updated driver from Dell and could not find on their website (can't get much help without a Service Tag #). Was on the phone for 1.5 hours with technical support getting passed from rep to rep. Technical support personnel don't know they make monitors, won't help you without a service tag #, and one asked what a "DisplayPort" was? After they put me back in the automated que, I gave up and requested a refund. I am done with Dell.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's big, decent resolution, and multiple inputs. The monitor physical orientation is flexible and very adjustable.. 
Cons:. Although the monitor has decent resolution, the text rendition is only mediocre making it difficult to read and use the monitor for extended periods. Bad pixels developed after 6 months. Dell makes it very difficult to get warranty coverage.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Great colour reproduction. - Quality build stand. 
Cons:. - Uneven colour distribution - brighter on left side. - Input lag is terrible. - Dell customer service is TERRIBLE.. 
Summary:. Why did i bother sopending AU$900 on this peace of junk! Do NOT buy this monitor. I have purchased this monitor based on CNets review and I can't believe they have got it so worng. Bought the 2408wfp Rev1 and it still suffers from many of the problems from Rev0. I called Dell to have it replaced after a week with a new one but after a week of waitng I called back and they prtended that I never called in the first place! Then I had to organise another replacement. They sent me a refurbished Rev1 (used) and it was even worst than my oroginal.. I bought this from Dell expecting quality and good service - and got none of these!. 

$$;
Pros:. Swiveling, Sharp Text. 
Cons:. Color reproduction is horrible. Green and Reds are neon. 
Summary:. Using this monitor felt like I was in Las Vegas at night. The colors (green/red) were neon. All this is after calibration using all its functions. The editors must not have too much knowledge of color to rate this monitor so high. (Maybe it was because Dell sponsored them?) I promptly returned the monitor for a full refund.. 

$$;
Pros:. overall quality. for gamers. warranty. 
Cons:. Color saturation. Unnatural and fluorescent colors. Useless for photoshopping and graphic purposes. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of features, cheap, bright.. 
Cons:. Big, bulky, build quality is very low (very plastic), not as sharp as Apple Cinema Display, color is not suitable for serious graphical needs (photography, printing). Easy to get eye fatigue.. 
Summary:. My wife does serious photography editing and design, and she has an Apple 24" LED Cinema display. It is stunning, and very easy on the eyes. On the other hand, I do a lot of programming and email, so I originally didn't care about color and looks and bought a Dell 2408wfp purely based on specifications. This Dell is a big step up from my 20" Dell that's about 5 years old. At every aspect, the Dell on paper seems superior to the Apple in terms of bang for bucks, and in terms of amazing features. Dell wins every aspect, hands down.. The Dell is pretty cheap, and if you catch Dell deals at the right time you can get it directly from Dell for $450 with shipping and handling! When I got it, I was super excited. I opened the box, and boy oh boy, this has got to be one of the clunkiest, plastic looking behemoth I've ever seen. It's thick, bulky, and looks very... typical PC, which is alright, because I've been a PC person all my life. Function over form, right?. It has a very very bright backlight and the colors are quite vivid, and it's a pretty good deal considering how little you pay for so much features. However, after using it for a while, I realized that I was getting a lot of eye fatigue. During the day, I needed to turn the brightness from the default eye blinding 50 down to about 15, and at night, I needed to turn it down to 0. Even at 0, it is still eye blindingly bright. This has got to be one of the brightest monitors I've ever had in my life, and if you find it appealing to look at bright monitors like how moths fly to those bug lanterns, you'll love this Dell. One of the most annoying thing about the Dell is that to change the brightness, you must get into the Dell menu-- minus button (to call the brightness menu), minus button again to get into brightness selection, Enter to select it, then finally -/+ to select brightness, then Enter, then plus to select Exit, then Enter. That's at least 7 buttons!!! On a Mac, you can do it in 2 seconds. I can't believe how bad the usability on the Dell is even after so many years that they could have improved it. The next most irritating thing about this monitor is the lack of power-off feature. If your laptop is suspended, it'll go to sleep. But the moment you unplug it to go out, it goes back alive and says "No input" instead of sleeping gracefully. Everytime I unplug, I also have to remember to turn it off manually, which is really annoying. Even my old Dell monitor slept when I unplugged it. The inconsistent user interface is just yet another example of how badly engineered this monitor is.. As for color, I don't know what to say. If your life doesn't require knowing what sRGB, AdobeRGB, raw, color calibration, printing, etc, then it doesn't matter. However, I do some basic web design and photography, and I've had no choice but to calibrate the monitor. By default, this monitor is too bright, and too vivid for serious photographic needs, and requires a calibration hardware+software (I use Spyder3Pro which although not spectacular, gets the job done).. I've always wondered why the Apple LED Cinema display looked sharper, and simply looked nicer. So I took my Nikkor 105mm f/2.8 micro lens VR for a 1:1 repro close-up macro on an APS-C camera, which resolves much more resolution than a naked eye can possibly see (near microscopic). Go to Amazon to see the pictures I uploaded. the Apple display is superior in terms of clarity. If this Dell is suppose to be ultra sharp, then the Apple is "superiorly" sharper (and without hurting your eyes). As for color... the colors on the Macs just look better, pre-calibrated without much adjustments needed. If it weren't for the fact that my current computer doesn't support mini-DisplayPort, I'd have gotten an Apple LED display already. I guess I'll just have to wait for my next big upgrade so that I can get the Apple display.. In short, if you're a programmer or just a casual emailer/web browser, and if you want the MOST features or the brightest backlighting hitting your eye balls, and if you don't care anything about sRGB/AdobeRGB/etc... this Dell is an awesome monitor. It probably has one of the best bangs for bucks, with tons of features like multiple video inputs and card readers which I do find very useful since I do a lot of digital photography. On paper, the specifications are very impressive. On the other hand, if you want a well built, well designed, and great looking graphical display for serious photography and serious graphical needs, one that looks good on your desktop and is easy on the eyes, one with excellent resale values year after year... if these things matter to you more, then the Apple 24" LED Cinema Display is really worth every single penny..

Pros:. Cheap; Might be ok for average user.. 
Cons:. Very very bad for games. 6ms does not tell the whole story. Be prepared to drop your online score by AT LEAST 50% for action games.. 
Summary:. Bought one about 2 years ago for my personal use. Not bad although you have to use it at a very low brightness if you do work like programming/editing documents, otherwise expect some serious eye strain. As for my FPS / action gaming, that when out the window and I'm back to my cheap 19" LCD for that.. Yesterday I got a brand new 24" dell for work. All I can say is it's horrible next to my 22" dell. The 22"'s quality looks like a $1000 vs a $300. Yes, I've tried all the settings from preset to custom. All I can say is... 1) If you're going to have thin back line i.e. text on white then stay away!. 2) If you're planning on playing games like Quake, COD, Oblivion i.e. games where you have to turn quickly then stay away!. I'm very disappointed, wish I just ordered another 22" :(.

Pros:. None: they couldn't deliver. 
Cons:. Dell put a hold on my Mastercard for $633, then canceled the order. 
Summary:. I ordered this great-sounding monitor online from Dell. When I checked by email the next day to determine the status of the order, the information I got was that the order was canceled. I called Dell -- four times, and spoke to eleven different people, was referred to two specialists who weren't available and a third whose voicemail was full. The gist of it is that Dell put a hold on my Mastercard account for $633, and canceled the order because -- they say -- the order was not approved. Luckily, it only took a second call to Mastercard to void the whole transaction. I had forgotten about Dell's Three Stooges approach to customer service, and came out of it feeling like I'd been through a Chinese fire drill in a subway and emerged with my wallet missing. If this is how they treat people trying to make a purchase, imagine what trying to navigate the warranty servicing would be like. I'll find another monitor from a more reputable dealer. Caveat emptor..

Pros:. Best monitor I will never buy. 
Cons:. Somehow Dell calculates $600 = �800 (rather than �387). 
Summary:. I was about to go buy one of these, when I checked the prices here in Europe.. I'm not sure what these folks have been smoking, but the price in Europe is *double* the US price. Kind of ironic since it is made in Asia somewhere - I don't think the shipment to Europe costs $600 more than the shipment to the US.. It would be cheaper to fly to the US and back to buy it..
