 first of all, the interior has way too many cheap plastic parts like the cheap plastic center piece that houses the clock .

 3 blown struts at 30,000 miles, interior trim coming loose and rattling squeaking, stains on paint, and bug splats taking paint off, premature uneven brake wear, on 3rd windshield   .

 insanely cheap plastic all over interior .

 disappointed in interior and exterior quality .

 i love the color of the exterior and interior   .

this car is nearly perfect when compared to other cars in this class regarding interior dimensions, visibility, exterior styling, etc .

 several parts in the interior rattle including the sunroof and some parts of the dash, the radio randomly will eject cds, etc .

 the interior is roomy, the ride is smooth and solid and yet it has excellent gas mileage .

 the interior looks good but feels cheap compared to my 1997 le camry .

 the interior is large, the controls are well placed and simple .

 interior noise level is unacceptable ,  this is one noisy car on the freeway .

 i love the exterior, but the interior is nothing to brag about .

 the interior could use some work to make it not so cheap and plastic looking .

 the biggest complaints are the softness of the seat, the super cheap interior dash plastic and the location of the door pulls, they render the door arm rests useless .

 the interior looks great to me .

 this interior is as good or better than others in it's class .

 the interior is stylish, roomy and has many nice features .

 5 poor craftsmanship on interior .

 cheapened interior materials, flimsy steering wheel switch gear, less padding in seats, only a 2, way power passenger seat, plastic covered board for seat, back map pockets, baby, puke yellow fake wood trim, etc .

, all combine to paint a less than luxerious interior .

 only thing would like to see is that the interior be made more available in the darker   in the se .

i love everything about my camry, except for the interior looks, very cheap and the non alloy rims are very cheesy or cheap .

 the car also does not allow fresh air through the vents  if the ac isn't on, the interior becomes very warm, very quickly .

 looks are great and interior is comfortable, but it ?

 even the interior has not held up along with the awful wind noise at highway speeds .

 the controls were installed without a problem no cutting of interior plastic, the knee airbag was bypassed .

 interior looks ok but is built a little cheap .

 the interior is so very quiet, you must compare this car to a cadillac .

the interior is very luxurious and comfortable, however the car feels slower than my 2002 camry le .

i like the looks and interior but as described in some of the other reviews it has a hesitation problem when you slow down or brake, and then get back on the throttle .

 also, the sound system is so poor unless you are willing to spend $3k more to get the jbl and leather interior, which come together .

 interior quality is very poor .

 fit and finish are exquisite, the interior is extremely well designed, looks good, fun to drive .

 sound system is excellent and interior was adequate but the room is awesome !

 the interior feels that of a lexus or bmw and the exterior is an eye catcher .

 i love its avalon like roomy interior and great looks .

 the exterior and interior are nice .

 like the looks and styling, both interior and exterior .

 interior exterior quality is very good .

3 it is a good interior and exterior design and should be copied by other car makers, but the mpg for the 2 .

 very low interior noise level, which adds to the long trip comfort .

 the styling does not say  camry  anymore and the interior is mostly excellent ,  door handles are too hard and plasticky, some rattles especially when cold outside, not overly fond of the center console design .

 the camry has a ton of style and lots of interior room without being to bulky on the outside .

 it serves the purpose in which i bought it, and i really do like the roomy interior and the new styling, but there really is no fun factor to it .

 horrible quality of interior .

 after driving it a few days, the interior squeaking and rubbing noises increased so much that i drove to toyota and had the body shop manager check to see if it had been in a major accident .

 the interior is very roomy and spacious and toyota has given some nice standard features in le .

 the interior design is excellent   .

 interior is very nice and quiet .

 very comfortable, quiet interior .

 new interior is very pleasing to the eye and am happy to have features like tire pressure indicator, side airbags, 4 wheel disc brakes and 16 inch wheels included as standard .

 feels expensive, yet comfortable with larger interior than my grand prix .

 i love the body style and the interior .

 exterior reminds me of a 530i and the interior is plush especially with the light woodgrain finish .

 the interior is on par with other cars in its class, but not up to the fit and finish of previous camrys   .

 examples include fit and finish  had to have the drivers door realigned due to metal, to, metal contact causing terrible rattling  , poor fit of interior parts, which causes a lot of rattling, especially when it's cold out  the auto tranny has a history of serious problems and acts weird, and lastly the paint quality, which chips very easily .

 the interior is top notch and the navigation system is very intuitive .

 customizable features which don't require dealer help like some brands auto lock modes, interior light modes, etc .

 interior is simple and well laid out .

 the blue neon center console makes the interior look really cool, every single person that's been in my car loved it .

 interior materials are far better than my old mazda and v6 power is nuts .

 i get positive comments each day on the exterior interior design .

i bought this car smitten by its exterior look and interior comfort .

 the interior is classy, the standard mp3 is useful, the host of curtain bags and standard features add to the plus .

 the new design is very aggressive on toyota's part and the interior design is very contemporary .

 the ride is quieter, the car faster, the exterior and interior looks better .

 the interior is nice and roomy and the exterior design is beautiful .

 great ride, engine, interior, gas mileage .

 it shifts hard, has a lot of play in steering, has quite a few blind spots & the interior is cheap plastic which scratches very easy .

 the sunroof actually comes down and slides between the exterior and interior thus minmizing wind noise at speed .

 the leather interior is worth the money .

 luxurious interior, great mp3 player addition .

 the interior is fairly pleasant but suffers from too much hard plastic and some poor fits !

 the interior is very quiet at highway speeds .

 the cloth interior is great and the 4 cylinder has tons of power for such a small engine .

 on top of that some interior trim pieces didn't match and one fell off !

 smooth and responsive interior is as luxurious as you can get without slapping an l on the grill .

 the first one was returned to the dealer, on the day of delivery, because of excessive rattling noises coming from the interior, especially the back right side of the car .

 the ride is refined, steering is tight, plenty of interior space, the exterior design is refreshing to look at .

 my only complaint with the interior is the color of the fake wood :

 the interior is much more comfortable than my last 3 camrys and the exterior styling is oh so chic .

 imho, the exterior and performance are way better than other trims, though you can't compare interior of se with xle .

 interior is extremely quiet on the hiway .

 love the looks, power, roomy interior, good mileage at 32 hwy and 25 city .

 interior still has too much hard plastic, especially the steering wheel, which has a raised crease hitting on the fingers as a constant reminder .

 it has nice luxury interior  , but it also has nice pick up speed and is very roomy .

 i like the wood grain accents with the tan colored interior   but i don't think is looks as good with the gray interior .

 excellent interior build quality .

 the new interior design is ok to me, the blue, backgound center console is a little bit awkward, too bright at night .

 ash leather interior with light yellow fake wood trim is just ok design .

 leather interior very comfortable .

 the interior is upgraded markedly, and although there is a bit less headroom, the added telescoping feature of the steering wheel combined with the greater travel of the seat   yields greater comfort .

 nice looking interior but seats are very hard and are not comfortable for long trips .

 there are so many interior improvements and well as engineering improvements .

 i am in, love with my moonroof, 440 watt 6, disc stereo system, and the interior gauges that illuminates in blue is probably my favorite .

this is my second camry and i like it, especially the art decoish design and simplicity of interior controls .

 my barcelona red metallic exterior and dark charcoal interior are a perfect combination .

 top notch rating on interior comfort .

all around this car is amazing, its sleek exterior and futuristic interior is sure to turn some heads .

 second, the interior designer should be fired .

 it is surprising how spacious the interior is on a long trip .

 the plastic interior looks and feels cheap .

 the interior is okay and i have not had any rattles or squeaks .

 the interior rattles, with pieces falling off, the ride is not that great, and the handling of the vehicle is absolutely the worst i have ever experienced .
