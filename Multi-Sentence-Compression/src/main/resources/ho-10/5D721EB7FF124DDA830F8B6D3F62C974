this would have been a 5 star but and call me a party pooper if you want , but it was totally bl***y ruined by the continuous trail of chattering people walking right outside the front window - absolutely ridiculous set up when one considers how amazing the accomodation actually is .

pathetic and basically the management need to sort it out as it ruins what i would call perfection .
