hotel terra is right in teton village and literally 5 minutes away from the slopes .
they have their own ski/snowboard rental shop downstairs and you can literally buy a lift ticket and be on the slopes within 5-10m of leaving your hotel room .
food : - room service not that great- our pizza arrived lukewarm and breakfast room service came as 2 sandwiches in a brown paper bag .
also was annoyed that i picked a bunch of stuff i wanted for room service and when i called got told i must have an old menu- so then i had to wait for them to bring me a new menu and of course all the stuff i wanted was n't on the new menu- update your room service menu 's people ! !
- osteria is there full service restaurant and is pretty good , but not the best italian i 've ever had .
service : - concierge was very nice setting up reservations , ski lesson , etc .
shoutout to evan who helped us multiple times and was super nice .
- front desk people were also very nice and helpful spa : - chill spa was rated best spa in the area in 2015 , and our treatments were awesome , but when we left i found out i got upcharged for the aromatherapy , which we were not told about .
made me feel kind of cheated- was n't about the money at all .
- try to enjoy the rooftop hot tub if it 's not . . .

- try to enjoy the rooftop hot tub if it 's not 10 degrees outside overall a good , but not great hotel .
location great , they are trying , but it 's missing that 5th star.
