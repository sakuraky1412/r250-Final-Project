i have owned this for well over a year now , and had perfect results with mine .
i love the z san file system , lots of people complain that it wont allow you to plug your hard drive back into a pc and have it recognized , well most nas devices do not .
zetera is a big name and the file system used on this is the same used in big corporate nas devices .
it never requires a defrag .
i love this thing so much i bought the new sc101t gigabit version for my media files and made this just my system backup .
both are working flawlessly .
if these people took the time to investigate the device , investigate zetera/z san and investigated the other nas devices for the same price , they would see this is a winner .
easy to use works great .
i think a lot of negative reviews have to do with earlier firmware , there were issues with dlink routers and the first releases of the firmware .
has been running over 3 months without a hitch with up to five machines accessing .
over the past year or so i 've tried all kinds of detached , network storage drives usb , firewire , ethernet nas , etc .
they all have limitations that make them less than desirable .
the netgear storage central is the only product that really solved all my problems .
it is easy to install and configure .
i highly recommend it to all .
this is a really cool little gadget .
and unlike other gadgets that are fun to have but not necessarily needed , i think this one is important for just about every home to have , especially one like mine which has become cluttered with too much electronics junk over the past decade my husband is a digital pack rat .
our computer hard drives are always overloaded with stuff tons of music files , photos , video and voice files .
not to mention my tv scripts and screenplays that i would just die if i lost .
we back up , but to cds .
so we 've got all these old hard drives , cds and even old floppy s cluttering up our drawers and closets .
i could n't stand it anymore , so i put my foot down storage central has been incredible .
i did n't even think anything like it is available .
there 's tons of storage capacity -LRB- we loaded it with two drives right away -RRB- .
we 're transferring all of our stuff onto the thing .
the great part is that i usually have to rely on my husband to do these things because they 're too technical and i do n't have the energy to deal with it .
but storage central 's interface is really easy to use much like using windows .
and i 've discovered that you can create separate drives for different categories of files .
for example , create a g drive for photos , and h drive for music , an i drive for video , etc .
it all gets saved to the same place , but it appears to you that the files are in separate places , making it easier to organize .
very clever .
my husband is also very impressed with storage central 's ability to back up files so that if your system fails , your data wo n't be lost forever .
something called mirroring .
i do n't know how to explain it , so i 'll take his word for it anyway , i 'm very happy with my new toy .
i hope this review helps those of you who are n't technical wizards and who do not understand half of what 's usually written about in these cnet reviews .
-LRB- i 'm giving it a perfect score for now .
if i run into any issues/problems , i 'll revise .
after months of waiting , i finally got my hands on the storage central today .
i picked the unit up from fry 's for $ 129 and picked up two 200gb maxtor drives from staples for $ 79 each that 's a 400gb san storage system for about $ 300 .
setup is very easy and quick with the only problem being my trend micro firewall keeping my computer from seeing the sc101 .
once i disabled the firewall , the sc101 is found and i is able to quickly begin alloting my storage space in about 30 minute 's time , i is able to create a 50gb mirrored drive for my valuable data -LRB- photos , videos , etc . -RRB-
and create private password protected letter drives for each of my five household pcs because my storage central drives appear as local letter drives on each computer , i is able to set up the included smartsync pro software to automatically backup my laptop 's documents to the storage central i have been using a buffalo linkstation nas solution and the storage central blows it away in file access and data transfer speeds .
the storage central product is well worth the investment .
this is unlike any other storage solution that i 've seen for the consumer and small business users .
i 'm thinking of getting another one .
very hard to beat for that kind of money hell i 'm going back to circuit city right now .
buy this unit , it works very well , you must must update the firmware .
warning .
if you plan to use it as a file server , it will be totally outclassed by any cheap usb drive that can be shared on a network .
very very slow file transfers , unbearable actually .
it would be faster to read from a floppy drive .
once the files are on the drive , they are easily streamed to any media player with only a very minimal seek delay .
the unit will serve it 's role for me so overall i am pleased .
if you want a file server , buy a bare bone computer with raid on the mobo and build a file server , it will be a bit more expensive , but it will be 1000 times faster .
the ability for the owner to add drives on the fly is great .
the interface program is easy to install in vista or xp .
the fact that you can use your old ide drives is great too .
when the unit has worked for constant duty for over one hour , it does get warm , but the drives are still within a normal range .
when not being used , the drive is cold as ice .
hope this helps .
i been using this for one month and i have to say i am really impressed how well it performs .
it is so great to be able to span drives and mirror a group of sc101 .
one more thing to note is netgear support has been really helpfull in understanding the usefullness of this device .
well , it seems to work for me .
i plugged it into my network and installed the software on all of my 3 computers and no problem .
it streams video very well with no issues it does get hot under maximum load .
122 degree f under full load .
i have not measured idle yet good value for the money for me .
1 tb for $ 650 cdn .
great .
had terrible speed problems with native connection over wifi , changed to using a wired connection to one pc and using windows shares to wifi clients and this now runs like a dream recommended .
the hardare -LRB- 200 gb seagate hdd -RRB- and software installed easily on my xp system asking to get the most current version from the internet -LRB- recommended -RRB- .
i did have to answer yes as instructed to several warning messages which left me wondering about stability .
after reading of different problems , i installed the latest firmware update from the internet -LRB- absolute requirement -RRB- .
i have not experienced a single glitch and i am sharing it among 4 computers in my workgroup .
my toaster is delivered by courier at 8 am and by 8 .
15 am i is ready to transfer my first files completely true , but i guess this is only possible due to the fact i had read so many reviews of the pit falls .
i always research new products thoroughly before purchasing and because i had to wait 3 weeks for availability , i is well read by the time it turned up .
i do not think i have ever bought a product that has created so much emotion .
to anybody considering purchasing the sc101 i thought i would just point you in the right direction most rellers i have come accross have the option of package deals with drives already included .
these usually are more cost effective but make sure you are not buying inferior drives if you are buying you own drive or considering using ones you already have , check the compatiblity list at www .
netgear .
com you require an ide or pata drive and not a sata drive .
-LRB- wide ribbon conection -RRB- i also considered finding a drive that operates quietly and not at high temperatures .
there are no fans in the sc101 , it uses heat sinks to draw off heat when you install your drives make sure you set the drive jumpers to cable after you have connected your sc101 to the network make sure your router is set to dhcp .
most modern routers have dhcp and the chances are you are already running it .
dhcp automatically selects local ip addresses on your network when you intall the software , do not use the disc that is provided .
download the latest utility and firmware from netgear .
many people have had problems with the older software hopefully you will have a pleasant introduction to your storage central like i did so far i am very pleased with my sc101 's performance .
my network runs as fast as it ever did .
i have tranfered over 50 gegs of images and data using lan and wireless 802 .
g there are no signs of any heat problems what so ever , so i guess the latest firmware has fixed that problem i am still assessing the smartsync pro software that accompanied my toaster , and must admit that using the sync facility keeps the amount of data to be tranfered to a minimum .
only the changed files are rewritten .
looks like a keeper at this stage enjoy .
i coded my fist line of basic on an abc80 some 25 years ago and a few weeks ago i got my first automated perfectly safe mirrored back up with the sc101 as a core contributor .
thesc101 makes me sleep better at night .
very pratical device .
my whole family is using it -LRB- at the same -RRB- time due to its sharing ability volumes show up as a letter drive making it very easy to use great product , great idea .
i 've had this for a couple of weeks now , and it 's been great ; a really excellent device i have it running with a couple of 300gb hard drives in it , and have partitioned the drives to do what i want to do with them first , i have created one drive -LRB- that 's what the sc101 software calls a partition -RRB- of 100gb which is mirrored -LRB- so a constant backup of that drive is taken to the second hard drive so that if one of the hard drives fails , i loose no data -RRB- .
on this one , i keep all of my important things all my photos from my digital camera , all my documents , all sorts of other things that i do n't want to loose then , i have 200gb free space left on both of the discs , so what i did is make one spanned partition -LRB- well , the sc101 calls it a drive you make one 200gb drive and then you add capacity to that drive and add on the 200gb space that is free on the other hard disc -RRB- and that gets me a drive of 400gb which is great for keeping things on i do n't care about , like some videos and stuff like that i know that if one of the hard discs fails , then i will loose all of the data on that spanned drive , but that does n't really bother me and i do n't like having tons of drives on my machine speedwise , it 's good .
when writing data to the sc101 , the mirrored drive is slower than the spanned one , and this is the only reason that i have n't given it a 10/10 .
i get about 6mb/sec to it which is fine for me , that 's more than enough to play dvds off , or stream anything i want .
but it is a lot slower than a hard drive in my machine that 's to be expected , though .
after all , this is running across ethernet i did not have any problems setting this up and getting going at all .
the thing does get hot , that 's for sure , but it 's not like it 's threatening to catch fire .
actually , i think it runs cooler than drives do when they are in my computer i 've spoken to technical support about the sc101 , and they tell me that if i wanted to , i could buy a second one and could even span my 400gb drive to add more capacity from other hard discs in other sc101s on my network .
sounds like fun , but of course you are risking loosing the lot .
they also tell me that if you have two sc101s , you can mirror drives across sc101s , which i think would be great for the ultimate in data security have one hidden in a cupboard or something and then if you get burgled , you 've got all your data mirrored and safe even if one sc101 gets nicked .
it s about time someone came out with a device like this .
this is the kind of network storing capabilities you get in the office of a good sized company .
now you can have it at home .
and you d think it would cost a fortune but it s totally affordable for what you re getting out of it .
put all of your files on it , from every computer in your house .
easy to use , friendly interface , automatic backup to prevent data loss , works wirelessly .
and don t worry about security , they ve got that one figured out too .
highly recommended .
i 've used every network storage device out in my day and this one is by far the most affordable , efficient , painless and smallest network storage installation anywhere .
my dog can set this up it 's so easy step 1 .
plug in power supply .
step 2 .
install driver software .
step 3 .
create 120gb shared/mirror drive .
step 4 .
copy all your multimedia files and docs to new drive letter in windows explorer step 5 .
go away and leave it alone i have interrupted many network file transfers before for not being patient .
i know this product is not going to solve that and i have learned that it 's just a matter of time before this product and other 's alike figure out how to make everything work better and faster by the way , did i mention i did this over a 802 .
11g wireless wep connection .
is nothing to it on my xp pro sp2 box and my netgear fwg114p router and built in broadcom wireless nic i 've experienced other wireless issue 's before with many other products like digital phones , neighbor 's wireless router stepping on mine , 128 encryption settings , etc but those kinks were worked out before coming across this product that is recommended to me by a friend that just bought one online .
i purchased this from fry 's a few days ago and had it up and running in 9 minutes this is the network storage device i 've been waiting for for a loooooonnnngggggg time once you create a volume is appears as a letter drive ; i .
d , e , f drive .
this i really like because all of my backup apps can preform as normal as well as normal copy commands the only possible negative is that you have to include insert the hdd -LRB- s -RRB- but the is a plus for me since i wanted to install 2 250g drives which i did .
i now have a screaming 1/2 terabit box .
i suspect that many users will favor this hhd insertion because it gives them the choice of hdd .
by the way , they made it very easy to install the hdd 's .
took me less than a minute to insert the 2 250g hdds very happy so far .
did everything the box said it would .
i got the 1st one at frys for $ 120 the sales guys opened the 1st box while i is there i bought 2 ide 200mb seagate drives for $ 60 each -LRB- after rebate -RRB- and plugged them in $ 240 for a 400mb drive .
i installed the zns scsi drivers and attached a 160mb raid 0 drive on three pcs .
one of the cool features is that all pcs have rw access to the same drive so far it works great but with some limitations .
the pc must be on the same subnet as the sc101 .
i could not run a vmware server from the sc101 .
seems slower than a shared drive .
i need to run some benchmarks .
but it 's fast enough for what i want it for 4 .
no mac/unix support yet , but all that is needed is a driver in the future .
this thing rocks .
i finally got my unit from cdw -LRB- $ 115 -RRB- and i is up and running in no more than 10 mins .
i 've got 4 pcs sharing 3 volumes for all my media .
i even played a different ripped dvd from the same unit to three pcs at the same time with not issues smartsync so far is really cool , backup and synchronization , which means i can work from any computer and have backup to make sure you use the mirroring feature with storage central .
most people do not realize that consumer priced hard disk drives can fail .
this has a great mirroring feature which will keep you protected if it dies i am getting another one for work all my mp3s yes .
folks , .
i bought 4 of these as cost is super low listen carefully 1 .
you must update units for them to even begin work properly the config/reliability issues most users complained about are the result of earlier versions of product that must have been really awful 2 .
if you have a mixed xp/vista environemnt as i have you need to be systematic in your reading and application of fixes usrers have posted on net .
i found solution for my biggest problem -LRB- vista driver install -RRB- on net in 10 minutes note to netgear please get this on your site asap as your product deserves better than it is getting 3 .
i would only use drives tested and and recommended by netgar -LRB- if i wanted to be sure unit would work the twin 400 gb seagates and twin 80 gb hitachi drives worked fine .
i suspect some of th thermal issues referencd on reviews have to do with using drives not on list as units are sealed hot running drives could be a real problem on the whole buy one and see if you follow posts someone even has the unit working for various unit implementations .
again , netgear should really assign a single good tech for one day to comb web for solutions and get these into knowledge base for users .
the unit is very upsetting to use if you do n't follow the instructions carefully .
bear in mind the unit does not think you have a home network except for your desktop router and the central storage unit .
make sure all other computers on the network is shut down before installation .
once 1 computer is up set up folders to mirror that computer for example desktop 1 will have a folder setup as desktop 1 and any time a change is made it will sync immediately .
you can do this with each of your computers at home and have immediate backup like raid 1 .
by the way do not use the internal raid it makes the system run really slow and very hot .
lastly to share data just map the drive to each system so all data can be shared .
if this is kind of a private setup you can have the administrator see all the data but all other units will only be seen by that very computer .
this is a nice unit and with 500g harddrives dropping to less than 140 each you do the math you can have a terabyte backup for as little as 350 or less -LRB- there are 2 drive bays you only need one to start .
lets see you do that with the other solutions out there .
there is one problem this unit only takes ide drives , they make one that takes sata however the unit cost more but it is suppose to be faster .
i do n't know because i do n't use the unit .
in summary , keep things simple and the central storage once configure will do as promise .
and after your first hd crash you will love this unit .
forgot to mention a fail safe of this drive it uses a different filing system so lets say someone took your drive they wo n't be able to read it .
also lets say you put in a fat or ntfs drive it wo not read it and will destroy the data and reformat the filing system is cool in which it is more secure and also does not need to do normal defraging .
it takes care of itself .
hope this review helps compare to all the negative ones out there .
fortunately , i had read some of the forums before buying the storage central and knew what i is letting myself in for .
you must make sure you download the latest version of firmware and scm before installing the hardware .
doing this means that the vast majority of bugs and problems associated with the unit are avoided .
certainly , for me , installation is a breeze and the drives have been completely reliable since installation a month or so ago .
rtfm an absolute must i have a couple of 400g hitachi drives mirrored in mine , with no significant heat problems .
even the 15 hour -LRB- . -RRB-
transfer of initial data to the drives did not cause excessive heat .
not being particularly used to storage over ethernet , i is a little disappointed with access and transfer times , although i gather it is not particularly slow in that respect .
it is certainly capable of streaming 1080i hd video and i 've not had any trouble streaming music or accessing files whilst having the drive mirrored brings some security to my data , i am still uncomfortable in case the sc101 itself should die .
not being able to take the drive out and install it back in my computer is a real cause of concern ; i find myself backing the sc101 up back to my main computer , which kind of defeats the object of remote mirrored drives .
i would dearly love to see a driver which addresses this problem although not an issue yet , having the drives only accessible from windows may be a problem if i ever find time to start playing with linux on my spare computer .
having to install the scm utility on all computers is a bit of a pain but it does mean that it genuinely appears as a local drive , useful for some software that does not like remote drives finally , i also have one of the netgear mp101 media streaming devices .
it would have been great to see netgear ` twin ' these devices so i do not need to leave my computer on 24/7 .
another future update perhaps .
overall , extremely impressed with no major gripes but in the back of my mind i am left wondering if i would be better off setting up raid on my main computer .
great device .
i think san and nas drives in a large network have a place and can save money and server resources .
3 reviews before mine -LRB- 2 very favorable -RRB- and netgear is quoting it on their website , i wonder whos reviews they really are .
netgear you wouldnt resort to this type of dirty tactics would you .
i suffered not being able to share my sc101 files stored there by my windows desktop with my macbook .
check out newt data systems -LRB- www .
newtdata .
com -RRB- for a mac package that cures this problem .
i can now download movies with my windows desktop and share them with my mac even when my destop is turned off .
this really gives a new life to my toaster .
i 've had the drive since the beginning of 2007 .
no problems whatsoever , neither with the installation , nor operation .
i put in a 7200 rpm , 250 gig drive we used it to share music pictures among a few pc 's , and i also use another pc to back up the sc101 .
this backup process -LRB- 40 gig -RRB- would take around 5 hours i just use it for simple , shared storage .
i dont care about raid protection , or secured folders .
for this use , it 's wonderful the main issue that i 'm having , is that netgear has not come out with some vista capable software .
their website says that one will be available 1st half of 2007 .
it 's now the last week of the 1st half of 2007 , and still nothing .
their technical support will only regurgitate what the website says i have just purchased an hp media vault mv2020 .
500 gig of storage , vista compatible .
looks like my sc101 will be in the next garage sale .
i picked up a refurb one of these off ebay to check out .
it is pretty simple to set up , although it wo n't even function unless you install a hard drive , as i learned while attempting to update the firmware before installing drives into it .
on another technical note , the automatic firmware update enforced by the latest installation utility can not be initiated if running xp large dpi display mode as the yes/no boxes are obscured networking flexibility was not what i had hoped for -LRB- dhcp only , no real options other than changing sizes and enabling standby mode , needs software client to function -RRB- .
it also does not function using a conventional file system so you can not set ntfs file permissions , defrag it , benchmark via conventional hard drive methods , or run chkdsk on it i benchmarked the peak write performance by monitoring total bytes/sec of the network redirector , and it 's about 4 .
5 megs/sec .
reads peak at under 6 megs/sec , so the fact it does n't have a gigabit interface is irrelevant .
it did not seem to be picky about the hard drive used during my testing , as i put a whiny old 5400rpm 40gb drive in it , which worked flawlessly .
the passively cooled drive slots are designed for 1 height drives so do n't plan to put slimline drives -LRB- eg seagate 7200 .
10 160g -RRB- into the enclosure as there are no screw mounts i would not recommend this product for high performance applications , or for highly technical users as they will be left wanting from a performance and functionality perspective the device pretty much manages itself which is what most soho users running their own network are looking for .
these users are looking for a simple and effective storage solution , i think it does a nice job .
it does what it claims , it just does not do a whole lot more which is what usually impresses me about netgear routers -LRB- from a technical features perspective -RRB- .
my needs for a storage device were fairly straight forward a remote location to store my ever expanding digital picture and music files , and the ability to backup the my documents folder and subdirectory contents , while retaining the ability to easily access said files on an as needed basis .
after researching the available options , i decided on the sc101 due to its reasonable price considering the disk mirroring and backup capabilities i installed 2 seagate 300gb drives that i found on sale for $ 99 each , so for about $ 450 i have more than enough capacity for current and future file storage needs .
i found the disk installation to be straight forward , as well as connecting the sc101 into my network hub , so long as you follow the installation directions regarding the sequence in which to plug the unit into the network .
i partitioned the storage unit into multiple drive letters -LRB- one mirrored drive each for picture and music files , and one non mirrored drive for the my documents backup -RRB- the backup software works well , and i particularly like its ability to run any time i save changes to a document within the my documents folder .
for the less frequently accessed and less critical files , i set up a weekly scheduled backup .
while the backups are running , i find my laptop 's performance to lag a bit , but the system performace does not degrade to the point that i can not reasonably use my laptop you can access files directly from any of the sc101 's drives in the same way that you would access a file from your c drive , but i found the speed to access and view the file on the storage device to be slow .
however , i do not know if this is solely due to the sc101 or if my laptop 's 10mb network card contributes to the less than blazing file access speed as others have mentioned , no cooling fan exists for the sc101 , and the top of the unit does become hot after prolonged disk access .
if the sc101 is not accessed within a 15 minute period , the hard drives stop spinning , so based upon the manner in which i use the unit , i consider the heat to be a non issue overall , i consider the sc101 to be a cost effective option for users who wish to store files apart from their main computer , and back up their important files .
great product which makes backups and automatic synching of files between pc and backup simple .
i love it .
i could n't pass this up when i saw it at staples today for $ 119 .
00 including a free maxtor 80gb drive -LRB- normally about $ 80 -RRB- .
i already had a brand new maxtor 250 gb drive so i put both of them in the unit my setup is one wired desktop , a wireless desktop , and two wireless laptops -LRB- a dell inspiron and a gateway -RRB- .
i started by installing the software from the cd that came with it on the wired desktop .
i did n't get to first base .
when i told it to look for updates , it would just hang .
i read a post in this forum about getting the latest stuff first and then installing , so i went to the netgear site and downloaded both the flash update and the update to the manager software .
i installed the new version of the manager software on top of the version i had already installed , opted to skip the included update feature -LRB- which still does n't work -RRB- for a manual update of the flash .
once i skipped that , the rest of the manager software installed and i set up my drives on the unit .
the manager software , even the latest version , is crap .
on my wired desktop system , it wo n't exit .
i have to use task manager to shut it down when i am finished with it .
fortunately , you do n't have to use it often once you have set things up the second computer i tried to set up is the dell wireless laptop .
on that one i tried to set up a drive and the manager would just hang on formatting .
the drive would be set up , but would n't be formatted .
you can not format with xp because the format is different .
i tried it just for kicks and it hung too .
the manager did , however , exit properly on that machine to solve that problem i went back to the original desktop , removed the drive i had set up for the laptop , and set up the drive again for it , since formatting worked ok from that computer on to the wireless desktop , also a dell .
the manager installed flawlessly on that machine and set up a drive with no problem the last machine i set up is the gateway laptop .
i did n't have any problems with it , although i had already set up the drive for it from another machine once everything is set up , it all worked fine .
once the drives are set up , you can attach them or detach them at will .
i set up a drive on the unit for each of my four computers , and each of them boots with that drive installed automatically .
the management software provides very little flexibility for configuration of the drives -LRB- just the bare minimum -RRB- in all i think the concept is ok , but the software needs a lot of work and i 'm not sure why they include a cd that is 4 versions out of date and firmware that is also woefully out of date .
i assume that their automatic update feature when you first get into the manager is supposed to keep it up to date , but it never worked on mine and just hung when i tried to check for updates if i had it to do over again , i still would , but only because i got the free drive with the unit .
i am a computer professional of 30 + years and even i is frustrated by the poor installation software .
novices or newbies would be totally lost .
if i had not manually updated my system -LRB- thanks to a suggestion in these posts -RRB- , i never would have gotten it to work .
i did not read the reviews before buying this , and is considering returning it to staples .
however , it has found its place in my home network i bought 2 300gb drives for $ 320 , plus $ 100 for this , so i got 600gb of network storage for about $ 420 .
not bad .
this is going to be my multimedia storage box .
saving and replaying a 360m video file is no problem .
all my music is stored on one of the drives and i 've had no problem with storage/playback .
windows media player 10 has had no problems talking to the unit so , its cheap , but it does come at a price .
much of which has been mentioned already .
i 'll just review less than optimal interface for setup a bit slow for the initial seek , but read times adequate for most media thruput annoying ` autoplay ' , but the fix mentioned in a previous post is a very easy workaround -LRB- tweakui .
exe from microsoft -RRB- .
software to recognize the device must be installed on each computer .
tolerable for a few computers but a certain headache if you have an office full of folks needing access the drives , once formatted will only work in this device .
if you want to use the drives elsewhere , you need to copy the whole thing to a temp folder , and then reformat the drive in the new machine .
then copy back from the temp folder .
is this a problem .
i decided that the odds of me needing to move the drive to a new computer are slim , so it should never be a factor overall , i did not return the unit and am generally happy with my purchase .
there are a few annoyances , but it is suiting my needs in my home network just fine .
i is looking for a device to put into my home automation structured wiring cabinet so i could all the computers in the home back up software to this unit .
the device does achieve my goal , but i 'm returning it because of its short comings netgear needs to fix these simple but basic problems and this device will sell like hot cakes good .
all computers with netgear 's software downloaded onto it could read/write to this drive it is really small -LRB- ~ 4 inches wide -RRB- .
they made it very simple -LRB- i like simplicity -RRB- bad .
signs of shoddy engineering -LRB- particularly in the install software -RRB- runs very hot .
it needs to be air cooled .
it would never be acceptable in a structured wiring case having odd disconnects from it .
i think the reason is that it gets too hot , that the mechanics make it run unreliable slow .
writing to it is reasonable -LRB- @ 25 % the speed of a normal hd -RRB- , but reading items from it takes unbearably long .
this is acceptable to backup items which is what the main purpose for this drive is can not get it to keep a consistent drive letter on xp .
i want it to be always ` h ' on all my computers but i 'm having no luck .
after reading the forums , it is partly microsoft 's problem too always runs ` autoplay ' every time the computer boots up .
again , it is annoying hard disks are formatted in a proprietary format -LRB- not fat32 nor ntsf -RRB- .
they can not be switched back into one 's computer internal drive and be able to read from it .
i picked up one of these to use my old ide drives that were just sitting around cheap i wrestled to get it all working .
the fact that every computer that is going to access these drives will need the zetera z san software installed and configured is a huge problem , if you ask me .
newer devices are just ` plug and play ' if you can get a refurb one of these cheap , have some spare ide drives around to fill them , and are willing to take on a do it yourself project to get them working optimally , go ahead but if you 're not a tinkerer , steer clear of these devices .
i 've never used this product i 'm curious about it , though .
has anyone made this work with a mac , running mac os x 10 .
3 or higher .
i 'm not sure why a wireless external hard drive would be windows only , but maybe that 's just the bundled software .
the system works reasonably well , when it is working .
at all costs avoid the online updates , of the 5 i 've done so far only the first one worked perfectly .
the other ones caused either the scm utility not to detect the device , the latest 4 .
13 with utility 2 .
24 cant detect any partitions .
customer services gives the impression of a very polite person in some call centre in bangalore working off a tailored script , and its a new person responding every time so you have to start from the top again and answer irrelevant questions .
with respect to the sc101 we need , for the general user , a more user friendly product .
have had the product for about 3 months , as of this writing it seems to work ok , eventually .
1 -RRB- a clear manual , in correct english , free of mistakes and contradictions , so it can not be .
misunderstood easily by the average user .
2 -RRB- netgear needs to tone down that the sc101 , in its present state , is easy and that it is .
the final and economical solution to the storage problem people increasingly have .
3 -RRB- the netgear software updates should have appropriate warnings/alerts .
for a user like me so i/he/she is better informed what the individual .
commands are actually doing or not doing .
4 -RRB- the appearing and disappearing of the drives and their partitions is .
really a nuisance and this should be fixed with the highest priority by .
netgear .
5 -RRB- an option to use fixed ip addresses should come with the software .
updates to increase stability/reliability of the system .
6 -RRB- holes in the chassis could perhaps provide better cooling thereby .
prolonging the life of the drives and probably their reliability , too 7 -RRB- the product makes the impression that the user is used as a field tester because of these shortcomings i rate the product below average but do recognize its potential that may eventually be realized if user complaints are used to fix the system in its current state still i think , conceptually the idea of the sc101 is good and once it is .
stable , it can probably be a good system .
but to get it stable requires .
an extraordinary patience and more than average insight into the .
workings of the sc101 , its interaction with the lan and router , and the .
functioning of the lan itself .
typically the average user does not have that .
knowlegde , time and experience readily available when he/she decides to install .
new lan capabilities for home or small office use .
what could have been a very useful product is hurt badly by software that has data entry boxes half covered horizontally by the next line , pages chopped vertically and entry boxes that are un usable .
after reading the previous reviews i had hopped that the bugs reported were fixed in the latest firmware .
i is able to get the latest firmware upgrade -LRB- oct 28th 2005 -RRB- .
the heat problems seem to have been fixed .
however i still have problems with the product maintainng its drive letter between reboots .
so then i have to go through the entire installation process again .
it is a real pain .
i wanted this to be a time saver .
instead it has been a time waster .
i read all the reviews on this and other sites -LRB- including netgear forums -RRB- , and decided to try it anyway .
i wanted to like it ; i tried to like it .
and at $ 99 after rebate , the price is great .
but in the end , it had to go back .
i is not at all concerned about the heat problem -LRB- and had the new firmware that spins down the disk so it worried me even less -RRB- my big problem is that it kept dropping from the network and i had to use the various work arounds from the netgear forums to get it back -LRB- including editting the registry -RRB- .
it happened almost every time my wife would put her laptop into standby .
maybe this would not be a problem with desktop machine that stays on all the time .
but in the end , i had to take it back i 've ordered an external enclosure and for the time being we 'll be using the drive i bought to it as a usb drive -LRB- i 'm looking into various devices that allow you to mount usb drives onto the network since we really want nas like no sense in having a battery operated laptop with wireless network if you still have to haul around and plug in a usb drive . -RRB-
i think this is really a good idea and this one of probably the best of various nas solutions i looked at , since it 's expandable -LRB- when you can buy 250gb hdds for way under $ 100 it 's a much cheaper solution than the buffalo 's terastation which is what i 'd really love to have , but too pricey -RRB- .
if they could just have done it w/o needing the client software i 'd still be using it -LRB- another problem with the client method is that i could not find any way for my laptop from work which is assigned a different domain from home any way to access it -RRB- .
i 'd love to just see the drive like any other shared drive on my network .
i guess we 'll have to see what the next year brings .
i tried using 2 wd800 drives in the box and despite setting everything up exactly as the manual said -LRB- ie cable select on both drives -RRB- , it would not work with them together .
it worked with either drive individually however .
the unit does not use standard windows formatting and i consider that a serious drawback .
also nowhere on the box does it say win xp/2000 only -LRB- does not work with win98se .
overall it took me 12 hours to copy 200gigs of info to the drive thru a 100mbs network the other thing is that each time you boot up a computer with xp it has to rescan the units drives for the windows fastfind feature so it is not just like a local drive as windows does not keep the index between boots .
have had this box for over 1 year .
earlier software is a dog , recent upgrade is more stable , but only marginally better performance however , the box is a nice big heat sink , external disk enclosure for use with something like a kuro box or nslu2 using ide/sata to usb adapters .
best if if not accessed frequently .
when you use this unit as a single mirrored disk , it functions seamlessly and transparently .
however , if mirroring breaks , which i found out -LRB- the hard way -RRB- it can , you 're hung the unit can not restore mirroring period .
you have to decide which disk has the right data -LRB- and there 's no help from the system to do that -RRB- and copy everything from it to another disk on your pc .
bzzzzt .
my sc101 is only 20 % full , and there is no room on my pc 's disks for even that because of this , i decided i had to leave mirroring off , so i wrote jscript programs to do my backups to each disk separately .
this is not mirroring , no matter how much netgear may say it is .
netgear states many places in product literature that any ata6 drive will work .
took over an hour with out sourced support tech -LRB- s -RRB- to get them to admit that the truth is that there are many ide drives that will not work , including my two seagate st350063a 500g drives .
having netgear chose to use offshore support is just frustrating with the support personal only able to follow scripts , until you have to become pushy and ask for a manager .
of course , it took 3 calls before i got to actually have a manager tell me what i already found out , that will work with all drives actually means will work only with drives listed on spec sheet .
normally netgear is much stronger in support and functionality then this large waste of time and money .
i 've gotten over the fact -LRB- somewhat -RRB- that netgear was not clear in their packaging that this device will reformat your pc drive .
essentially , erasing all information i recently purchased a pc with vista and went online to netgear for the utility to access the drive .
it appears netgear has decided vista customers do n't need to access their drive until sometime in 1h '07 .
they do not even have the courtesy to commit to a date .
c'mon will be made available in 1st half of 2007 .
netgear customers deserve better .
well , as the title alludes to , my sc101 ended up at the gun range , pumped full of holes coutesy of my m1 garand .
i removed the drives first , of course .
when i first setup the sc101 , it worked fine really .
the setup process is a little cumbersome but after a few attempts , it is working pretty well .
the problems came when i went to add a second drive .
my original drive disappeared all together , along with all the data .
8o so i called support and got a hold of a completely useless foreigner , no offense , but he just did n't have the information and/or training on the product to be helpful .
he essentially walked me through everything in the troubleshooting sections of the manual and website which i had already exhausted as a resource before calling .
then one day a few weeks later , the drive shows back up again .
needless to say , i quickly copied everything off the drive to a pc readable filesystem , packed up my bag and headed off the gun range for a little target practice .
a good idea , that does not quite make the cut .
spend your money on something a little more ready for primetime .
good idea but horrible design , awful performance .
set mine up with 2 seagate 250 gig hardrives .
loses drive names and letter , does not remember passwords , not very user friendly , auto update for netgear hardly ever works .
very buggy machine .
would not recomend , both my 250 's have failed in it .
i spent 4 phone calls and about 4 hours with tech support after failing on my own to configure/format a drive in the sc101 using my laptop .
no luck .
i became familiar with the ut utility program via the tech support desk -LRB- useful later -RRB- .
the software loaded , but would either fail to initialize the drive or sit for hours without making progress .
all the drives i tried to create were there taking up space -LRB- my 500 gb drive kept getting smaller according to the software -RRB- , but none is accessible .
also , trying help from within the program gave me errors and the pc asked if i wanted to debug the software .
i wanted netgear to have already debugged it .
finally , for some reason , i tried setting up the sc101 from my hp a250n desktop 2 .
6 ghz p4 w/768 mb ram running xp home -LRB- i consider this to be a terrible computer it barely works a lot of the time and requires constant attention the memory does not clear after applications close -RRB- .
surprise .
setup of a 100gb partition took about 1 minute , so i set up another one too -LRB- i first deleted all the nonfunctional partitions using their ip addresses and the ut utility -RRB- ok , to share on the network , it would be nice for my laptop to have access .
so , back to the laptop .
i could not attach the drives -LRB- partitions -RRB- a failure message is returned every time .
i is about ready to lose my temper .
again , for some unknown reason , i went into the advanced mode -LRB- for those who know what they are doing ha , as if netgear does -RRB- , and here the software worked to attach the drives .
so , i have to say the the software is a disaster unreliable , requiring guesswork and different approaches from one computer to the next .
i have the latest version , and the latest firmware , and my computers are pretty generic everything is working , finally .
so i backed up the laptop disk with norton ghost to a password protected partition .
this took 8 hours for 30 gb .
really useful , that i had wanted to keep up with ghost restore points for my laptop when i is away from my usb backup drives -LRB- working via wireless it is the latest , you should try it -RRB- .
with the slow transfer to the disk , it seems that this will not be practical .
i guess we 'll find some use for this thing , but i 'm not sure what .
netgear storage central review .
this seemed like such a good idea great looking device , can take upgrades easily , just sits on my network and i can share my music and backups with my family or so i thought actually this requires some very buggy software installed to connect to the device .
the disks can not be ntfs formatted , so you are tied into their ` operating system ' , you can only attach via their drivers and apps , not via windows browsing .
plus the software supplied looks like it cost about 5c to make it does n't work properly -LRB- there is no ` ok ' button when you change password , for example -RRB- , and once i tried to change the password on one of my attached drives , and the machine just rebooted great idea ; just does not work in practice .
you are much better off buying a usb external drive , and plugging it in when you need it or buy a proper nas device richard artes .
oct 2006 .
loading the software is not good , i get all kinds of errors .
tyring to reformat upgraged change drives , no good .
the update software site does not work , even tried shutting off my firewall , and not luck .
unless you are will to gamble , and are an experienced tech with a supplier that can make your return easy , i would take a pass on this one .
problems surround firewalls -LRB- opening a port required , not documented , shutting down firewalls prior to installing not documented -RRB- , software install on each pc , -LRB- software is bugged , seriously , latest releases do not cure all the problems , constant re installing required by many experienced users , registry edits required -RRB- .
some users apparently have no problems .
others could toss this out the window -LRB- see forums -RRB- .
after 1 month i am very close to recycling , but misplaced faith in netgear makes me hold off .
w2k and xp pro home all have issues , not predictable , causes not known , support is not being forthcoming for a majorly flawed product .
boohiss try something else .
this requires that you install software ; a requirement that most real network hard drives do not require the software takes about 15 seconds to find the drive and connect you every time you reboot your system .
software is very limited in how you can share your drives do not buy this .
i still have it for testing but i like my maxtor better .
my personal opinion sorry , not worth the price , even for soho users .
any business should stay away from this , at least the next two sw releases .
before you decide to buy this product , please check the content of the netgear -LRB- support web site -RRB- user forums regarding this device .

i installed my sc101 yesterday , plopped in two wd250gb drives and connected the sc101 to my wgu624 .
i installed the sc101 admin software from one of my laptops , mirrored the disks , and is able to connect to the drive letter , create a few file etc .
so far , beautiful i then tried to copy a large directory of pictures from the laptop -LRB- 802 .
11a -RRB- to the sc101 hmm after about 5 10 minutes of copying , the laptop stopped copying and the process showed up as not responding .
next step is to grab another laptop maybe 802 .
11a is a bit much so this time i tried it with 802 .
11g .
same result .
last attempt take the laptop , and connect it via a cable to the wgu624 .
try to copy the same 10gb of files .
this time success .
so the real question i have i can not imagine that this should not work with my wireless connection .
how can this not work out of the box .
another problem i have with the the sc101 is the heat it produces the enclosure does not allow for enough venting .
i 'm sure my drives will burn up in no time with the amount of heat that is generated .
i read many of the negative reviews of the sc101 , but figured that with my experience i would surely be able to get a system as simple as this to work .
on the netgear forums i have posted some of the things i found that allowed me to get the system up and running .
unfortunately it disappears from the lan regularly .
sometimes it can be seen again by turning off the firewall and running the storage central utility again but then sometimes that doesn ; t work either .
rebooting the router is a frequent requirement .
the as mysteriously as it disappeared , it may reappear .
at the moment my nas is working , but it was not when i started up the lan this morning or yesterday morning .
i would not dare put anything of value on it without an alternative -LRB- reliable -RRB- backup netgear should have to pay people damages for running the sc101 that is how bad it is .
no wonder you can get one on e bay for ten or twelve dollars .
i am sure the people selling them think they are getting the best of the bargain at that netgear makes some very good gear .
this is not one of those updated .
on may 16 , 2010 .
i purchased this device because i had a couple extra drives laying around wanted to use it as backup storage until i can get a better box larger drives .
the fact i also have had good experience with netgear hardware is a plus .
big mistake although it does do the job , it is no where near what i hoped for .
first you have to use the proprietary software that stinks , you cant span drives , you can not access drives with multiple pc 's simultaneously , you can not mirror after creating the drive , you can not read the drives with anything else there is just a whole lot of cannots in this equipment it will serve it 's purpose for now , but i would not recommend it .
buy only if you not care how much time it take to copy the files .
i try to copy 1 .
5 gb file to sc 101 and it shows 36 hours .
normally if i want to copy to my external hdd -LRB- usb -RRB- it takes 10 12 mins i wont recommend this to any one .
been using the sc101 off and on since may of 2008 and i can say not worth it .
i saw the negative reviews but bought anyway since it is reasonably priced .
even with a seagate barracuda 7200rpm drive with 16mb cache it is still very slow .
thats not the deal killer in my mind however , i can deal with the sluggishness of the device .
bigger and main issue is it will routinely disappear from the network without rhyme or reason .
has dropped out of sight even after just using it and going back to save a document .
the only thing that will bring it back is always a reboot of the router , and sometimes a reboot of the pc also .
its always the router first , that usually does it .
if not the pc needs to be rebooted also and it will appear again i downloaded twice the latest firmware as the web site recommended but to no avail shame on netgear for releasing this device .
do not buy .
i bought this product a few years ago because i like the idea of being able to backup files from multiple pcs easily .
it is really bad .
i have troubles with pc 's not being able to find the drive .
it seems i often need to reboot the drive often in order to see it on the network .
the software it comes with seems to be buggy and annoying .
firmware updates that i have attempted have been miserable .
worse of all , i recently bought a mac , and of course , this device is not compatible .
the only link for support after initial period is via email which they may or may not answer .
dead unit replacement re install is now in fourth week , which is not good for home network backup device .
i would not waste your time or money with this device .
the quality is obviously poor when you experience catastrophic equipment failure in 1 year my use of this device is very light .
it is for periodic backups for my desktop pc data files i do n't understand why it does not work .
i am going to go out and by $ 30 worth of cd 's and use those for backup instead i took the two disk drives out of the device and through the device into the trash .
for windows xp .
software must be installed on each client .
not very fast .
no media server support .
runs fairly hot .
thought this is going to be the answer to a shared backup solution .
i had a number of home machines that i needed to backup , but no really good way short of passing around a usb drive to back them up i initially set up initial sc101 with dual wd 250mb ide drives as a raid array and performed a backup for 1 computer .
it worked ok , but is slow .
started a backup on multiple pc 's pointing to this box and it failed to finish , giving a ` drive not ready ' error at both remote pc 's .
reconfigured to jbod and did the same backup test .
it worked with 2 pc 's at the same time , but not with more .
performance really slow purchased another sc101 and populated it with dual 300mb drives to spread the backup load .
sometimes i could see both sc101 units , but most times not netgear support said that updated firmware would solve that problem .
one unit updated correctly , but the other unit failed in the middle and became unusable .
out of warranty is the only response that i got from netgear luckily the data on unit 2 is not important netgear 's networking gear works , but their storage solution leave a bad taste .
not ready for prime time .
does not work with vista mirrors are constantly breaking if anything goes wrong it is not user friendly the zetera -LRB- software writers -RRB- software works better than netgear -LRB- gui -RRB- software and has more options dhcp freak out when the router has a suden loss of power and sc101 does not fully recover and will lose drives and mirrors frequently .
if this drive could have the ability to set the tcp/ip address for each drive it would probably work better dchp has recovery problems .
formatted my drives when i inserted them , no warning .
totally inadequate cooling .
will shorten hard drive life significantly nice idea in principle .
do not know more as i am busy trying recover 200gb of data .
it worked fine to set up and run originally , but netgear has this obsession with always upgradig the firmware .
and so one day i gave into the pressure and did , the netstorage device locked during firmware upgrading , did it according to netgears description .
but now it wo n't get past the self testing phase , so i can not do anything except use it as a door stop plus the drives are encrypted so i can not mount them anywhere else .
netgear support where stumped , but i 've read on the support forums that this is a common issue among netgear storage owners do n't belive the netgear hired reviewers writing that this storage solution is awesome , because it simply is not .
you wo not think so either after you lost 400 gb pictures and documents because you where to stupid to use several back ups .
i purchased this as a way for all the computers in my home to be able to save music and video and also use it as a backup location for the network .
although it does have all the music and videos on it and a lot of other info it is just not working out .
unfortunately i purchased my sc101 from a compusa that is closing some time ago so i will not be getting a refund .
here is what i 've encountered .
no support for windows xp pro x64 so i had to move back to xp pro -LRB- what a pita .
it seems to work ok on xp home edition but major problems on pro .
if the computer goes into powersave mode the sc101 wo n't wake up and then will lock up the computer if you try to look at files using my computer 4 .
performance is about 1/10 that of the sata drive i have in my computer .
-LRB- not good for video -RRB- .
this thing get hot .
i 'm suprised the cables inside have n't melted .
customer support .
uhm well i get responses but nothing has helped so far overall i really wish this product worked as advertised .
looking at the reviews it is -LRB- unfortunately -RRB- nice to see i 'm not the only one .
given the instability of the product i 'm suprised that a class action lawsuit has not been filed against netgear .
the concept is great but falls very short in execution .
if someone wants to get the ball rolling on the class action count me in .
i 'm starting to look at the hp media vault as a better alternative if i had to do it all over again , this would not be the route i 'd take .
netgear should pay people to take these and burn them .
even once i got it working , every few months some glitch would cause it to be unmountable from one or the other of my computers .
plus you need to install software on each pc -LRB- windows only -RRB- that will acces it .
when it works , it 's ok , but the hours you spend trying to troubleshoot problems make this products overall value worse than its weight in trash .
the netgear storage central is a great concept , but when issues come up , online support is outdated , and the manual that comes with the install cd is not accurate .
i 'm constantly loosing all my drives that i 've set up with netgear storage central , its a huge pain in the rear .
is it worth the $ 300 some dollars , i would day no , and will probly persue other storage options .
this unit fried a hard drive , and it took hours to gain access to the remaining hard drive .
drive format is such that a regular pc can not read it .
netgear software is buggy , and lacking useful admin tools .
software crashes on windows 2003 , windows xp and does not support xp mce .
tech support is awful .
data transfer is very , very slow -LRB- over 60 minutes for 150 megs of data , i am transferring all data off the remaining drive -RRB- .
this is totaly unreliable , unit constantly falls off network and needs to be rebooted , then falls off again , often in mid data transfer .
do not under any condition use this as a backup solution , it is not reliable and can not be trusted .
storage only , and make sure to backup the data -LRB- if you can , it is so slow -RRB- .
junk , junk , junk .
setup is quick and easy .
using it is anything but moving large amounts of files , forget it , it fail pretty quickly .
network becomes unusable for anything else while the thing is working .
trying to move files around to different folders on the same drive should simply be within the device , but it floods the network again and makes it unusable i sure hope bestbuy will take this back .
do not expect this device to work properly on the first try .
it performs inconsistently my files appear and disappear , then reappear .
i am using a wired network and the latest drivers and firmware update .
my day job involves supporting servers and pc hardware this device would be shipped back to the vendor in 10 minutes if it were in that environment .
drive usage is reported inconsistently .
drive creation and mirroring fails more often than not .
file transfers are very slow .
spend more money if you data is worth anything to you .
find something that reviews better or build yourself a file server out of an old pc or something .
it really should have more cooling features .
this nas solution is bare bones and priced to match .
love the concept of using my pata drives so i have an excuse to upgrade my pc to the newest sata hdd 's .
hated the need to install a client , so win98 .
read speed is decent , but write speeds were abysmally slow with larger size files but beware but this thing ended up fouling up my computer 's disk drive mgmt on one computer , and the drive letter would disappear until a full network reboot -LRB- toaster , router , then pc -RRB- , and then disappear the next time i rebooted .
what 's worse , windows could not restart or shut down .
i should preface by saying at one point i dropped my wife 's hdd into my rig to move some backup date over there -LRB- wifi was not cutting it -RRB- , and this displaced the toaster 's drive letter , d , which i had manually switched the toaster to in disk mgmt .
since that move , even after removing the other hdd , it made all my disk mgmt flaky , even on internal drives .
i 'm still in the hunt for a good nas solution -LRB- d link 323 sounds good + many more features -RRB- , but this one is not worth it .
i had spent over one month to try to make this work i lost space and can not reuse it .
software download is slow is snail crawling .
online submission support is poor and no feedback or followup just one problem after the other .
this product is back at the store within a week .
netgear 's decision to use another company 's tecnology -LRB- zetera , i think -RRB- just makes netgear look bad first of all , i should not have to install a driver to use an external enclosure -LRB- i replaced this with a coolmax nas that had no driver required -RRB- , secondly , the driver i 'm forced to use should actually work .
half of the pcs on my network failed to detect disks and the ones that did detect them only did so intermitantly .
even when the disks were detected , they slowed the file system down causing a delay of up to 10 seconds to open when my computer is clicked the driver formats the drives with a proprietary file system that is not readable by windows -LRB- according to the manual -RRB- so anything you store on them is useless if you get sick of this contraption and get rid of it .
this is a fatal flaw lastly , this file system they used seems to corrupt certain file types .
netgear 's web site mentions this .
the latest version of the driver fixes this for some file types -LRB- such as autocad files -RRB- but others remain .
i found 2 types of files that could not be saved on this machine .
i do not understand how something like this can be released .
all in all , i am sorely disappointed with this machine and with netgear for for putting their good name on it .
i will remember this next time i buy .
the essence of a backup system is that when all goes belly up on your main system , you can recover the data from your backup .
however , the netgear sc101 has some real problems if you use it to mirror -LRB- ie make your data twice as safe -RRB- or span across two disks if you intend to use this device you can expect several problems .
it may drop off your network .
attached drives will disappear , the software will crash and the support you will recieve will be poor and frustrating your last resort is the internet -LRB- netgear removed their online forums -RRB- and you 'll have to resort to using a command line utility to get things working again that is not robust and reliable backup , that is poor product .
this is not a product to be relied upon finally , this solution is very slow and the backup software provided is very buggy .
i backed up 70 gigs of files and it took a whole day with a wireless connection and had to be restarted several times because the drives just kept on detatching check out this site if you 're having problems as it helped me after 6 days of getting nowhere with netgear support .

forret .
com/2006/07 / netgear sc 101 urgent support required / .
i have been an it professional for 22 years , so i am fairly proficient on technical issues but the poor quality of the hardware and service caused me to return the sc101 to the retailer .
when i encountered problems like the drives not spinning down properly , and disappearing partitions , the level 1 technicians had no familiarity with the unit .
i even had to explain the normal , expected behavior to the technician .
he is just reading from a script , and is clearly over his head .
the level 2 technician was not much more help , except to ask me to wait for an upcoming release of new firmware .
i finally purchased a d link dsm g600 and benchmarked the 2 units against each other .
the d link unit vastly outperformed the netgear sc101 .
furthermore , the d link unit exhibited none of the errors experienced by the sc101 , and the d link unit allows standard windows drive mapping and unc addressing , while for some insane reason netgear chose to require proprietary client based software .
netgear had a great idea , but dropped the ball and released a seriously subpar product the old adage you get what you pay for is never more true than with this thing you have to have special software on each pc in order to access the partitioned drives within the unit even with the appropriate software installed , the drive -LRB- s -RRB- within the sc 101 can only be mapped successfully on boot approximately 15 % of the time when you configure the partitions -LRB- drives -RRB- as a shared resource if the drive is not seen by the pc on boot , the software hangs the pc during shutdown -LRB- not a guess , but confirmed via multiple tests -RRB- the performance is horribly slow for a nas device all in all , this is one of most disappointing purchases i 've made the past several years .
i should have done my homework first and read the user reviews on cnet .
there 's a very good reason why the user rating is as low as it is this thing is junk .
the performance is modest at best , has file access issues , can only use select diskdrives -LRB- the list is only found on their website , not packaged with user documentation -RRB- and uses a proprietary disk format .
accidentally deleted files can not be retrieved with utilities from netgear or 3rd party software .
this alone should be reason not to buy this product .
the proprietary format does not offer any advantage that i can see .
customer support is not trained very well and i exchanged email with three different people .
the sc101 nas is poorly designed and does n't work well .
i installed the software on 2 systems and it caused them to run miserably and neither could successfully do a shutdown after loading the software .
the data transfer rate is miserably slow i question if it 's faster than a diskette drive .
the nas drive kept disappearing and sharing did not work on paper , this product reads like the best offering in the market the reality is that it 's a poorly designed , poorly running system .
i 'm an advanced user and i struggled with it .
what do average users do to get this to work .
i 'm returning it to the store after 3 weeks of trying to get it to work .
many problems , really slow on data access .
the product does not have a fan to keep drives cool .
special software required to access the drives other wise not possible .
it 's not a true network drive .
i got one of these .
it worked ok for about 5 months .
today it died .
tech support would not help without paying .
it is also really annoying how every time you go into windows explorer it takes 10 20 seconds for the software to read the drive before you can continue .
in fact this happen in any file dialog , the software has to go out an re read the directory even if you are not going to use anything on the drive .
it also is not cooled well .
i think some hardware died in mine but they would not give me any support unless i paid $ 33 .
i would rather spend the $ 33 on something else at this point .
this is pretty much the same issue i have had with all netgear stuff .
it breaks .
it is not reliable in the long term .
i probably will not buy any more netgear products .
my saga to find an nas that actually works continues .
this looked like the perfect one .
i slapped two 320 gig drives in it , set up the box , and i is good to go the software is excellent allows you to schedule syncs , as well as map this as a drive .
you can even install software on the mapped partition .
of course , after 2 days , it died .
it could no longer be seen on the network .
and eventually it just stopped booting up one $ 100 box , and 2 $ 120 hard drives .
now totally useless a quick glance at the forums shows people with similar problems can not connect to the box , hard drives incompatible , etc .
etc avoid this at all costs it simply does not work .
i am very disappointed with the sc101 product .
i purchased it as a network storage device but in fact it is not .
i purchased this product to hang on a network running tcp/ip using a specific ip address .
however it turns out i have to install the sc101 software on every machine in the network to use this device .
this is not feasible or logical plus on the first two winxp machines i tried to load the software it failed , in fact on one machine i had to do a system restore to get it back up .
if the device would hang on a network at any address with its data mirroring feature it would be very useful but it will not .
i am returning this device to my supplier .
i is thrilled to discover netgear 's new sc101 storage central .
the sc101 is a visually appealing , compact , and quiet dual drive solution but beware .
i purchased the sc101 for features such as drive mirroring , spanning , and ability to accommodate larger hard drives .
the sc101 is reliable but heat causes noticeable and decrease in data access speed confident of the unit s reliability , i placed all of my files on a mirrored pair of 200gb drives .
the mirroring process took 26 hours to create .
it worked flawlessly for a few weeks .
then , i decided to install the latest change the name of the mirror drive from sc101 to toaster following the instructions .
somehow , the drive password is corrupted and all procedural attempts to reset the password failed -LRB- software and button on back of unit -RRB- after several hours , i had two brief but intermittent period of access to data but not long enough to move 100gb of data to another machine in conclusion , netgear 's technical support told me my case is bad and they would call me back .
the guy is nice but never called me back .
i lost 10 years of data with this product and netgear does not seem to care .
beware .
it is a great idea , but the execution is disappointing .
biggest problem is that it is so slow .
transferring a folder to the sc101 takes 4 5 times longer that transferring the same folder to another computer on the network .
it took 32 hours to transfer a 200gb folder from a computer to the sc101 .
it installs as a removable drive instead of a network drive , so every time you turn on your computer , it scans the sc101 looking for autoplay files .
tech support has not responded to my support tickets other than a standard it is being elevated to level 2 support .
i have been waiting 2 weeks for a response .
this product is not ready for prime time yet .
hi , .
after two weeks of use of mirrored two drives one of drives become 0 capacity this is my the last post on netgear support site after week of emails .
11/12/2009 5 18 00 pm .
hi , .
i run z scanplus remvpart 192 .
168 .
xxx and that erased all data from my drives .
fortunately i have backup of all my data before failure as i can see there is no way to resolve problem of one disk failure or failure of really bad sc101 software .
i wanted to use sc101 as secure , mirrored repository of my important data , but after two weeks of use in basic configuration 2 same drives in a mirror it failed i will remove two new hard drives form it and dump sc101 into the garbage where it belongs regards , .
vojin .
there has to be a better product -LRB- i have the sc101t -RRB- .
learn from my mistake and buy something else .
this is not a simple linux board running a little raid set , it is some idiotic specialty language that requires a matching software program on each workstation .
however , it constantly demands that you check if there is a new version which users love to do and then , if your security is so lax as to allow them to install it , it disables those drives and you can not get to them from that machine .
if they are not authorized to make the change , it stops half way and that machine will never be able to connect to that machine worse yet , if you do upgrade the software and do upgrade the firmware to match , it seems to crash -LRB- i is stupid enough to get several , so it is not some random occurrence -RRB- .
then , once it has crashed , you 're finished .
nobody at netgear can help you so , you 'd think , gee , i 'll just pop it in an external usb drive and go .
nope .
that data is held in their little special language that is only readable by their specific version of their specific language wow so , i 'm out about $ 15k from the amount of time my techs have spent beating these things against the wall .
i will never ever buy any netgear products after the experience with this piece of garbage an their utter lack of support once things got difficult if you want a nas drive , get a real nas drive or go buy a damn fileserver with a raid array on it .
you can probably get one off of ebay for less than this thing costs if you include the tech time , you can get a file server and a new car good luck to everyone who has one now .
if i were you , i 'd get my data off of it asap .
where to start .
this product is clearly the first of netgear 's forays into lower priced nass and it shows the software offered no help .
no decisions were clarified for me ; some of my choices were repeatedly questioned netgear 's forums contain quite a few posts about this product , and tho there are some helpful souls trying to solve problems , there are still many folks with unresolved problems .
i wonder how many people did not bother to post their problem .
do not buy this .
total disaster under vista .
disconnects itself , setup is instable , works only once in a while no fun at all i decided to scrap it as i spent too much time troubleshooting .
now i bought a wd my book world edition 1tb and am absolutely happy .
the wd has a web interface -LRB- http \ \ mybookworld -RRB- to do the settings and can be connected to windows using map network drive just stay away from the included mionet software .
after having a hd h250lan by buffalo i is tickled to find a device which i could add my own larger disks to with the sc101 , but what a disapointment when i found out it had to have special software , which is hard to setup and very intermittant operation .
i have not ever gotten it to work properly .
just wich there is an option to just install the cables and run like the buffalo does .
absolutely the worst possible product one can buy .
if you can get it going in the first place , you would get extremely slow read time , close to modem speed write and overheating every few minutes which causes the device to hang .
after a laptop crash i is pissed off that i could n't access my network device from a different laptop .
after spending 2 hours trying to get the firmware and latest version of the drivers i can not attach to the drives where i backed up my data .
i will be trying to recover the data again tomorrow , but at this point i doubt i will have any success .
do not waste your time or money .
complete pos .
my experience with this drive is causing me to dump it and look for a replacement .
to access the drive , one must install proprietary software on ewach and every pc that one intends upon linking to the drive .
i is abvle to link my win2000 and xp machines to the drive .
however , i am still unable to access the drive from windows vista after installing vista on one of my machines 8 months ago .
netgear 's promise of update drivers is still vaporware .
while they may eventually come up with software for vista , they have not announced drivers for either mac or linux as a result i am looking for a nas device that uses a web browser to control and configure the drive -LRB- s -RRB- and uses standard mapping technology to link to the device .
third party software required .
slower than a shared directory on a computer in your network .
spend the extra 129 bucks on a bigger drive and share it from a windows computer oh yeah another sucky thing only windows can use it .
no one in their right mind would buy this if they new all the bs required to use it .
just share a windows drive you can get about 250 gigs for the price of this new paperweight or garage sale item -LRB- to a smuck that is lucky to get tricked at half price instead of the full price i paid for it -RRB- .
do n't do it .
share a drive it is faster .
linux or unix users definitely do not do it not even for 5 bucks .
it is a peace of crap .
worth less than the space it takes up and the gas to bring it home .
although an attractive concept , this device has been very difficult to use for more than a day or two at a time due to significant instability issues .
frequent blue screens prompted me to uninstall several months ago .
a recent firmware update promised fixes , but same problems recurred after reinstalling .
despite direct ethernet wiring , this also frequently failed on long -LRB- 100gb -RRB- backup operations .
would not recommend it .
worth a few more dollars for a more stable unit that is a true nas device .
it just does not work do n't touch this product , look on ebay and see how many are for sale one thing they do not mention in the adverts is that this device uses its own filing system if the device fails you can not take the drives out and pop them into you pc your pc just would not recognise them unless you have a spare device , if you value your data , you would have to buy another in other words you 're hooked .
the only way to avoid this is to keep another backup on a pc somewhere , making it pointless having the sc101 in the first place it is not compatible with some firewalls such as zone alarm you have to power up the sc101 and your networked computers and printers in a particular sequence or you could get problems -LRB- not very good .
for a distributed network attention .
could you all switch off your computers whilst i reboot the sc101 please .
software has to be installed on each computer that is intended to access the device i wasted two weekends trying to get this device working it installed okay , and it managed to update its firmware and software .
i then managed to copy 129 gb to the device ever so slowly -LRB- took over a day to complete -RRB- once i had rebooted , despite all my efforts , rebooting , factory resetting the device , uninstalling the software , -LRB- even the uninstall program crashed .
this would run successfully only after rebooting my machine -RRB- and re installing , my computer never saw the drives again netgear support were appalling firstly , merely quoting paragraphs from their knowledgebase , was not much help asking questions that had already been asked , and already been answered after two weeks of emails , all help dried up , they eventually just ignored my case i lost money and an awful lot of time trying to get this device to work i have over thirty years in it and i gave up miserably i went to maplin and bought two separate normal network enclosures for 40 each , installing took 5 minutes , no drivers , no software , .
they practically fell into place every time i switch on my pc 's they magically appear , no problem at all and they are fast and the filing system is fat32 if you are thinking of buying this device , please read other reviews and beware .
buy it from somewhere you can get your money back it is not fit for it 's intended purpose you have been warned .
for starters it 's the cheapest product in its class .
but it uses its own file system -LRB- ie not ntfs etc -RRB- and each pc needs to be set up to use it , they wont detect it automatically .
the software works on one of my machines , but the others it never seems to attach the drive .
the machine it works on , is good .
the rest , are just beyond me .
i 've done registry changes to no avail .
i should add that i 'm an it professional .
but i think a wiser decision would be to simply buy one of its more expensive competitors , as this is simply not up to the task .
or just add the drives to one or your pcs and use it as a server as i used to do , and about to resume doing .
save yourself the hassle .
i initially had no problems with the unit .
installation seemed somewhat clunky for what should be a simple function .
the unit worked great for about four months until one day it disappeared from the network .
i did the recommended software update and it s been a problem since then i called tech support who fixed the problem -LRB- they told me there is a drive conflict with another application -RRB- .
the next day , in the middle of a large file transfer , the unit decided to disappear .
after rebooting the sc101 , the network and the computer it reconnect after waiting ten minutes for the sc101 to come online .
it still disappears from the network in the middle of file transfers .
i can t trust this unit at all with any critical data .
if anyone has recommendations for reliable nas storage , please please let me know .
if i could score this as a negative 10 , i would do so .
as soon as i started the software installation process , i knew that i would be heading back to the store first , the software install failed to find the up to date software on the netgear servers .
i did not think this would be a problem until i decided to check the netgear support site where i found a strong admonition to get the new software and new firmware and avoid using the software shipped with the product .
if the new software were so important , i would think that they would ship it with the product .
additionally , the support site stated that the up to date software fixed ` most ' of the bugs , but there is at least one bug that would require occasional re booting of the pc .
is not that great next , the install process installed some drivers on my pc .
drivers to talk to a nas box .
what about good old tcp/ip and a local application .
this is not a good sign for being able to use this with a linux box or my mac/os x finally , the configuration software is able to see only one of the two installed drives that is it .
back to the store for a refund in under an hour .
this device looks good on paper but fails to meet the advertised capability once you connect it to your lan you have to fiddle around to get the pc to see the disk in the config utility .
i had to reboot my router 3 times before the pc saw the disks once configured it took nearly 24 hours to copy my home photo directories to it .
in contrast archiving to dvd rom takes around 10 to 30 mins why so long .
the transfer speed over the network only achieves 1 mbit/sec save your money and buy an icy box nas2000 b or similar .
these are full network file server in a box and are as fast as any normal windows file share .
who ever reviewed this product at cnet should be fired .
this is a usless product an external usb drive would do a better job at what this claims it can do .
your first clue should be that the install program says to say ok -LRB- bypass -RRB- all the xp warning messages .
my harddrive crashed four days ago -LRB- complete mechanical failure -RRB- fortunately i had years of my important data backed up to the sc101 i ended up buying a new vista pc because my old one is 5 years old .
i tried installing the sc101 software , but windows vista refused to install it i had to buy a new harddrive for the old pc and a new usb external drive install the old pc with xp and the sc101 software to transfer to the new usb external drive so i could then selective pull the files to my new vista pc the life lesson here is never never never compromise and use proprietary hardware / software / file formats especially because of price i first learned this many years ago when i bought a radio shack tandy 286dx -LRB- no longer in business -RRB- and then later with an ibm -LRB- now lenovo -RRB- .
a network drive is a very appealing option , especially for $ 100 but you should always remember you get what you pay for spend the money and get the $ 500 windows compatible drive format hardware otherwise get the cheaper usb maxtor , wd , or seagate drives they are compatible with any windows pc xp or vista i am sending my sc101 to computer hell the garbage dump .
information on the box is intentionally vague .
it can not use any size hard drive .
the list of compatible hard drives is very small .
it can not be viewed from separate subnets .
it requires software to be installed on each and every pc that accesses it .
it uses a proprietary file system that reformats the hard drives .
in case of a disaster you 're out of luck terribly slow transfer speeds .
files are protected from entire pc 's not user based security .
i tried and tested multiple hard drives , different software versions and different configurations .
none of which worked .
netgear customer support is traditionally horrendous it uses tcp/ip but is not ip based .
the vital instructions vary from link to link on their own website .
they require for you restart each and every single network device on your network whenever the storage center loses connection with the network .
which it frequently does occasionally prone to blue screen inducing problems just do a search for this product and you 'll find plenty to rant about .
perhaps they 'll get it right the next time around i guess i 'll have to wait for windows home server .
this is my second netgear product i bought -LRB- previously a wireless modem which i is only okay with not impressed -RRB- the idea of a network storage appeals to me .
but this drive just is not good in reading the previous reviews i found that it is a finicky thing , and be careful on the drives you buy for it .
well i searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well , but that is where everything started to go down hill .
midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages -LRB- which turn out to be things like this is untested on xp and might not work kind of errors -RRB- and suddenly my computer reboots .
figured it would have told me it is going to do so oh well , and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot .
tried again , same thing happens .
started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the sc101 , you need to look in to your own computer .
to quote netgears web site , scsi disk drivers from the promise company conflict with the sc101 device drivers .
promise drivers are typically used for raid 1 or for sata drives .
many newer computers use promise sata drivers .
my computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers .
back in the box the sc101 goes , and i try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me .
tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests , and none work .
this is where i get really frustrated , netgear support .
i waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone , who ultimately told me it is my own fault and i 'd have to pay to have that cr p , yes he said it , from my system .
i needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill .
i have to pay to get this junk off my computer .
way to support your products netgear .
the tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that is hard to understand , and went through huge mood swings during the call , from happy , to argumentative , to depressed , to happy again .
i is freaked that this person knew my home address .
all in all , this is a great concept .
after reading up on it and now experiencing it , i think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market .
maybe by a company with better customer service .
it really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer .
this is a tempting device .
it 's small , carries two drives , uses dhcp too bad it stops working after a few months .
it works just long enough to put important things on it , then the drives just go away .
good luck dealing with netgear tech support .
even the call center you pay for -LRB- pay . -RRB-
lacks basic technical knowledge your disks will be formatted using netgear 's proprietary format , so you can not retrieve the data by putting your drives in another device .
data go poof .
i bought this new with two brand new 200 gig hard drives and set it up with drive mirroring to back up the data automatically .
this worked great for about a week .
then drives would disappear from one computer , but be visible from another computer .
i tried all the fixes noted on the netgear website and the only thing that worked is editing the registry and re installing the drives .
that fixed the problem for a week or two , then a drive would mysteriously vanish from another computer .
the last straw is when all the information mysteriously vanished from one of the drives and the netgear utilities were not able to recover any data despite the fact that the drives were mirrored .
this product operates on a totally different file structure than windows , so without the provided software , there is absolutely no way to access or recover lost files .
included software buggie .
drivers buggie .
software is somewhat intrusive to entire system .
you never know if the device is going to load at startup .
frequently have to restart device for computers to log on .
frequent lock up during large file transfers .
not ready for prime time .
i bought this product so i wouldnt need any additional wires all over the house ; i installed the software to only find lots of problems ; the software is a pain to install ; when you click on help all types of errors come up .
i called support waited 20 minutes on the phone only to hear thank you someone will call you back in 1 hour .
i installed the software on my first system it appeared to function .
so i installed the software on one of my laptops .
it locked that system up .
i then tried installing the software on another one of my laptops , it locked up as well .
then the first computer started malfunctioning .
uninstalling the software is just as bad .
it took several reboots and lots of ctrl alt del to access the task manager to manually get out of the junk software .
i do not recommend this product at all .
i would like to return it , but the box is already on it 's way to the landfill .
junk .
, junk .
, junk .
can not get this to work , called tech support , first time got disconnected without speaking to anyone , second time waited about half an hour just to get recording telling me to leave my name and number .
this is the first and last piece of netgear junk i 'll ever buy , product does not work , software does not work and no support from netgear .
i hope i can return it .
i own it .
horrible , unreliable , overheating problem .
i have two 400 gb hdd and i have them mirrored , the mirror breaks every week .
simple question , what good it is to have a backup system , if the backup system itself is more unreliable than the backed up unit itself .
i have to delete all partitions and re create it and backup everything .
it takes about 16 hours to backup 140 gb .
it constantly loses connection to connected hosts .
i presume if you only use 1 hdd in it it might work , but then it is an overkill , i would rather use an external hdd .
i switched back to my custom built computer .
i can not efford ibm 's $ 5000 storage units .
do not waste your money .
garbage .
netgear admits the problems i -LRB- and others -RRB- are describing and their website says a resolution will become available in the future just like others have said here read the troubleshooting page at netgear .
com and it tells you all of the bugs i am about to describe 1 -RRB- blue stop screen every few minutes .
the hard drive drivers are not compatible with the ones on windows xp .
during the installation of the sc101 windows tells you the drivers are untested and will cause your computer to become unstable 2 -RRB- hard drives drop off of the network frequently -LRB- like every half hour -RRB- and require you to restart your router , modem , the sc101 and your computer 3 -RRB- hard drives also lose their drive letter and can not be accessed from your desktop and they must be reformatted if you can not detach and reattach them i am not exaggerating when i make these statements you can read for yourself at netgear 's sc101 support page .
all of the trouble shooting items they list are real and will happen to you too because this product is pure garbage .
i have an sc101 with two 200gb maxtor disks .
after several days of trying , i have n't been able to create mirrored partitions .
i have tried to vary several parameters , like the partition size , shared vs .
not shared , password protected vs .
not password protected , it does n't matter , the mirroring process always hangs .
and it is not that i have not been patient .
on one occasion i left the mirroring process run for seven hours before i killed it i have contacted netgear for support .
so far , none of their suggestions has worked i 'm a software engineer by profession and after having dealt with the sc101 configuration i wonder if this product is ever tested or debugged it will be very hard for me to ever consider putting another netgear product on my network .
the short version the sc101 is one of the worse products i ever bought .
the long version .
after reading the review in toms networking -LRB- tn -RRB- i thought i would get a decent working nas .
i did not expect miracles and realized that it is not the fastest nas on the block .
after all it is a rather cheap unit the first problem is installing the zetra driver .
it worked on my xp machine but not on a win2k .
it complained about a missing driver .
after some google ing i realized that i is not alone with this problem .
after a few attempts it finnaly worked .
what i did is installing the older driver that came with the unit .
after that i could update to the latest version the sc101 has 2x320gb disc installed .
i mirrored 200gb and have 2 other partitions of 100 gb each .
here is another problem .
i thought i read that one partition could span over multiple physical drives , but i couldn t find a way of doing it .
an earlier post mention along mirroring time , but for me i believe it took less then 10 min quote from tn .
its single user performance is pretty good , too , being close enough to c drive speeds that many people may not notice the difference is that a joke or .
indeed i got a similar read and write speed as tn , but the 2500kb write speed on the mirrored discs are painfully slow .
i manage to stream music if i m alone on the lan , but video gets jerky and don t even think of streaming hd video material .
back to the win2k machine .
even if the installation of the driver worked fine .
it is very difficult to be able to attached the partitions i already created .
a few reboot later of both pcs and nas and i finally manage to see the drives now the sygate firewall i had installed really didn t like the sc101 .
it show every second minute sintrusions from drives and tries to block the sintruder .
if i temporary disable sygate , then i can access the drives if you open up explorer and click on smy computer , then the whole pc freezes for around 30 sec .
this happen on both of my machines .
not only that also periodically the pc freezes up .
even if you e .
are listing to a mp3 which is stored on the c drive , the music interrupts for a brief moment which is very annoying .
if i stop the service szetetaservice , then this problem disappear .
the same problem exists for both xp and win2k occasionally zetera uses around 35 % cpu load -LRB- p4 2 .
4ghz , 1hb ram -RRB- for a while -LRB- ~ 1 min -RRB- .
this is without doing anything towards the nas forget to scan your drives with norton antivirus .
it will probably take weeks .
i say probably as i gave up after 3 days of scanning .
indeed you can see that stotal scan files increase , but this with around 1 files per min .
i don t know what the problem is .
there is no high cpu load and no network activity not only this , during the scan , no other pc on the lan can be used as they completely freezes up .
and the worst problem ; i would like to use the sc101 as a boat anchor , as it seems to be the only good purpose of it .
but before that as i can t use the drives in another nas , i first need to buy 640gb of space to copy over my stored data , before i can reformat the old drives .
i have used several nas drives and found the sc101 to be the worst the unit requires a dhcp to be present and on the network .
you can not manually assign static ip 's .
the unit grabs multiple ip 's at each bootup .
the utility program is propriorty and bulky .
i have had all of the drives just drop off the network and disapear randomly .
i have had to use the command line utility three times now to recover partitions and lost drives .
after several hours of command line reinstatements i have chosen not to keep any data on the unit .
it just disappears and reappears whenever it feels like it .
partly to blame because of the ip polling .
i would not recommend this unit and have found it scary at best for data storage firewalls see the netgear website and have fun sincerely , .
very dissapointed user .
normally i read cnet user comments before buying any tech gadget , not sure why i did not with this purchase .
nothing but problems .
the software wizard does not delete drives properly ; creating a mirror took over 12 hours .
with all the problems , how can i save my files to this unit with confidence .
and what is this , you need software to access the disk .
it 's supposed to be network attached storage not software attached storage .
read all the reviews and stay away from this product .
i 'd give it a zero if i could .
i have spend countless hours wrestling with this product .
everything worked intitially , but over time the drives drop out and become inaccessible .
ican no loner access then 600ggs of data that i have loaded into it .
this product has been a real nightmare netgear pulled it 's sc101 forum offline because of all of the negative postings do not buy this product .
these people have no shame .
this product has been out almost a year and still is buggy .
good thing i ghost my pc before installing the scm software .
i think this software trashed the window registery and shot my os config on the pc .
had to reimage the drive .
tried a couple of times and same problem , so i gave up .
i feel like murdering someone at netgear .
this product is not fit for purpose .
it gets much too hot for the welfare of hard disks and itself .
my problems did n't start until about a week after installing the scm software .
i did one good backup from two network pcs .
soon after that my pcs started acting funny .
they would intermittently get very sluggish or freeze , requiring a reboot after a forced power down .
in addition , they would n't power down when windows shut down .
all this is intermittent and did n't happen on both pcs at the same time .
after a couple of weeks of fiddling with windows and searching the net for solutions , i discovered the network drives did n't show in windows explorer .
i had n't looked for them in maybe two weeks because i is so busy trying to get the pcs working properly again .
to make a long agonizing story , i finally began with a fresh install on one of the computers .
it worked for a while , even after i reinstalled the scm software -LRB- but i made no backups for a while -RRB- .
then i did a fresh reinstall of windows on the second pc .
before i is done with that took three days the first pc started acting up again .
and i discovered i still could not see the network drive on either pc .
so i contacted netgear support , but unfortunately it is already more than three months since i 'd bought the damned device , so i settled for email support .
useless .
two more months of going nuts , until it suddenly came to me in a flash that all my problems were being caused by the scm software .
i uninstalled it on both pcs and immediately all my troubles were over .
i 'm sure i can not get my money back by now , but i 'll live with that .
i am pretty sure the problems are caused by the unsigned drivers the netgear cd installs .
it does n't work for xp media center or vista and they have no intention of changing that their web based support is the worst i 've ever seen .
i can hardly even find how to get product support without paying them money from my experience with this product , i would not buy anything netgear makes .
i have not been this disappointed by something in a long time .
wow .
the netgear storage central is bad , really bad .
it does all kinds of terrible things .
it slows my network down and all the machines connected to them .
it checks out for no reason , removes itself from the network and you have to unplug it , reboot and if you are very lucky it will show back up .
it is not at all like a true network server as it requires software to be installed on every computer that uses it and the software sucks .
i think it 's very slow compared to server storage and very very slow compared to a slave drive .
they very boldly lie when they state on the box and everywhere else that you can use any hard drive in the storage central , you simply can not .
the storage central is a piece of junk that should not have been released to the public and netgear should not have claimed that it does things it does not .
i smell a class action on this one .
i 've had mine for a week .
gave it my best shot and tried to stay positive despite what i read here and everyplace else but it 's going back to the store now .
the comments on this device are all true ; it really is a piece of junk .
i can not believe that netgear released this to the public .
the first thing , when i tried to slide the hard drive into the toaster the metal strain relief tab holding the power cable secure inside the toaster is not bent back to where it is supposed to be .
had i not noticed this , stopped and bent it into place first before forcing it , it would have removed the components off my hard drive 's pcb my second problem is partially my fault .
the hard drive you choose to put in the sc101 should be empty .
-LRB- and it can not be just any hard drive as it clearly states on the box -RRB- you can not just put a hard drive full of data in and expect it to work , although you should be able to .
after you install your drive it will format your hard drive to it 's own special file system without specifically warning you all data will be gone forever -LRB- but i should have known -RRB- and so if it 's not empty you can kiss everything good bye .
i did that .
it seems the engineers at netgear did n't think someone might have a very large hard drive in their machine already that they might want to use for this purpose it also falls asleep and if you 're lucky takes 15 seconds or longer to wake up when you click on the drive letter in explorer .
if you 're not lucky then you will have to reach behind the toaster and unplug it , then plug it back in , it will re boot for a minute or two and you are up and running for a short time last night i is moving data to the toaster and halfway into it got an error message that it could n't continue .
upon searching the toaster is nowhere to be found .
again , stop everything , unplug the thing and plug it back in and wait it slows everythng else down on my computer .
i do n't like the fact that it requires third party software to operate , it should not .
why can not you just plug it in .
the software is running all the time , robbing resources and the zone alarm program shows network activity even when you 're not doing anything the bottom line , it 's really cute .
other than that there 's not much there .
wait until they get the bugs worked out or buy something else .
although i have not looked for an alternative yet , i will start today .
i love this idea and am desperate need of a product that fills this functional need .
unfortunately , i could not even get it running .
when i first installed and ran the client software it told me my sc101 needed a firmware upgrade , from version 4 .
0 to 4 .
i tried to do it , but the storage central manager crashes in the middle of each upgrade attempt .
when i skip the upgrade and just try to create drives for my installed disks , it fails telling me it is unable to format the disks .
no reason given customer support is well intentioned but completely unable to resolve the issue .
any glowing reports here i assume must come from netgear shills .
in the netgear product support forum there are loads of people like me who spent hours trying to work through the bugs , only to give up and return the device .
not for the faint of heart .
this storage sits on the network , picks up an ip from dhcp , yet , you can not mount it directly .
what gives .
you need an application/drivers installed on a windows box in order to use this via osx or linux , you need to share the folder from your windows box , then mount it .
stupid and inefficient why not just make it mountable on its own .
it would also just stop responding on my network ; both wirelessly and to other machines on the same switch mounts would drop for no reason like they say , you get what you pay for junk i will be returning this to best buy asap .
though this looked like a good deal .
just pop in a couple of cheap ide drives and hang it on the network .
like all nas i know , however , you need software running on your windows network to access and manage these drives .
this is this units achilles heal , at least in my implementation .
i dropped a couple 300 gb seagate drives and began the software installation .
it choked at least once during installation .
i should have forseen the coming omen after struggling through the restarted installation , i could access the drives , for a short while .
after a few hours they disappeared and nothing seemed to want to recover them .
after eventuall deinstalling and reinstalling , recreating -LRB- which would have destroyed all data on the drives -RRB- i got drives working again .
then the same happened .
the management software hangs virtually every time i try and use it to reattach drives and if you ever succeed to delete the unatachable drive the space is still consumed and unavailable i think when if i ever get it working i will use it to store all my important , irreplaceable , can not lose data .
overall a very poor performer .
this unit did not like my new wd 250gb drives , maxtor ata133/200gb were ok as long as you did not try to use the raid function .
repeated attempts failed with new identical drives .
once failed attempt occurs the drive has less capacity than before and there is no utility to get it back .
i did finally get one 50gb drive shared and mirrored after many failed attempts does anyone reading this think i will ever put my data on this drive .
if so i have some swamp land for you .
and did you know that if the sc101 fails you can not insert the drives in a usb or ide carrier to retrieve your data .
well check the users guide well before you buy this one .
do not say you were not warned .
i joined cnet just to report on this piece of junk .
netgear if your reading i 'm returning my unit to the store in the morning .
in conclusion i gave this unit a rating of 1 because i believe if you use it you will lose the very data which you are purchasing a reliable storage device to protect .
the unit loses connection , password reset works erratically at best , phone support unhelpful .
spent hours in the forum , and resetting the network , computers and storage unit with unpredicatble results .
the concept is neat , but the implementation dismal .
stay away from this as far as you can .
i have been trying to install one for the last 48 hours .
i am using an 250gb hitashi hard drive with it .
so far , it can only find 31gb out of the 250 .
called support 3 times .
still no answer despite 24 hour guaranteed answer .
one of my worst experience of 2005 .
btw it needs software installed on every pc that will connect to it .
there 's more holes in this product than swiss cheese too bad they did n't add a fan to let some of the hot air out of this sham product .
storage central sc101 .
lacks in the following areas .
cool product but still needs quite a bit of work lacks physical security no key lock to lock drives inside unit .
-LRB- this wo not work in an office environment jack a $ $ .
no kingston hole in the back to cable strap this unit to the desk like a laptop over heats drives -LRB- no cooling fan -RRB- uses a proprietary hd format -LRB- not fat32 nor ntfs -RRB- .
can not access the drives from the net , no ip addressing to drives .
looks good but no thanks .
you people should be b slapped for putting a bogus product on the market .
those sorry fools that purchase this product will be jacked .
it simply does not do what is supposed to maybe the firmware is immature or the managing software is not there yet , who knows who 's fault it is , certainly not mine i paied real money to buy an excercise in broken modern electronics on a more technical level i think the fault lies in the way it requires more than one ip address to the dhcp server when it has only one mac address , so the dhcp server screws up i will consder my money as money spent to support people working at netgear , like giving half an euro at the guy who washes your screen at the traffic light .
only hope the boss does not buy a porsche as far as i am concerned will not be frauded again by this company .
netgear coud go down the sink and hope so .
i like the fact that its small and you can place a hard drive in it real easily but thats it i dont like the fact that after 30 minutes of use that my hard drives were red hot coming out of the sc101 .
that will kill a hard drive in no time at all .
if they designed it with a 80 mm fan this would not be a problem .
you must place drives that can be formated .
if you have data drives already , dont use this machine .
you have to format your drive before using it on the network .
hope nobody accidentally formats a drive with tons of data on it like i almost did .
and who cares about mirroring a drive because before you can replace the drive the other drive might die from all the heat .
also this unit is made to run 24/7 .
the drives wont make the first week .
bought two .
one for home , one for the office .
both had glitches during setup .
mirrored drives took a long time to format .
one partition dissapeared and i had to delete it and start over -LRB- before i had data on it -RRB- .
i should have stopped then .
after deploying both and switching the office to the sc101 , a day later the main mirrored partition became unallocated and unrecoverable .
we lost a full day of changes in a five person office .
at about 40 hours to deploy and about 40 hours worth of lost work , this episode should not be replayed by anyone lucky enough to read my review .
i hope i can get buy .
com to take them back .
save your money .
check out the netgear support forums -LRB- http / / forum1 .
netgear .
com/support browse through the ` network storage ' forums -RRB- .
here you can read through literally hundreds of posts from frustrated purchasers of this piece of junk .
i think they just simply have not worked out any of the bugs yet .
i am shocked that netgear would even release a product so buggy .
i am a systems/network professional and i find myself running into all the same problems as the other folks in the forums take my advice do not buy this product .
i wish someone had told me this .
this product only works with window systems which need custom drivers to handle the proprietary/non standard protocals .
thus it will not work with mac os x , linux , or other systems .
very frustrating .

absolutely nothing. ; Once it crashes -LRB- and it will -RRB- you are toast .
NOBODY , not even after spending over $ 500 on NETGEAR support AND sending it out to them ... .
NOBODY can recover that data .
Less Price ; 1 .
It took me 2 months to install .
Every time i try to install got different error messages . .
2 .
After successful install , i try to copy 1.5 GB and it says 36 hours to copy the files from my Desktop to SC101 .
$ $ $ = Who could resist a SAN solution for less than $ 39 -LRB- Before Drives -RRB- . .
Footprint = Perfect for small office environment - the `` Toaster '' is cute !
; Configuration `` not for the faint at heart '' .
Documentation on Netgear website is lacking .
FORTUNATELY - users provide good troubleshooting information - via Google - that solved issues . .
Performance = unit is not speedy BUT for $ 29 it is GREAT !!!!! Attaches to your router and lets you access your vids , pics , and music from anywhere. ; Windows only , no LINUX support , No ability to defrag drive -LRB- s -RRB- as uses a non-windows file structure .
Easy to use for non-techies like me ; helpful for cleaning up electronics clutter and keeping everything stored safely in one place. ; Have n't really found any yet - have n't had the box for too long .
Setup is easy ; Software completely unstable .
Every machine on the network gets a blue screen with a Bad _ Pool _ Caller message very often .
Laptops on the network , you get a blue screen when coming out of hibernate .
Netgear is aware but not interested in fixing issues .
no pros this product does not work in a reliable fashion ; everything .
consider it as money spent to support a company that should not be operating The idea .
Price .
Then again its just a paper-weight. ; Although it can be painfully slow , the killer here is its not reliable .
Often need to reboot the router to get the PC to see the drive again .
Works for a few days or a week or two then the drive just disappears .
Unit gets very hot .
The unit and its accessories are packaged nicely .
The NAS itself looks rather like a friendly toy toaster .
Other than the loosely-fitting drive door , it seems well-made. ; The hardware installation went well .
Installing the software , not so much . .
The sparsely-worded manual offered no help .
I spent hours poring over the Netgear forums and never getting the unit to work .
File Sharing , Mirroring &#38; Spanning for all those movies , pictures and stuff I do n't want to keep on my computer 's hard drive .
Fast , efficient , easy to install and everyone in the family can share. ; I spend too much time reorganizing my files - now that I have a great network storage box My scenario is having old IDE drives that are not being used for anything else , and having a Windows Home Server that is on 24/7 for my home network .
I somehow managed to get the required driver software running on Windows Home Server to share them. ; Where do I begin ?
1.5 star average user rating says a lot .
Place the blame SQUARELY on the `` Zetera '' company who has basically abandoned further development on the required driver software , and a bit of blame on Netgear for not stepping up to fix it .
Nice idea , great case and ventilation and power supply looks healthy enough to do the job. ; Does n't work as advertised .
The software is buggy on my XP PC , The front opening is clever but not all that easy to get back on .
Small , Cheap NAS Solution .
Works Great if you have a good base in computers .
Will Work with Vista , Will Work Solid only if firmware updates are done .
Will Host and work as a Movie Server. ; Transfer Time Makes This Unit Almost Useless .
Even on a Giga-Network .
The unit is easily one tenth as fast as a USB External drive .
I have two 250 GB drives .
It has taken 16 Hours to add 450Gb of Data Works great when you get the updates for it .
Every computer can be configured to share this drive and more than one computer can access it simultaneously. ; Had to download updated software for it to work properly with wireless computers .
It kept dropping and finding the drives like being caught in a loop .
