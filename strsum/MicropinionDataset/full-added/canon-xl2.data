listening to the whiners complaining about stupid issues about this camera got me off the couch and writing  .
this camera utterly rocks  .
sure , in a few ( few spelled more like four or more years when the whole hd thing shakes out it will not be the ultimate hot tamale it is today) regardless , if you want an amazing automatic video camera with ultimate manualy control there is no equal  .
period  .
this camera produce lucious video and audio  .
yup , you can buy a less expensive camera and achieve quasi    similar results  .
quasi    semi    sucks  .
or you can step up and get the real deal  .
go ahead , write about what a canon    head i must be or whatever  .
i own no stock in canon  .
i do not work for them  .
they just make amazing video cameras    several of which i own .
this is a great camera until today now i have to send it in to have work done on it and it is only six days old  .
the store i bought it from would not let me exchange it because i cut part of the box out for the rebate , so now i get to seat around for a month before i get my camera back  .
other then that this is a wonderful camera , and out performs all other cameras in its class .

the canon xl2 is designed for the experienced videographer , so getting the image you need isnt the easiest thing to accomplish  .
you got to take time and learn the features manipulate the settings to create perfection  .
ofcourse , the image doesnt look much different than other prosumer cams shooting at 24p right out the box , but once you turn the gain knobs , run the white balance adjust the settings , you are dealing with something really powerful  .
alot of xl2 users complain about not getting the best image quality for paying $5 , 000 , and i dont blame them because i is the same when i first started shooting with mine  .
as a video maker , you must know how to assign your equiptment to different areas for example , i use the xl2 for music videos , short films anything else that needs to be shot with great detail it also works good for live events like concerts and protesting marches  .
now for home videos documentaries sony's dcr2100 can do the job  .
if you have an xl2 and want the best quality ever , expiriment dont be afraid to move knobs and change settings plus , with a little color correction on your nle system you will be suprised at how dope the xl2 can be  .
if you are not into working with settings , light systems , etc just wanna turn on your cam and shoot , i recomend something more user friendly  .
the xl2 can get real heavy accesories do costs alot , but if you are gonna spend $5 , 000 for the camcorder in the first place , you should know what you are getting into you cant by a ferrari for $200 , 000 get a flat expect to buy a set of tires for cheap  .
im only 19 years old i have never been to school for film , but i have some experience believe me when i say that it shouldnt be up to the camcorder to produce great video , it should be up to the person behind the camcorder to make great video  .
got questions  .

this camera is the way to go , if you love to shoot live steam train's from the 1940's  .
i use it all the time shooting a pere marquette 2    8    4 berkshire no  .
1225 in owosso michigan it captures good sound videos' great when the weather is fair [edited by   admin]  .
overall i had some choices of choosing from sony , panasonic and canon  .
i decided to go with the canon even though it is spendy , but im happy with my choice and would do the same again  .
anyone considering a panasonic over xl2 , i would highly reviese , mostly because the panasonic lens is crap compared to the xl2 .
the canon xl2 is a fantastic non    hd system that's perfect for entry    level professional videography .
i use this camera for indie productions and i find it at a very high level , the definition is definitely brilliant but the contrast and color are not as good as panasonic  .
although it has interchangeable optics which make it unique in its way the controls over image and color are semi professional it is understandable that , due to the optics , the price is definitely higher than panasonic but the results in image quality are a bit lower another point of discuss is the unease of use and handling the design is in my opinion excellent .
there's no doubt that this is a great camera , i had the pleasure of using it for 2 weeks before giving it up  .
there were some issues that i had with this camera , first of all and my main concern is that the lcd viewfinder is not the best for finding you focus point , this can be frustrating at times knowing that this camera has the best lense for focusing ability  .
there is also no separate pop    out lcd , so inorder to correct this problem , you will need to add a monitor somewhere on the camera (on top mount or on sled/stabilizer) this increases weight and cost  .
another great option for the viewfinder is to purchase the optional evf monochrome viewfinder ; this would be ideal to use with an additional 4 + mounted lcd (as this viewfinder eliminates the standard evf's flip    up lcd screen) but this comes at a heavy price tag of $1500  .
the iris control is a step system , which is noticable when using and not fluid this camera has great options if you want to pay for them , no doubt a great choice for any pro or amature film maker , great for event shooting , but would take some getting used to for artistic shooting recommended  .
well , i've been using dv since its inception , and have an educational background in broadcasting and comp    sci  .
the canon offerings have always offered unique and useful features , including this xl2 , but simply can not compare to sony's offerings in the same category  .
the sony vx2100 (consumer) / pd170 (pro) , offers a substantially superior image  .
the image is not oversharpened like it is on the xl series , and offers cleaner results with better color reproduction  .
to top it off the xl2 is only 5  .
5 lux min rated , which is very poor , and not suitable for professional use  .
it's okay for home use , but the lux rating (for those of you that do not know) is the measurement used to define how sensitive the imager is  .
the lower the rating , the less light required to generate a decent picture  .
in most indoor venues (homes , restaurants , bars , churches , etc  .
) the lighting is not enough to generate a decent picture on a greater    than    4 lux camera without lots of gain , which introduces substantial noise to the image  .
the sony vx2100 , in contrast , is priced about $1000 less , and is rated at a far superior 1 lux (natively , not with digital enhancement) which means that indoor shooting is very natural with no additional lighting to lug around , and without the introduction of noise due to higher gain requirements  .
overall , the sony prosumer line (vx2100/pd170) is a substantially better offering  .
the only advantage to the xl2 is the interchangeable lens system , which is really not that useful unless you have a very specific need  .
for most uses , a standard lens with telephoto , wide , and anamorphic adapters are more than enough if you need to add lens capability  .
for widescreen shooters , the sony offerings can utilize a manual focus pulling anamorphic adapter by century optics which really makes the interchangeable lens system of the xl2 a nicety rather than a necessity .
disappointing  .
when you need your client the tape (s) you recorded with the xl2 you know there's going to be trouble  .
it seems canon failed to produce a camera that complies with the strictest dv standards .
so , i purchased an rca cc9390 in 2001 for $499 i is very pleased with the camera and i always drooled when i saw the canon xl2 hoping that i would someday own a camera like that in 2005 i did some green screen shooting with my rca cc9390 and the results were not good , but they were ok , they worked and my boss loved them  .
amazing that it worked at all considering the lighting is horrendous and the camera is cheap i started getting more clients wanting more greenscreen filming , so i purchased the canon xl2 and did some light green screen stuff also with some bad lighting  .
the results were a tiny bit better than before with the rca  .
i thought maybe just because of the poor lighting  .
later , i purchased a whole bunch of professional lighting equipment allowing me to evenly light the greenscreen and my subject using keylights , fill lights , and backlights , etc  .
i is very excited to see the results with my xl2 , but to my dismay , the results were no better than before  .
i pulled out my rca cc9390 and got the same results  .
the same results  .
i started tweaking around with different features on the xl2 to see if i could get a little better color , but no  .
my green screen still showed up very dull and my baby blue shirt is still gray  .
there could be something that i'm missing , but there's no excuse for my $4 , 000 canon xl2 to behave like my $400 rca cc9390 the verdict  .
the canon xl2 is merely a $400 camera with a $1200 lens .
i bought a canon digital camcorder three years ago  .
it stopped working after recording around 10 hours worth of tape  .
we dont use it often and once it stopped working (in the middle of my daughters recital  .
) and i is too busy to devote all day to gettting it fixed  .
when i finally took it back to best buy , they wouldnt even send it in to be fixed unless you buy their inflated service contract and canon wants $150 to even look at it  .
when you add up the cost of the camera and the repair , that comes to around $65 an hour for the taping i did with it i will never buy another canon product , or shop at best buy again and i suggest you do the same  .
terrible product and terrible customer service  .
dont stand for it  .
if enough people complain , something might get done  .
if anything , we need to see their sales fall so someone , somewhere starts to wonder why .
Where to start - optics - looks - controls - duh!; Would be great if they were free but that's just un-American.
Changeable optics, resolution,true native 16/9; Unease of handling, not as many controls as Panasonic AG-DVX 100AE
Pro Design &#38; Expandability; Audio XLR ports; Telephoto standard Lens with stabilization; LCD/Eyepeice, IRIS control, Weight (in some cases)! Low light grain, Price for Expansion!
24p, 16:9 ratio, inerchangable lens system, great professional features.; low internal illumination, expensive accesories, heavy as hell.
Intercangable lenesInterchangeable lenses, Image control, 4 audio channels; Size, Cost, Ergonomics are a little strange, cant adjust shoulder rest.
Interchangeable lens system is fabulous; Lower quality imagery than can be had for less money
Great camera to shoot off the shoulder. Easy operation. Good picture quality.; - Tapes recorded with this camera can't be played back in a Sony environment This is due to an alignment issue (internal mechanics).. - Cannot record signal of both front mic and mic connected via XLR at the back.
Video quality, 24p works well, great manual controls, changable lenses, xlr microphone, true 16 by 9, great audio controls; Not as good as actual film or HD (best dv aroundthough), LCD is very poor
