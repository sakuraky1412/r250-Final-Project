in the last two years i have stayed several times here and generally i have been pretty pleased with this hotel and i have considered it one of the examples of a proper airport/business traveller hotel .
unfortunately my last visit was a kind of partial disappointment .
steigenberger is located 15 minutes drive with a shuttle from the schiphol airport and the access to the highway is pretty convenient too .
the rooms are generally spacious and even though you might experience the typical `` business coldness '' when it comes to furniture , the quality of bed , pillows and overall amenities is excellent .
very positive remarks could be made also for the breakfast and the hotel restaurant .
on the negative side , the parking is not free for guests of the hotel ( which is a disadvantange in comparison to other hotels in this segment in this area ) .
in addition to this , what partially disappointed me this time , was the worn-out and badly maintained parts of my room .
the window curtains were with stains/burns and this was clearly visible ( see pictures ) and the bathroom was not properly maintained .
i was surprised by this as i never experienced these issues when previously staying at this hotel .
for a hotel of this class , i find these issues unacceptable .
still i will give the hotel one more chance in the future and i hope that was a single case of poorly maintained room , because in any case this . . .
