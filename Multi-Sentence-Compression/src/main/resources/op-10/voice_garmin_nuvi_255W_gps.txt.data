VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .
Voice commands were mechanical but clear .
The voices seem too robotic .
You have your choice of several languages and voices .
However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .
The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .
0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !
It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .
Some of the voices are annoying .
