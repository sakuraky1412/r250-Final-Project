the/DT westin/NN astir/NN palace/NN is/VBZ in/IN a/DT fabulous/JJ location/NN on/IN a/DT peninsula/NN just/RB outside/JJ athens/NNS ./.

right/RB next/JJ to/TO it/PRP is/VBZ the/DT arion/NN resort/NN ,/, also/RB operated/VBN by/IN starwood/NN under/IN the/DT luxury/NN collection/NN brand/NN ;/: both/CC hotels/NNS are/VBP within/IN a/DT private/JJ compound/NN and/CC entered/VBN through/IN a/DT gate/NN with/IN a/DT guard/NN ./.

the/DT hotels/NNS sit/VBP in/IN beautiful/JJ grounds/NNS overlooking/VBG the/DT sea/NN ./.

the/DT vouliagmeni/NNS area/NN is/VBZ an/DT upmarket/JJ suburb/NN of/IN athens/NNS and/CC there/EX are/VBP several/JJ expensive/JJ restaurants/NNS just/RB outside/IN the/DT hotel/NN complex/NN ./.

there/EX is/VBZ a/DT small/JJ supermarket/NN about/IN 5/CD minutes/NNS drive/VBP from/IN the/DT hotel/NN at/IN the/DT junction/NN with/IN the/DT main/JJ road/NN to/TO athens/NNS and/CC in/IN vouliagmeni/NNS centre/NN there/EX are/VBP several/JJ slightly/RB cheaper/JJR restaurants/NNS ./.

you/PRP will/MD need/VB a/DT car/NN if/IN you/PRP are/VBP staying/VBG for/IN longer/JJR than/IN a/DT day/NN or/CC two/CD to/TO be/VB able/JJ to/TO access/NN restaurants/NNS and/CC shops/NNS outside/IN the/DT hotel/NN ./.

parking/NN at/IN the/DT hotel/NN is/VBZ free/JJ ./.

the/DT westin/NN hotel/NN itself/PRP is/VBZ large/JJ and/CC sprawling/JJ with/IN a/DT nice/JJ and/CC attractive/JJ lobby/NN on/IN the/DT 6th/JJ floor/NN -LRB-/-LRB- top/JJ floor/NN -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC rooms/NNS on/IN floors/NNS 0/CD to/TO 4/CD ,/, all/DT below/IN the/DT lobby/NN level/NN ./.

make/VB sure/JJ you/PRP are/VBP on/IN a/DT high/JJ floor/NN to/TO appreciate/VB the/DT view/NN of/IN the/DT pool/NN and/CC the/DT bay/NN ./.

rooms/NNS have/VBP been/VBN recently/RB renovated/VBN in/IN the/DT style/NN westin/NN have/VBP adopted/VBN globally/RB with/IN pale/JJ colours/NNS and/CC bathrooms/NNS with/IN glass/NN walls/NNS ./.

all/DT rooms/NNS have/VBP balconies/NNS ./.

breakfast/NN is/VBZ served/VBN in/IN the/DT restaurant/NN at/IN pool/NN level/NN -LRB-/-LRB- zero/CD -RRB-/-RRB- and/CC was/VBD well/RB run/VBN with/IN plenty/NN of/IN choice/NN ./.

the/DT outdoor/JJ swimming/NN pool/NN is/VBZ large/JJ with/IN plenty/NN of/IN sun-loungers/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- i/FW counted/VBN 175/CD -RRB-/-RRB- ./.

unfortunately/RB when/WRB we/PRP stayed/VBD at/IN the/DT weekend/NN ,/, the/DT pool/NN got/VBD horrendously/RB busy/JJ to/TO such/PDT an/DT extent/NN that/IN we/PRP could/MD not/RB find/VB a/DT single/JJ free/JJ sun-lounger/NN and/CC were/VBD unable/JJ to/TO use/VB the/DT pool/NN ./.

the/DT hotel/NN was/VBD full/JJ to/TO capacity/NN with/IN two/CD large/JJ conferences/NNS ,/, but/CC we/PRP later/RB found/VBD out/IN that/IN the/DT hotel/NN also/RB sell/VBP day-passes/NNS to/TO non/JJ residents/NNS to/TO come/VB and/CC use/VB the/DT pool/NN facilities/NNS ./.

i/LS think/VB this/DT is/VBZ an/DT appalling/JJ practice/NN for/IN a/DT resort/NN hotel/NN to/TO allow/VB non-residents/NNS to/TO use/VB the/DT pool/NN so/IN that/IN residents/NNS who/WP pay/VBP eur/NN 300/CD a/DT night/NN for/IN a/DT resort/NN hotel/NN with/IN an/DT outdoor/JJ swimming/NN pool/NN can/MD not/RB use/VB it/PRP because/IN wealthy/JJ locals/NNS who/WP have/VBP purchased/VBN day/NN tickets/NNS are/VBP occupying/VBG the/DT sun-loungers/NNS ./.

i/LS can/MD not/RB comment/VB on/IN the/DT quality/NN of/IN the/DT restaurants/NNS because/IN they/PRP were/VBD all/DT shut/VBN ./.

whilst/IN the/DT westin/NN website/NN states/VBZ that/IN two/CD of/IN the/DT restaurants/NNS are/VBP seasonal/JJ and/CC operates/VBZ only/RB from/IN may/MD to/TO september/NNP ,/, i/FW was/VBD surprised/VBN to/TO be/VB told/VBN that/IN on/IN a/DT thursday/NNP night/NN that/IN not/RB a/DT single/JJ restaurant/NN would/MD be/VB open/JJ at/IN the/DT westin/NN and/CC only/RB one/CD would/MD be/VB open/JJ at/IN the/DT nearby/JJ arion/NN resort/NN ./.

fortunately/RB we/PRP had/VBD a/DT car/NN so/IN we/PRP could/MD eat/VB at/IN restaurants/NNS outside/IN the/DT resort/NN ./.

overall/RB ,/, the/DT hotel/NN is/VBZ very/RB nice/JJ with/IN amazing/JJ views/NNS and/CC a/DT good/JJ pool/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT experience/NN was/VBD marred/VBN by/IN the/DT fact/NN that/IN we/PRP could/MD not/RB use/VB the/DT pool/NN on/IN a/DT sunday/NNP because/IN it/PRP was/VBD full/JJ of/IN non-residents/NNS and/CC the/DT -LRB-/-LRB- complete/JJ -RRB-/-RRB- lack/NN of/IN open/JJ restaurants/NNS in/IN may/MD even/RB though/IN the/DT hotel/NN was/VBD full/JJ to/TO capacity/NN ./.
