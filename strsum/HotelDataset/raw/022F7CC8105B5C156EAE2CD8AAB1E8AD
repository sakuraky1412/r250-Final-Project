my initial reaction on arrival was quite good .
rooms were not ready , but we were shown to a board room and given tea and coffee until the rooms were ready .
i had a `` silver '' room but although very dark was quite elegant .
however being next to the store cupboard meant that the door was banging all day long , not great for a rest , and the floorboards are very noisy in the corridors .
others in our party complained of cold showers in rooms , and air con that just came on at random ! !
they main problem was that some of our party went outside to smoke late at night whilst having drinks , ( let out by the night manager ) , but when they tried to return he refused to let them in ? ?
two had key cards , but the third had his ket in his jacket in the bar .
the night manager not only refused to let them in , but said they were not staying at the hotel , and also accused them of lying when they told him they were ! ! !
he even cleared away their drinks whilst they were having the cigarette .
when i asked about this in the morning , i was told that night staff are trained to stop 'non guests ' from getting access at night .
that i understand , but how does that work with not allowing registered guests back in .
not a very good policy , and perhaps some further training is . . .
