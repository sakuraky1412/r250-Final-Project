Pros:. Excellent price / performer makes this a 10. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I deliberated for a year and read everything available. I was going to buy the Samsung LNS3251D but my son (who works in the business)advised me to buy the Vizio. I thought I would be settling for the Yugo car of flat panels. This thing is super. It delivers excellent colors that are vivid. Like others, I bought it at Costco for $ 699. I'm convinced that reviewers like CNET have the best intentions when they write "The bad: Subpar black-level performance; inconsistent grayscale tracking..". Man, I'm sure not seeing it. I have the Vizio connected to a Cox set top box via RGB cables. Watching the Discovery channel is like going to the IMAX. Sold my Sony 27" Wega tube TV on Craigslist for $140 and bought this. One year warranty from Vizio plus Costco friendly return policy makes this a great first step to move into the world of High Def without mortgaging the house.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lowcost, HDMI input, Design,. 
Cons:. Haven't found a single one : ). 
Summary:. I purchased this TVand I am very impressed with its clarity and ease of use. I was looking for an LCD HDTV for my bedroom and after shopping for a week at Best-Buy, Wal-Mart, and Costco. I found that this LCD to be the best bang for the buck. The HD Movies that are out have amazing sound and picture quality. I did hook up a Monster Powercenter and Monster HDMI THX 1000, so it is as clear of a picture that the TV can produce. Look into Monster products, you will be amazed at the difference it makes for a couple hundred bucks (since you are investing some $)on th sound and picture quality. Anywho, this LCD ROCKS!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. inexpensive, vibrant colours, hdtv tuner. 
Cons:. -no analog input for VGA. 
Summary:. I have been looking for a good HDTV for a long time now. I knew I wanted LCD, since I move around alot, and CRT's and DLP's seemed just too big. Plasmas on the other hand I knew were a bit succeptable to burn in, and their brightness did not even seem close to some of the LCD's I was looking at. I walked into costco and I saw this one, it looked pretty darn good. Then I looked at the price, $869? I think "That's it? Well it's probably one of those no-name korean comapies just opening up on the market." Then I look and see on the box the company's from california.. I go back home, do some research, come back a few weeks later look at it again, and think well, heck, this tv isn't half bad. It has all the specs of a $1400 tv, but it's only $870. So I try and compare it with the tv's beside it. Some Philips or something and a sony. I looked back and fourth back and fourth and to tell you the truth I couldn't really tell the difference. The sony looked a bit better, but in my mind it was nowhere near worth spending three times the price of this tv on a difference so small.. So I bring it up and to the counter to find out it's on sale now for $799. I thought "hmmm maybe this tv isn't that good, I mean I only spent 800 without taxes. Usually when it's too good to be true it usually is." I bring it home and the first thing I notice is there is no analog input for the VGA, so that kinda sucks. But I have a optical out anyhow and if I want I have the other set of component cables. I turn on the tv and went to the menu. I was impressed to see a adjustable backlight, something only expensive LCD's have. After tinkering around with the settings. I look at the picture and was blown away. It was so bright, so vibrant. I still couldn't believe this was only 800 bucks. Well I figured that if it was so bright, the blacks are going to suck. So I turn off the lights and boot up a movie. I pause it in the begining where the screen is all black. I looked at it for a while and to tell you the truth, I have no idea what the reviews were talking about, since the blacks on this tv where pretty darn black. They weren't dark grey, they didn't have any tinge to them, they were dark black.. I then boot up a xbox 360 game to see how well it looks. Well it worked prefectly. No blurring whatsoever, no ghosting. Everything was perfectly crisp and clear. Looked stunning in VGA on the 1280 x 720 setting.. I tried looking but I can't find many faults with this tv. I mean even if it does break down, I got it at costco, so I can return it anytime I want, no questions asked.. I think people with $2600 tv's are just quick to condone less expensive tv's as a way to justify thier purchase of such an expensive television.. All in all I was very impressed with this tv. The number of features, the hieght of quality and the value all justify a 10 out of 10 in my books.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good quality, even through non HDTV, goes up to 1080i, extremely cheap. 
Cons:. Only one HDMI port. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture and audio.. 
Cons:. No mini stereo headset jack.. 
Summary:. I'd rate it 8.5, but that was not an option. I am very pleased with this purchase! I bought it for a BR TV. I connected my DirecTV HDMI cable and turned it on. It took me longer to program my DirecTV remote that it did to unbox it and set it up.. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a bargain. You can get a better picture, but you have to pay a LOT more to get it.. Excellent HD picture and sound. Non-HD is very good as well.. JimC. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and ease of use straight out of the box.. 
Cons:. None that I have noticed.. 
Summary:. Excelent first time purchase of an LCD TV. Buy it!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Computer hookup and light weight.. 
Cons:. Inputs on the side rather than all in the back.. 
Summary:. I did some research for about six months before buying this model. I move a lot and found out that some movers will not insure Plasmas. That was a selling point for me to look at LCDs. My Vizio is great and the picture needed just a little adjusting after hooking it up to my computer. The instructions are easy to read and the controls are easy to use too.. Any other TV in it's class will cost you about $200 more and the quality will be about the same. From what I've read, there are only a few companies that make components for the HDTVs and the only real difference is the brand name.. It's been three months now since I bought mine at COSTCO and it's going strong. You need to have a digital feed to get the quality viewing the TV was made for. If you don't, you might as well use a CRT. Speaking of CRT, my 32" CRT weighs a lot and that's a big deal to me when one lives in a two story home!. I love my Vizio!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, good colors, lightweight, good speakers. 
Cons:. Not as bright as others. 
Summary:. I am really happy with this purchase. I paid $400 less than comparable TVs. Vizio has a good picture. I recommend this TV if you are not looking for the state of the art performance. The price is right!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fully loaded, crisp clean PQ. 
Cons:. Its not a Samsung or Pioneer. 
Summary:. Extremly good LCD, especially for the money. It cost less than half the price of a major brand of the same size, but it definetely does not look like it cost half as much. What you get for what you pay, I beleive the Vizio brand is the absolute best deal in HDTV right now.. Low price, high quality!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp picture, awesome surround sound, great tuner. 
Cons:. Remote control is so-so, sharp-angle view is not as good as some others. 
Summary:. I needed a new TV for my bedroom, as my 20-year-old 26-inch RCA was making weird buzzing noises. Just happened to be the weekend of the Super Bowl, and my girlfriend doesn't have HDTV. To kill 2 birds with a single stone, I went down to Costco on the strength of these user reviews, anf LOVED the picture on the demo set. Seriously, the picture on this 32-inch set was WAY sharper than the picture on the set next to it, and that was a 27-inch LCD. That's not supposed to happen, as smaller sets always have sharper pictures. I was sold; it was Friday night, so I put the box in my truck and drove over to my girlfriend's house. It took about 5 minutes to unpack it, set it on a wooden box in her living room, attach the OTA antenna, and turn it on. The on-screen menu asked me the Language, and then offered to Scan for OTA channels. It picked up 12 Analog and 18 Digital here in Sacramento, and the digital channels came in crystal clear. My gf was amazed, she thought I would have to disconnect her DirectTV box in order to get reception on the new set. Not necessary, we watched the Super Bowl on Sunday in absolutely perfect HD.. Now, about the surround sound. To say I was surprised is an understatement. I was actually Blown Away! I have a complete Home Theater at my house, but this little TV with funky speakers that form a dimple in the middle was as good as my home system. I watched the FBR Open golf tournament on NBC and couldn't get over how good it sounded. The commentary came directly from the center, but the crowd noise and natural sounds seemed to come from all around me. There was a bird chirping in Scottsdale but I thought it was in the room, off to the right. When I pressed MUTE, the bird was silenced. Wow, is that great sound, or what? When the SB started, it was more of the same: Jim Nantz and Phil Simms from the center, and the cheering crowd from all around me. I don't know how they do it, but it is pretty damn good sound for a $699 TV.. When I brought the TV home after the game and set it up in my bedroom, I placed it on the floor until I could get someone to help me lift the old TV off the stand. From a standing up position looking down, the picture is pretty washed out, so the angle viewing is not the best on this set. I would think that if you have a large room where you might be in the next room watching the set, you should probably buy a plasma for the best angle viewing. But for a bedroom where you'll pretty much be watching from a straight-on angle, this TV is excellent.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright display, full-featured selection of inputs, good sound. 
Cons:. POP limited, few canned picture set-up options, defaults to mono sound.. 
Summary:. As the owner of a Dell 3201, a Toshiba 50" projection and now the Vizio L32, I think I'm qualified to say this is a great set -- at least in the bedroom where it's replacing an old 27" TV.... I found it easy to set up, including the remote control. Unfortunately, it won't control my ASTAR DVD-3100 player, but that's a minor concern. I should upgrade that any way.. The picture is clear, and the HD mode is about 90% of the detail of my Dell 3201. For a $600 - $700 difference, that's no big deal.... Some quirkiness in the way the TV receives my coax-input cable shows -- they seem to be coming in mono, and even after I manually reset them to stereo, they go back to mono.. The DVD picture is crisp using component outputs.. All in all, this is a very good -- some might say excellent -- bedroom set. I'm thinking about buying another.... 

$$;
Pros:. Cost, # of outputs, picture clarity, concise manual.. 
Cons:. Some color run on low-def.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for a high-value LCD TV set for a low price this is your set.. The picture out of the box is great - vivid 3 seems to work best for us. With no fiddling or calibration you get a great HD picture. It's not up to par with the best plasmas or the higher-end LCD's but if you want to spend an additional thousand or more dollars for a marginally better picture and more screen area, that's up to you.. Installation was a breeze thanks to the concise and instructive manual. Be sure to read up on the CNET accessories guide though and make sure you get your component or HDMI cables so you save yourself another trip.. There are tons of outputs - HDMI, component, s-video, optical - you name it, it's there. Plenty of room for all your toys and gadgets.. The only complaint is that on certain non-HD cable channels we experience some color-run with faces depending on the lighting - red teeth, etc.. Bottom line: If you're a normal joe who wants a good HD picture for his hard-earned money, this is the set for you. Hardcore videophiles with unlimited budgets should look elsewhere.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price. Price. Price. Nice set of connectiion options. Did I mention price?. 
Cons:. Color balancing a bit off. Box didn't quite fit in my car..... 
Summary:. I went to Costco to buy a $1.50 chicken-bake, walked out with this $799.99 puppy instead. Worth every penny so far. The only real problem I have with the set is that the color balancing is kinda off but it isn't too much of an inconvenience. It doesn't show up that much in a HD source (my test for it was the HD cables for the Xbox 360). If you don't have HD cable or satellite, do yourself a favor if you get one of these TVs, get one of the 2. Regular cable sucks on this set. Then again most people who get a set this size usually have one or the other anyway, so don't let that discourage you.. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture, sounds great. 
Cons:. not much difference between warm, cool, and vivid options. 
Summary:. I did aqbout 3 weeks of research before I bought this tv. I bought it from Sam's Club for $699.. I use this TV for gaming on the Xbox 360 and to watch football games on. The picture is clear and the color is great.. I am very pleased with the sounds of the tv. The sound of a rifle shot on the Xbox 360 sounds better than when I had the 360 hooked up through a stereo. It really adds to the games I am playing.. Live tv looks great in both regular def, but this TV really shines at HD mode. It is like looking through a window, the way HD is supposed to be.. The TV looks best in vivid mode, and the cool and warm modes are not that much different.. It does have a HDMI input and (if I remember right) 2 compononent connections.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDMI hook up is seemless. Colors are great and Crisp. DVD picture is awesome.. 
Cons:. 1 S-video connection on the side, but not really an issue.. 
Summary:. After reading some reviews and then checking it out at Costco, I had to get this tv. Costco even had a $100 dollars off macking this a $700 dollar steal.. I got home and was amazed on the quality of the packaging. If you ever purchase a server this is exactly how they are packaged. I first tried over the air HD, and I got a good picture, not great, but good. I then hooked up the cable, (digital) and had the tv scan for sources. At first i was disappointed, but realized I connected the cable not via my Digital Cable Box, but directly into the TV/CABLE RCA so the TV did not recognize a DTR signal. I change the set up and again very good picture.. My favorite out of the box display was the Vivid 3 setting with the picture set to panormaic.. Now on to HD content. I then connected it via HDMI to my HDTV Converter Box and all I CAN SAY was WOW!!! The performance and image was better then the plasmas at the local Fox Sports Bar. The colors where true(no articfial red, green or blue), crisp on HD and non-HD signals. The only issue was I dont have all my channels in HD. The HD channels consume the entire screen and are surrounded by a gray bar or graphic when commercials or non-HD content is broadcast if you are worried about burn in. The same for non-HD channels. I spent 4 hours just watching ESPNHD and DISCOVER HD. If the 50 inch version is as good as this one, I got a perm replacement for my entertainment room.. DVD image was amazing via S-video, which thankfully my cord was long enough to reach the side, but like I said this became a non issue very quickly. I then set up this tv with a home theater system using an HDMI switcher to control switching of HDMI sources between the cable converter and dvd. My DVD does up-convert the signal so that the tv does not have to.. By this TV you will be amazed and I have yet to run it through a home theater DVD setup to fine tune it.. 

$$;
Pros:. 10 on Price. 
Cons:. 8.8 on Picture. 
Summary:. $799.00 with built in tuner! Cant find better for the price. Used in bedroom with a Sony HD 3000 box with DVI to HDMI. Picture is much clearer then in store (CostCo). Grant it it's not as clear as the Sony but its not $1400.00+ either. I will purchase a second one for my daughters room. Two 32 LCD for under $1600.00 how can you justify spending more.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy install. 
Cons:. sound quality. 
Summary:. As a woman on a budget, watching a 20" Apex I wanted a new HDTV that I could afford on my small budget. I bought the LG 30" CRT for $759 @ Best Buy but had a very bad experience with 2 bad sets (would not power on) and BB customer service. Based on the Cnet review of this set I took a trip to my local Sams and saw the set priced at $799. Sam's was playing sub-par dvd that did not look as good as the more expensive name brand sets but I thought "you get what you can pay for". Since this TV was my budget I decided to settle for 2nd best.. I got the set home, carried it in all by myself, and installed the cable from my digital cable box. I have to admit that I was prepared for a TV that would only be mediocre. I found that I was plesantly surprised. The picture is great. The only drawback I see so far is the quality of the sound; hopefully I will be able to adjust once I have the opportunity to read the manual.. All in all I am pleased. In view of some other consumer reviews I did buy the 3 year service plan for $79 but thought it was a good price since BB and CC are almost $250. 32" LCD HDTV, including the service plan, for less that $900......fantastic.. 

$$;
Pros:. Definitly affordable, great picture, nice design. I'm 100% pleased.. 
Cons:. I can't really think of any, other than my snooty friends will wonder why I didn't get a Sony, just because of the brand name.. 
Summary:. Hey, I think that this is a quality piece of equipment. Vizio brings us a clean design, good sound, great picture ... and it's at Sam's Club for only 800$.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding picture quality, excellent instruction manual actually written in English instead of Geekspeak.. 
Cons:. Only S-VHS input is on the side instead of the rear; cable mars otherwise clean, simple design. Halfass remote will turn DVD on/off but not control the player.. 
Summary:. I was nervous about buying an unknown brand, especially when I read on the box "Made in China," but now feel I got an amazing bargain: $700 at Costco. Similar name brand sets cost more than double that. I watch the screen, not the logo.. Other than a couple of relatively minor design flaws noted in Pros and Cons I'm totally satisfied with the set. Watching movies with the audio feeding into my Bose is awesome!. BTW, CNET needs to update its "Where to buy" section, which told me this set is not available in any store in my area of Washington State; my Costco has stocked them for months.. 

$$;
Pros:. Builtin Digital/HDTV, as well as Analog. 
Cons:. Warranty could be longer. 
Summary:. I'm absolutely not a video professional. I'm just your typical guy who wanted a digital television that didn't take a lot of room.. I had come to the conclusion that we weren't going to purchase another television that didn't have a QAM tuner builtin since we're SUPPOSED to be all digital sometime in the near future.. This thing has it, with a myriad of inputs/outputs. I'm very satisfied for the price. I didn't see any other televisiions for the price that had everything this Vizio model has.. Make sure you get the 10A model, otherwise it may not have the QAM tuner builtin.. I'm happy and I'd buy another one.... Charles Whealton. Chuck Whealton @ pleasedontspam.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good picture and sound in a reasonably price set.. 
Cons:. I haven't found any yet.. 
Summary:. When I first saw this set at Costco, I thought that it had a great price and the picture looked as good or better than the bigger name sets near it. When I got it home, it was easy to unpack and hook up. I got an hdvi cable at Walmart and the set works perfectly for much less than anything comparable that I found out there. Additionally, I have the comfort of purchasing it from Costco, so I know that if there is a problem, I can take it back there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Relatively inexpensive. 
Cons:. ATSC tuner does not handle weak signals well; DTV tuner handles channels only up to 125. 
Summary:. I own two Panasonic 37" plasmas; an ED monitor and an HDTV. Both have excellent picture quality (I use an HD cable box with the monitor and a Cable Card with the TV), but cost over $2,000 (the monitor is more than 2-1/2 years old). I needed a flat-panel television for a guest bedroom and wanted to keep the cost down, so I just purchased an L32HDTV from Sam's Club for only $869.88.. Although the L32HDTV's picture quality is not as good as that of my Panasonic plasmas, its picture quality is more than acceptable for the price. It is an incredible value, particularly because it includes digital (DTV) and HDTV tuners. I had previously purchased a 32" ILO (Initial) LCD HDTV from Wal-Mart, but it had only an analog tuner and its picture quality was not acceptable, even for $2.88 less than the L32HDTV. Because I use it in a guest bedroom, I did not want to pay for an additional cable box or Cable Card; it displays only what it can tune in from my Comcast cable line. What it tunes in are all of the analog channels and some of the DTV channels. I do not get over-the-air HDTV signals in my area.. The only quibbles I have with the L32HDTV are that the analog tuner does not handle weak signals well and the DTV tuner only handles channels up to 125 (unfortunately, Comcast's HD channels are all over 125). I have an old CRT television that, unlike the L32HDTV, handles the weak analog signals from my cable line without any distortion at all. However, my cable line goes through an eight-line splitter to five televisions and a cable/VOIP modem, so I had already planned to purchase a cable signal amplifier to eliminate occasional HDTV pixellation and improve cable modem connectivity. It would also be more convenient if the coax inputs for the analog and DTV tuners were not separate.. The L32HDTV's positive attributes also include high-end packaging, terrific documentation and a table stand, although I have already taken advantage of an included 10% off accessories offer and ordered an articulating wall mount directly from Vizio for $80.99 ($32.49 for the cheapest FedEx shipping option is steep, but the total price is still reasonable). The remote is not backlit, but can handle up to three additional components and has button access to the functions I commonly use, including changing inputs (e.g., from analog to DTV) and changing picture aspect (e.g., from normal to wide).. Bottom Line: The L32HDTV is the best flat-panel HDTV value on the market today.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amount of inputs, picture quality, sound, packing, built-in tuners and universal remote.. 
Cons:. I wish it had a Monitor Out for recording to DVD or VCR. 
Summary:. OK. I have to put my two cents in on this subject.. I love this TV!. I have only delt with a Panasonic 42" Plasma and a RCA 32" LCD. All I know is that this TV has a very good picture and sound. This set kills the RCA hands down!!!! I also like the picture better on the LCD than on the plasma because the the picture is so much brighter. I think it has much better sound than the RCA and par with the Panasonic. It has PIP and POP. I love the POP and think I'll be using that most of the time. with PIP I hate that one corner is always covered up at all times. With POP you have two smaller pictures side by side whitch is what I like better. Now too the remote! It is rock solid. I was going to purchase the Logitech Universal Learning Remote for around $120 dollars so I could get all of the menus and other buttons to work unlike other remotes that just give you basic features. The univerasal remote worked on my Cable Bos/DVR, DVD Player and VCR and I got everything to work. NO JOKE! The speed button for the VCR work, all of the setup menus for my equipment worked and all of the extra features for the DVR worked. WOW. Yesterday I put all of my remotes back in my dressser to free up some space and now I don't have to pay so much for all of the batteries used. This is the best part. It was on sale at Walmart for $896 I think? All for under $1000 dollars. I don't think there is any deal out there better than this. I think for anyone this would be a very good HDTV for any where in the house. Hope you like it as much as I do.. 

$$;
Pros:. adequate inputs for this size tv. 
Cons:. audio 3 inputs on side. 
Summary:. purchased this set at costco last week 3-31-06.. the set-up instructions were easy to read and follow.. i am using a comcast cable box with dvi output to the tv that has a hdmi input.. i have the picture but no sound. input mode on the tv is set to 'HDTV'. i can't find any red or white jacks on the cable box that say output audio unless you use the red and white jacks that are associated this the component. i tried those jacks but still no sound.. in addition i have hooked up a sony dvd/vcr. combo with component hookup to to the tv labeled 'analog hd1'. nothing happened,but i hooked up the vcr to 'av1'. now i can watch vhs tapes and dvd through 'av1'. the picture on the dvd's is good but not spectular as i would like. if anybody out there is having this problem and has a soultion please write another review.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture and sound quality. 
Cons:. Only one S-video Jack and it is on the side (looks bad). 
Summary:. Bought the L32 This Christmas and mounted it on the wall. It realy looks great and far exceded my expectations.. 

$$;
Pros:. slek look, grat pric good picture. 
Cons:. only 720p some fuzzy channels but could be direct tv. 
Summary:. I helped my mother choose a new flat screen for her new house and we chose the vizeo not only because of the great price (go to Costco!), but the picture quality is great too. Very Happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture. 
Cons:. Could use a few more av and component ports. 
Summary:. This a good HDTV for those of you on a budget. Has a very nice picture quality but you can't connect multiple peripherals at once.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video Games, and HDMI Video. 
Cons:. Sub-par blakc level, sometimes a little greenish in the black areas. 
Summary:. Overall I have been satisfied with the TVs performance. PS2 and PS3 Games look amazing. The only downfall that I have found in this TV has been the already stated, sub-par black levels. When Watching Movies with alot of dark shadows and night scenes, the picture is okay at best.. I would reccomend this TV to anyone looking for an HDTV in this price range.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature Rich. 
Cons:. Minor Macro Blocking. 
Summary:. This is a fantastic value at Sam's Club everyday at $699, despite the fact that CNET says it is not available near me. Make sure you are taking advantage of true HD buy using the HDMI port. It has two. I use a DVI to HDMI cable from my SA 3250 HD and run the sound through a 5.1 system. Awesome. David, why would you want to use a S-Video with this anyways? As said, you can notice some macro blocking, but this it is negligible. Make sure you have this unit not plugged into a powerstrip, but directly into wall, or a single unit surge suppressor. I did get a cycling event situation (unit shut off and restarted), but worked with customer service and this suggestion has solved the issue for months now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, great sound ... affordable. 
Cons:. no backlight on remote. 
Summary:. I bought the 32" a week ago at Costco, and I'm a happy camper! My roommate's b/f had bought her one for her b'day last month. I saw it and liked it. Now we each have one in our bedrooms. We were thinking about putting a 42" plasma in the living room but now we're rethinking the 50" Vizio, at less than half the cost of the plasma. We upgraded our Dish service to HD, but even with analog, the picture was great, now it's awesome. For the price, we couldn't ask for better TV. I've got mine connected to a surround sound system, but even without it, the audio is pretty good. My roomie's son plays his X-Box on her set, and the gaming is great. All-in-all, this is a nice TV, and hopefully I won't have to find out how good (or bad) customer service is.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Picture, Backlight Feature, HDMI Interface, Channel Guide, HDTV Tuner. 
Cons:. No Signal strength Indicator, Remote Coverage Sensitive. 
Summary:. Excellent features makes it the best value for money. Got it from Costco. Connected the Antenna and now watching about 30 Digital Channels, all crisp and clear.. HDMI Interface and Backlight features were the ones I was looking for.. Channel Guide a plus.. A few Cons... Remote has to be pointed specifically at the sensor. No indicator of signal strength.. Audio - OK compared to my old Panasonic CRT. Could be better. But I'm not using the TV audio, so doesn't make a difference.. Overall a great TV with excellent features for a decent price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice picture, standard and HDTV tuners, good price. 
Cons:. not as established as bigger name vendors?. 
Summary:. I like this set. I think some of the complaints that the CNET reviewers list are quite minor. All-in-all I think this is a very good set for the price.. I don't have cable or satellite service; I rely on broadcast signals to get my HDTV. I live near Chicago; I installed a high-quality roof-top antenna and am extremely pleased about the reception and the picture I receive. I tend to agree with the reviewer about how the set may perform better at 720p than at 1080i, but the picture at 1080i is still fine, if not fantastic. Also, the remote is rather difficult to use because of the button size and layout, but nothing that you can't get used to.. I have had the set for about a month and a half and couldn't be happier. I'll never go back to SDTV again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Top notch manual and packageing. 
Cons:. HDtuner may show some false contouring in some scenes. 
Summary:. Being a videophile and all I'll give ya the quick heads up.. First thing you should know about this tv. They have a zero bright pixel garrantee. How well their customer service is I'm not sure but that is a better garrantee than any other tv manufactuare has for LCD tv's anyware that I'm aware of. They also have a 1 year onsite tech support if something should go wrong. And one other nice thing is that they are based out of california, I'm not sure where these tv's are made but know that the company headquarters being american based was reassurring to me since I live in the U.S.. Ok on to some things most people don't care about but I found quite impressive. The box the tv came in was amazingly designed in that you unclip 4 plastic clips and the whole top came off with no cutting tape of any kind. This tv had the best instructions and the best packaging I've ever seen. Everything in the manual was easy to understand and the quick guide to the setup was top notch. Any grandmother could set this sucker up in a heart beat. Which is saying alot for the presentation of the packaging.. On to the remote and first impressions. The remote is a universal that you can program it for 4 devices and it's very well laid out and comfortable in the hand. Upon firing up the tv I first tuned in my basic cable channels and then the hd over the air channels. It didn't take very long at all and went very smoothly. The hd tuner picked up all the channels that my media center pc does and the only one I have troubles with is cbs for some reason in chicago they broadcast on vhf and not uhf like all the others. I always have trouble with cbs. I first turned on the hd but nothing in good hd was playing but I did notice that the channel changes were very fast and the tv had a very nice guide description for the hd channels that could be toggled on and off much like using tivo and displaying what is on at the top and being able the minimize it to just show the channel or all the info for what was playing and so on. Next I went on to trying basic cable. It looks ok, merely ok but some channels are much better than others. Like I said I use basic cable and it's not very good. On the bad channels you would kind of get a slight blurring effect but on the good ones that was almost non existent. Later that night I checked out some of the hd shows and noticed that the hd tuner does a adequate job but the picture never quite looks as sharp as the newer bravias or sammys but it does look good overall, just not great.. Onto the 360. I read somewhere that this tv's picture is much crisper on the hdmi than the components and that the difference was more than you would normally notice. After hooking the 360 via components I noticed that the tv didn't have the same clarity as my dell w2600. It was very good and almost as good but you could tell that the dell was better. So next I hooked up the vga adpater, I tried the 1360*768 resolution since the tv is native 1366*768 but for some reason it made picture off center and could not be fixed. I then switched to the 1280x720 res and was really impressed straight away. I made some minor adjustments and then ran the gammut at it. First of I played all my downloaded hd trailers and was blown away. Over the vga it actually now looked better than my w2600. All the videos just popped off the screen. I then played the beginning of Kameo just to check out the colors. It looked fabulous, again I was floored. I then fired up my media center pc and played some of my hd tv shows. Like prison break and house. It's funny because my recorded shows over the MCE actually looked a tiny bit better than what was currently on the hd tuner. After a bunch of playing with MCE, which worked perfectly at the 1280x720 resolution( my prior westinghouse had issues with MCE and the vga adapter) I tried a dvd. That didn't work out so well. For some oddball reason the DVD was not filling up the whole screen. I then tried it with the components and it worked fine but still wouldn't with the vga adapter. I do have another dvd player hooked to the tv so this didn't bother me much.. To sum it up this tv cost me $999, has a great warranty, good hd, ok analog though I was using cable so it might be better with something else. But the most important it has a 8ms response time and plays xbox360 games with no blurring whatsoever and looks incredible doing it. My decision to buy this tv came down to a few things. Could I return it?, Would it play xbox 360 games well?, and would the hd tuner be any good. Well I'm not gonna return it and it plays xbox 360 games superbly using the vga at 1280x720 and the hd tuner is good but merely acceptable to me. It does it's job but will never stun you like the bravias and sammys. My MCE hdtuner actually does a better job.. In the end I'm happy and this is a tv manufacture worth looking out for in the future. With their superb quality I'm sure we'll be seeing more of them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good specs at an agreeable pricepoint.. 
Cons:. None after purchasing two of these.. 
Summary:. Very hesitant about purchasing a product from a relatively unknown off-brand company. Come to find out Vizio is US based, subcontracting to Thailand manufacturers. Further research shows that specs are above the norm for this price point.. In the end, I made the decision as to whether the incremental specs / features were worth the price difference. They weren't. No regrets either.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen size, HDMI inputs. 
Cons:. no earphone jack. 
Summary:. I've had a 32 inch Vizio for about 6 months and I'm very pleased with the picture and features. I have recorded 900 DVD's and they are all very good quality from this TV. There was little tweaking needed for color rendition and the built in speakers are more than adequate. I paid $599 at Costco with a double manufacturer warranty and concierge support.. 

$$;
Pros:. Under $700, good picture and sound, easy to set-up. 
Cons:. On-screen display is in the way of the screen when making adjustments. 
Summary:. My wife and i have been very happy with this tv. We got it home from Sam's Club and i set it up with no problem. There were better tv's on the market, but they were either more than we wanted to spend or the tv's dimensions didn't work with where the set was going in our small tv room. My only complaint is that the on-screen display dominates the screen which interfers with making adjustments.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, vivid colors, price, hook-ups. 
Cons:. The speakers aren't the best. 
Summary:. I just picked mine up 2 days ago from Wal-Mart, and am quite happy with it so far. It was sticker priced at $884, which came to $939 with michigan 6% sales tax. I was a little worried because I've been reading mixed reviews about the set. But I asked Wal-Mart and they said if I wasn't happy with it, I could return it as long as I had the original box and receipt.. I've heard some people complaining about the "black" not being black. Mine does pitch black just fine. My colors are bright and beautiful. My main uses for it are my PC and my XBOX-360. I run both into the VGA port on the back and the results are just beautiful. This is the first LCD system I've owned, so I really have nothing to compare it to. But like I said, I'm quite happy with it so far.. I'm really not going to use it for much TV, because I only get over the air broadcasting. I cancelled the cable a while ago to save a few bucks. I'm sure with a digital cable box it would look tons better, but the over the air viewing isn't anything to brag about. Perhaps if I had one of those newer antennas for it it would be better. If I pick one up, I'll edit my review and let you know how much improvement I get from it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent at displaying HD signal. 
Cons:. Standard 4:3 TV signals are noticably worse than my old CRT TV.. 
Summary:. I can net out the review of this unit pretty easily. Great displaying HD, OK from DVD and poor from standard definition TV signal. But good enough value to consider.. I bought this for the World Cup. The games looked magnificent via Direct TV (with Tivo). This is sooooo much better than my old standard def set up (with an excellent Sony 27" CRT). All 6 of the HD channels look great and with the addition of a UHF antenna the HD local channels I can receive look fab. But I can't get all of them and futzing with UHF antenna issues is timeconsuming. http://www.antennaweb.org though is the fount of all sorts of good info. And somewhere along the line I was told that if you squawk enough, Direct TV will give you HD broadcast stations (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC), though not necessarily local to you.. Playing DVDs is somewhat problematic. Of course there isn't enough digital info on a standard DVD to take advantage of the display capabilities of HD, so the picture will never match that of a HD source. The TV has 3 modes, normal, wide, and zoom and as long as you are not watching films that have subtitles, zoom is great. You lose a bit of info around the edges for standard 4:3 DVDs but not noticable. If you watch sub-titled films, you have to use 'normal' which makes for a fairly tiny picture on a 32" screen. Very sharp image though.. The problem with DVDs is that the color mapping never seems to be right. One can spend hours messing with the controls trying to get the color right but after the novelty of that wears off, I just tend to accept the picture. It's sharp enough, but the colors often don't seem right. And what works for one DVD doesn't work for another. In contrast, for broadcast HD, no complaints.. The unit really falls down on standard television signals. I marveled at how good my Sony CRT could display old boring NTSC video and compared to that the Vizio seems generations behind. Just to put it in perspective the differences between one HD LCD TV and another brand are, to my eye, pretty subtle. The differences between an average standard def signal on the Vizio (or any other brand LCD) compared to a good (and cheaper) CRT are huge.. My buying process went something like this. First I got all excited about Sony HD CRTs. Great prices (a 32 inch (I think) was running around $500. The rub was that it weighed 170lb. It was huge. My wife balked. All I could think was 'how am I going to get rid of this when I get my next TV'.. So then I looked at the LCDs and the Vizio for $850 seemed great. I bought the Vizio at CostCo (they have an excellent return policy) figuring I would keep looking for the perfect TV. I got very interested in a Sharp 32" LCD and a Samsung. But they were in the $1200-$1500 and they didn't look any better on HD nor for standard def TV signals. I was told if I really wanted the best of both worlds I should look at plasma so I briefly got excited about a Samsung Plasma system. But again, at 2X the cost and honestly, standard def still didn't look as good as on my old Sony CRT.. So the bottomline for me is that these technologies are still rapidly improving and it's crazy to invest relatively large sums in something that will probably be available at half the cost 2 years from now (with a big jump in quality). From that perspective the entry level Vizio is an excellent compromise. I get the great HD experience and well, I just tolerate standard definition limitations.. Be warned- after looking at HD on 32" you are going to wish you had 37" for 42". It just looks so good.. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture. 
Cons:. quality is questionable. 
Summary:. i bought it at costco after new year. use it with charter cable(regular). it worked great. since that was my first LCD set. loved the picture! thought i had a great buy. 10 days later, i couldn't see pictures when i turned on. i had turned it off and on to receive picture. i email Vezio. they sent a replacement within few days.great experience! after viewing two times,the picture started to flash rapidly. ouch!!! i returned it at once. according to the service rep, it happens 1 to 2 times out of 100. i guess it is my luck.. maybe i have to spend few more bucks to get samsung or sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price.... 
Cons:. ...You get what you pay for.... 
Summary:. Decided to jump in and finally buy an LCD flat panel TV. Bought the Vizio L32 in July 2006 from Costco because it looked like a good TV to start with and it had "good" ratings from CNet and others. Well, after 18 months, the picture blacked out for the first time yesterday. Only sound was available. I tried to troubleshoot it by disconnecting it from my DVR cable box and plugging the cable directly into the TV. The picture reappeared but then after 5-7 minutes, the picture blacked out again! Now I have to get with Vizio and see what they can do. Although the set is out-of-warranty, it was a good thing I used my Costco American Express card. I'm covered with their "Buyer's Assurance" plan and will get an additional year of warranty coverage. I still will need to take it to a repair shop for service. If this should happen to you and your Vizio, make sure to see if you're covered with a buyer's protection plan if you paid for your Vizio with your major credit card.. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap and afordable but does not last long. 
Cons:. It lasted 1 hour. 
Summary:. I bought it in a Sam's Club. It lasted one hour. I turned it on and it got frozen. I could not change inputs nor turn it off. I went back to Sam's and exchange it. The second one lasted for one hour. After I turn it on, it turns off on its own after three seconds. It can not stay on anymore. Tomorow, I am going to return and take a refund!. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear, bright image, excellent HD picture, SD is appears neon. 
Cons:. Low quality components; breaks easily; poor warranty support. 
Summary:. Had the thing nine months; broke without any apparent cause. Got what we paid for: cheap TV. Good image quality while it lasted, but risky buying non-established brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent picture. Okay sound quality. 
Cons:. fried and smoked after 2.5 years of minimal use. 
Summary:. I'm disappointed that after only 2.5 years of use, this TV bit the dust. A loud buzz followed by smoke billowing out the backside.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheapest for size. 
Cons:. Like everything else, you get what you pay for!. 
Summary:. The television was adequate for the price, though the picture was never better than mediocre. 2 weeks after warrante expired, picture got bad. 6 more weeks, TV died.. Would have been MUCH better off to pay more money and get a better television!. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture. 
Cons:. You're on your own after 1 yr warranty expires. 
Summary:. Purchased Vizio 32 TV on August 6, 2006 - it died on August 10, 2007. I called the Vizio support desk ( held for 45 minutes) - their answer was "its past the one year warranty - too bad". I did not know Vizio then, but thought it was safe purchase at Sams Club - wish that I had bought another brand. If you buy this unit - get the extended warranty - otherwise you are screwed -. 

$$;
Pros:. there are none in my opinion. 
Cons:. the color , contrast and crispness of LCD bad. 
Summary:. In my opinion pay a little more and get a high quality TV I bought the Vizio at Costco and took it back the same day. and Bought a Phillips 32" lcd the quality of the phillips unit is outstanding.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap (price).. 
Cons:. Cheap (product). 
Summary:. (This product does not deserve even 1 star! However, a star is required in order to send it.) I bought a refurbished Vizio 32" LCD TV. used it for a year and a green hue started to appear on screen. The screen started to gradually lose its brightness. At first I thought I just had bad luck in buying a lemon of a refurbished product. Not until I searched the net did I realize the problem with my TV is not unique. There are scores of Vizio TV owners having the same problem. Well, the other day, a loud "pop" came out of the TV set and the picture started to grow dimmer and dimmer until it completely went dark - and it shut itself off! I turned it back on and I could faintly detect some image on the screen. When I pressed "Menu" to try to adjust the set, the TV turns itself off. This went on repeatedly for at least a half hour before I finally gave up. I went out and bought an RCA 32" LCD TV at Walmart and so far have been happy with it. No more Vizio for me! My advice to anyone out there in the market for a TV is: DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY!. 

$$;
Pros:. Would not buy again-garbage. 
Cons:. Poor picture makes people look stretched, sound not very good, connections on back upside down you have to lay on your back to connect. Worst service in the industry, they replaced our tv 3 times, refused us a new one, don't buy.. 
Summary:. Exterior shell looks nice, but nothing good on the inside.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought my 32 inch L32 TV in May 2005. It had numerous features and inputs, and pretty much all that one would want in a 21st century TV at a reasonable price of a $1000.. 
Cons:. The power board lasted less than 2 years, and that was pretty much the lifetime of the TV.. 
Summary:. After two years of use, the TV had no picture and only sound. After numerous phone-calls with the VIZIO tech support, I found out that the TVs power board had gone bad. After researching on the web, I realized that it was a common problem with VIZIO TVs. However, the company refuses to take any responsibility for engineering a bad product and wants to charge me hundreds of dollars for replacing its own faulty power board. Ultimately, I am left with a fancy looking expensive Radio that VIZIO sells as a TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap $799. 
Cons:. lasted 1 year 4 months. 
Summary:. I suppose one should not complain after paying only $799 for 32' hdtv but only a year and few months after casual use meaning 7:00pm to 10:00pm 4 or 5 nights a week this pile just stoped working after speaking with the manufacture well you know what their responce was. I only with they imprited in the floor models were their purchased to expect a little over a year of use, conviniently after their 12 month warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture quality; easy to set up; user-friendly.. 
Cons:. Unpredictable remote control; short-lived product; poor manufacturer support.. 
Summary:. Worst TV-buying experience in my life. Bought it from online retailer--one for myself and one for my parents. I was ecstatic with the picture quality. Then the remote started acting up for both TVs--not responding until the batteries were removed, all the buttons pressed, and batteries replaced. Then the buttons on my parents' console panel stopped responding. I was able to order them a replacement unit because it was w/in 30 days. Then my tuner fried after emitting a loud squeal and the screen went blue. The retailer's warranty is over and I have to deal w/Vizio who is putting me thru the mill because I didn't buy directly from them. Two defective units in one family--it must be genetic. You take a chance if you buy a Vizio.. 

$$;
Pros:. inexpensive for the technology, but then again you get what you pay for.. 
Cons:. After having this LCD tv for not even 3 years, I have black lines running up and down the panel, and tech support said : it would be cheaper to buy a new tv then to get it fixed.. 
Summary:. cheap crap. Spend the extra 200 and get a name brand. I can't afford a new tv, I spent 700 on this one, saying the LCD should last up to 20 years. UP TO 20 years. BS! get a different TV. 

$$;
Pros:. Low Price - But to the old adage, you get what you pay for.. 
Cons:. TV broke w/i 6 months of purchase. They replaced parts 2x, replaced on the 3rd time it broke and now the 4th time BROKE AGAIN, all under 2 yrs; TV has broken 4 times in under 2 yrs. It won't even turn on so can't even watch DVD, play game - NOTHING.. 
Summary:. The 3 technicians that have come out to date, said it was a common problem and that they would never buy one. And to boot, the customer service reps had horrible attitudes when I have spoken to them. DO NOT RECOMMEND.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up, and liked the look of the TV itself.. 
Cons:. I don't like the fact that we can't just take the TV somewhere locally and get it fixed. And that the TV just quits on you for no reason.. 
Summary:. Our Vizeo tv is 1 year old this month ( the date on back says it was made in Nov 2007 ) there is sound but no picture, we have contacted the company in California, in October and were expecting a call back. Our tv was still under warrenty then and now it is not. There was no bad connections at all it worked one day; then it didn't the next. Just wondering what can be done ???? I live in Canada, bought the tv in Calais Maine ( Wal Mart ). 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap &#38; Plentiful. 
Cons:. Cheap-you get even less than you pay for. 
Summary:. 2006 Purchase of Vizio P42HDTV. My previous happy ownership &#38; recommendation of VIZIO has gone down the drain tonight as I look at what is apparently a very expensive paperweight hanging on the wall of my living room.. My Vizio flickered on &#38; off a few times on it's own the last few days, then today it simply would not turn on at all. The amber light is on, but it will not turn on, nothing, zip. We tried power cycling it, by disconnecting the power for 3 min. ect., and still nothing. Then cae the realization that we, like probably millions of other consumers had been had. The joy of finding a Flat, Plasma or LCD television at such a reasonable cost, came with a very heavy price. While the initial purchase was less expensive than other brands, what you don't know when you buy it is that you will be buying another one in 2 years or so instead of 5 or 6 with most brands. My problem is not a lone one, in a hopes of finding a solution online I typed "vizio won't turn on" into Google. The resulting 43,100 web pages confirmed my fears. It is a common &#38; known Vizio problem, and there is no fix, it appears to be terminal. For roughly the cost of a new television, one consumer that had the same problem, he posted on HDGURU.COM in April 08- Vizio offered to send a repair man within 10 days for the low, low price of $895, if the repair man could not fix the problem, they would only charge him $285 to tell him it was broken.. Vizio won't even offer an answer as to what the problem is, if they would tell us it's a bad main board or another component, maybe we would have a chance, but even most television repair shops won't work on a Vizio! As I write this post on Vizio's website discussion board, my husband reminds me that it will likely be deleted before any sees it. He believes this because he reviewed 76 pages of discussions there, and this problem was not mentioned once, not once on Vizio's page, but over 43,100 times on the first search enine employed to find a solution. As I have copied this post and intend to place it on as many consumer websites as I can, I sincerely hope that maybe Vizio, as they review the post, will at least acknowledge the problem in a strait forward and professional manner. We have have been duped into buying "disposable" televisions from them once, but surely they cannot think that in the information age we would do so a second time without an appropriate customer service response to an obviously growing problem..
