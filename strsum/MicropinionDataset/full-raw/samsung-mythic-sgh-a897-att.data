10 years of flip phones this is my first touch phone  .
this is actually fun to setup  .
i recommend this phone to anyone who needs something simple to train on  .
til g4 phone's get simple thanks samsung , again  .
updated  .
on nov 1 , 2010  .
for the price and simplictity of the phone i give it an a plus plus , , , , , the camera and pictures are great also  .
i bought this phone after reading plenty of reviews and doing research  .
so far it's everything i could ask for in a phone  .
i unlocked it to use with t    mobile , and the call quality is great  .
i love the touchscreen , as it is very responsive  .
it requires a little bit of pressure , so it is not as sensitive to the touch as the iphone  .
i find this is a very good feature because it means that you don't press random keys by mistake  .
it is very easy to get used to  .
texting on this phone is a breeze  .
its t9 serves as an auto correct in qwerty mode , so if you're typing fast , it automatically corrects any mistakes  .
so you get barely any typos  .
it is a very smart feature that doesnt get in the way  .
the period , comma , and question marks are available on the abc and numerical screen when texting , so u dont have to go back and forth between abc and symbols  .
the camera takes pretty good pics  .
it's auto focus works pretty well for a phone  .
it also has a blinding flash that you can enable or disable easily , along with many cool picture options such as frames and mosaics , so u can get really creative  .
it also includes a smile shot , and panoramic picture option which is really cool  .
you can even edit pictures right on your phone , so if you like the picture but the brightness or contrast is a little off you can change it right there on the phone  .
you can even warp , rotate , blur , crop , and add cool little frames , clip arts , emoticons , and text  .
this can keep anyone entertained for hours  .
the sound is very loud and clear  .
you can listen to music on it without any distortions  .
you can even have it playing in the background as you text or navigate menus , etc  .
the 3  .
5 mm jack is a great feature so u can listen to your music anywhere  .
the widgets are pretty cool , and very customizable  .
you can even customize your 3 main menus very easily  .
its charger is a micro usb , so u can charge it with a computer as well  .
it has a cool little bar which displays any texts , missed calls , emails , ims , voicemails , and missed events , right on the main screen  .
the screen is beautiful and shows crisp colorful images without a sweat  .
also you can have as many alarms as u like , which is a plus for me (that way you dont have to change them constantly , just add a new one) you can set it to ring at specific days of the week , and also you can snooze it up to 10 times (most people dont do this but if you wanted to you could) and you can set the interval between each snooze  .
i recently added internet to my t    mobile plan , so i cant use it until next month , so i cant really comment on its internet performance another feature i really like is that anytime you press something on the screen , it gives a little vibrate , which is really cool , because it kind of feels like you're pressing an actual button (you can turn this feature off if you don't like it though , which is cool too if you dont want that)  .
the one thing i do not like about this phone is that when you send or receive a text message , it automatically saves them to your sim card , which means it can get full fairly fast and you woud have to move them or delete them after a while  .
(you can still receive texts even if the im is full , because then it saves to your phone , but a little dialogue box comes up every few minutes) it's not a big deal really , and i still love the phone , i just wish i would have read about this beforehand all in all i am very happy for my purchase and adore my new phone  .
good luck , and i hope this helps .
if data plans r just too expensive for u , this is the best possible phone u can get  .
i use this phone a lot for music everyday and i also watch a lot of videos and it is great for a media/entertainment person  .
even the internet surfing speed is good  .
the camera has a very bright flash and overall , this is probably the best feature phone .
i just picked up my samsung mythic last week and i am quite eager to learn a thing or two last phone that i modded is the razr and that has bee quite some time ago  .
i'm enjoying the samsung mythic thus far and will probably start making wallpapers and ringtones in the near future  .
you can check out my wallpapers at http  //www  .
samsung    mythic  .
com take care .
great phone at great price  .
great phone for a great price  .
web browser works great , good camera for a phone  .
the reviews complaining about lagging must not have calibrated the phone  .
the at t rep set up my phone in the store while i is waiting for numbers to transfer to another phone and i have had no problems  .
all transitions are smooth .
great phone          cool looks easy , intuitive use  .
i is going to follow the trend of purchasing an iphone when it is time for my upgrade , but instead of spending $150 for that , this phone is offerd for free so after reading reviews i jumped at the offer  .
i received the phone and i have been thrilled ever since (i upgraded from a full qwerty keyboard motorola q global)  .
the virtual keyboard is easy to use and i very rarely mistype , none more than i used to with my old phone  .
the widgets are fantastic , and he 3  .
2 mp camera works very well and has a flash which is a nice touch  .
i do not agree with the previous reviewer who said that the phone has lagging issues , as i have had absolutely no problems navigating through each screen , widget , etc  .
my husband and i are very happy with my purchase , so much so that now my husband is looking to upgrade to this phone also in january since he has seen mine  .
i bought this phone last week when i upgraded my at t plan and i love it  .
i is a little wary at first since my last phone had a dedicated qwerty keyboard (blackjack2)and a non touch screen interface  .
but i took the leap  .
i had to recalibrate the virtual keboard which you should always do anyways and i never have any mistypes  .
the only gripe i had with the virtual keyboard is that the apostrophe key is on a separate symbol keyboard from the alphabet one (there's 3 virtual keyboards total)i use that apostrophe one alot  .
other than that i am more than satisfied  .
i is pleased with the camera flash since my lasst phone didn't have that  .
camera quality is good although the colors are a tad washed out but samsung seems to have that issue on all of their phones  .
its better than most though  .
i have no trouble navigating the 3 menu screens or the 3 home screens  .
i am also very pleased with the speaker quality and volume since the blackjack2 didn't have a very good speaker  .
so far every call i've made is very loud and clear  .
but i haven't made any crazy calls to weird areas so we'll see how that goes later on  .
i like the fact that you can customize the little widget bar on the lefthand side of the screem to add or remove the widgets that you don't use or don't want showing  .
i haven't changed my plan yet to be able to utilize the mobile tv apps but i will soon  .
i'm curious as to how that particular part of the phone does  .
the 3g network in my area is also not that great so it wo not really be able to utilize it to its fullest  .
all in all i am very happy with the samsung mythic and i would definitely recommend it to a friend or anyone really  .
i have only had it about a week so that might change later on but for now love it  .
i hope this helps anyone looking to buy this phone .
i ended up getting this phone from warranty and love it , theres just a couple of minor problems , but overall its outstanding  .
there is one thing i would like to point out i the review , i do not know if there were some duds , but i never have any slowdown in my phones ui  .
the touch screen is large and responsive , and so is the onscreen keyboard .
this is an amazing phone f or anybody  .
i love it there is nothing really that bad about it  .
i recommend this phone for anybody  .
this is my first touchscreen phone and i is leery because of it  .
i looked at the soltice and impression by samsung , but also the motorola karma and pantech  .
i had not been a huge fan of samsung , having owned motorola , nokia and husband has had a string of every new iphone (which is what he thought i should get)  .
my main motivation is that i wanted to ditch att's $30 a month smartphone fee when i didn't use any of the features  .
the main utility features i is looking for included good call quality , ability to im and text , and to check email now and then  .
i wanted a camera , but didn't care about video or sound (and still don't) after now owning the phone for two weeks , i feel confident that i've worked with it enough to know what is good and what is not so hot  .
the touchscreen , as previously complained , is a bit on the dull side in terms of responsiveness  .
sometimes i have no problem , other times it either won't move when i flick it across , or i end up selecting something i don't want  .
i fully agree this could be a problem with the operator  .
the camera is not very intuitive  .
i still have not figured out how to zoom in or out  .
it does take nice pics , and they are in jpeg format so they are easy to share (as opposed to my last phone) in terms of text and im , i am still on the learning curve of not screwing up the keystrokes on the touchscreen without making a lot of spelling mistakes  .
it helps to have fingernails , so i'm not sure how a man would feel about the buttons that way i really wish that i could figure out how to have google calendar send my schedule to my phone  .
if i could work out that kink , i'd be unequivocably happy overall a very good phone and a pleasant surprise .
for the price , it is the best phone for basic browing of web , emails and keeping in    touch through social networking sites .
first off as a telephone , (remember when that is the prime reason to have one of these  .
) , it has outstanding performance  .
the clarity on both ends of the call is quite crisp and has a good volume  .
it is easy to do extensive customizing of the contacts list  .
some have complained that you cannot port your contacts from outlook , but for the casual user i don't think this is a problem  .
some have also complained that the touch screen and menus are sluggish , i think people are trying to compare this to the iphone or ipod touch screens  .
i don't think this is a fair comparison  .
for me the screen reacts as well as most any other non smart phone with a touch screen  .
any problems can be easily solved with a simple stylus available from any number of sources for less than 5 dollars  .
the keys on the virtual qwerty pad are large and easy to use  .
i first tried an lg xenon and found it nearly impossible to use with my fat fingers  .
i can finally actually make the most of my texting plan  .
the camera functions well and comes with a flash  .
i cannot speak to the web or tv service on the phone as i have elected not to purchase the plans to use those features  .
in every sense this is the best non    smart phone i have ever owned  .
perhaps one of the best things about this phone is the accessory package in the box  .
i have in the past been frustrated by companies that required me to buy expensive software and connection cables to link up to my computer  .
with this phone it is all included  .
the software makes it a breeze to transfer photos , music , and ringtones to and from the phone  .
this is a huge bonus if you have ever struggled to figure out how to do these functions without spending another 75 bucks  .
it is quite stylish and sleek , coming in only one color , but in the age of cases of all styles and colors this is hardly worth mentioning  .
i only took 1/2 star off this phone for the fact that one cannot change the lock mode screensavers  .
the phone will cycle through the preloaded wallpapers  .
i solve this by pretty much not locking my phone routinely  .
the second reason for the loss of half a star is the vibration  .
the vibration on this phone does not go as high in intensity as others i have owned  .
it is a slight drawback , but nothing to really detract from the many great features available on this phone  .
i have already recommended it to anyone i know who is looking for a new non    smart phone .
the bottom line is the phone is excellent even though the app transition is sluggish  .
there are so many other great things about this phone that make the sluggishness worth dealing with  .
call quality is around the best you can get and i have had many phones  .
i went from the verizon voyager to this phone  .
i is vary happy with the voyager so the mythic had high expectations to meet  .
the mythis did it with success  .
needs more text message alert opptions , there are only five that come with it  .
i love this phone  .
i got it 2 weeks ago and i am really happy with my choice  .
i wanted an iphone but was not willing to spend $30 on a data plan each month and i think this is a great substitution if you do not want a large phone bill  .
the internet is a little sluggish at times but the rest is great  .
i really urge you to buy this phone if you want a large touch scree , tons of apps and widgets , good call quality and so much more  .
i like the phone alot an its my favorite phone ive ever owned an believe me ive owned several different ones .
over all , i personally love my phone  .
the calls are always clear and crisp  .
the music plays great for a cell phone  .
i do recommend a case and screen protector however  .
i have a bum hand from a stroke and that makes it easier to hold  .
the screen shows both fingerprints and the oil from your face really bad  .
i don't text a lot , but having the touchpad qwerty keyboard makes it a lot easier  .
the keypad takes a little getting used to , but most new items do  .
i like this phone over my wife's impression by far  .
but i do not text like she does  .
i highly recommend this phone  .
great phone for a great price    easy to use and durable .
overall i am very satisfied with this phone  .
being my first touchscreen phone i did alot of reasearch and ended up having to mess around with and choose between the htc pure and the samsung mythic at the at t store  .
i went with the mythic because of its 3  .
5 mm jack , easier to use keyboard , and lower price of data plan the touch screen is quiet responsive and easy to get a hang of  .
as of samsung's touchwiz ui , well it's not a smartphone and is not designed to be one  .
so gettting around and organized on the mythic is not the best experience , but then again i am no business man  .
other than that it's simple and fun to use  .
a feature i really liked is that from your lock screen you can see at a glance if you have any new messages , calls , emails , and social network updates the camera has a led flash which is very bright and usefull  .
(ps if you need a flashlight just start recording a video) the media player is simple and easy to use once you add your files to folders in the phone through the computer  .
it's more organized than adding data to the sd card then inserting into the phone the app selection in the at t store is dismal and dissapointing  .
i'll just stick to surfing the web and music to pass time  .
on that note the web browser which is based off opera is a very nice and capable browser  .
by the way nicole lee i mean no offense but the browser does have multiple zoom settings  .
(just hold your finger down on the screen until you see two arrows then move you finger up to zoom in and down to zoom out  .
no ones fualt but i suppose they dont send ship new phones with user manuels i had to finger that out myself  .
also mobile web and the browser are not the same thing  .
to get to the browser go to the apps icon on you menu for some reason you cannot sign into your windows live account to check your e    mail without subscribing to at t's mobile e    mail 3  .
0 service which is an extra $5 monthly  .
i found this dissapointing but it's still cheaper than paying an iphone data plan or other smartphone data plan battery life is pretty good i've spent the greater part of a 24 hour day web browsing , texting , and am now listening to music and have only worked through 1/5 bars  .
o yes my probably biggest gripe with this phone is that when you light up the then screen while locked it randomly goes through pictures that you cannot change  .
the pictures are nice and bright which show off the screens array of colors and sharpness but i'm not a big fan of having flowers and butterflies as my background  .
i can only hope samsung addresses this later overall this a great multimedia phone  .
this phone plays its role very well and then some  .
at t's social net is great for keeping up with myspace facebook and twitter simultaneously , but at t or samsung needs to bring out some more apps  .
if you reallly seek productivity or just really dont care about prices then go ahead and spend the extra cash .
great if you want good browser functionality , music , but dont need the apps offered in a smartphone , and/or not willing to pay for smartphone service .
this a giant step up from my motorola razr  .
and i do like this phone  .
it's sleek , the touch screen is nice , texting is much faster with the qwerty touch keypad , the camera is good , and overall i am happy with it at this point however , samsung came ___ this close to creating an exceptional phone  .
had they chosen to spend just a little more time in development they would have had a product to rival the iphone .
good phone , well worth the money  .
friends have other new phones and mines the best , thats all their oppions not just mine updated  .
on jan 15 , 2010  .
one of the better new phones to come out for at t this year  .
there's a lot of iphone like features like movable home screen icons , facebook shortcuts and is compatible with at t's 15 dollar data package so you wo not be going broke checking your email  .
ultra colorful display and a easy ui  .
it's a bit sluggish and stubburn when it comes to the touch response and applications and i is kinda bummed to find out the phone only comes in a red (burgandy) color  .
at t has to correct that on their site  .
all in all really cool phone  .
i bought this phone because i wanted to try a touch screen before i invested in an iphone  .
i had been a devoted user of sony ericsson for a long time  .
i like multimedia aspects of phones (photo , video , music , etc)  .
but this phone , everything costs to do it or its not offered  .
i used to be able to take my old phones to concerts and record or take photos and have it be amazing  .
this one , even if you were at the stage , it would look like you were in the back  .
and you need a memory card for it , it fills up so fast  .
the texts are not in chat format , so you end up with thousands of them  .
the widgets are pointless and i wish i could delete them to create more memory space , but you cant  .
i hate their ringtones and you cant make your own unless you only like a second of a song  .
the color would be better in black  .
i'm always charging the battery and i pretty much only text  .
email can only be accessed for an additional $5 a month  .
you cant save internet photos that you have found from browsing and you cant copy and paste anything you type  .
the wallpaper photos are lame and you cant change them or add your own  .
but the one bad thing , if you aren't into fixing your own phone (because we all know at t and their policies when a phone breaks oh you broke it , the phone would never break naturally , ill sell you a new one for more and upgrade your plan and talk you into a longer contract ) the touch screen digitizer , what makes you able to touch the screen and make anything work , breaks before one year so keep updating your contacts on your sim card , photos/videos/texts on your memory card , and do not keep a password to get into your folders (because if you try to connect it to the computer , after the screen goes , it still wants the password that you have no place to type in)  .
you just cant get into your phone unless you replace that part (you can receive calls or call the last person who called , if you want to go veryyyy basic for awhile)  .
you can get the part for $10 on ebay and do it yourself or you can just loose any unsaved info and have them give you another eventual defect  .
i could see maybe a soccer mom liking this phone so she can look cool and take up close pictures of her kids , but not use any of the applications  .
you could by it for your teenager , but you are asking for trouble , if they start activating all the undeletable applications/widgets , your bill is going to be huge  .
if you just use cell phones to call and basic text , maybe check your facebook (not your email) , this is fine  .
but if you are interactive and look at your cell phone as an extension of you and your communication and creative side , this is not the phone  .
go back to the sony ericsson , or bite the financial bullet and buy the iphone  .
btw , the ericsson just came out with a touch phone , when this one breaks again , i'm going to that .
bottom line   great samsung phone , but i really wish it were prepaid    net10 for that matter  .
my sister brags about how wonderful her net10 service is and how it even has a website , net10laughoff  .
com , to win a cash prize  .
she has a samsung phone on this service and i is wondering if this mythic can be available as prepaid too  .
the mythic seems like a great phone  .
the more i messed with it the more i liked it  .
however , this is only a gsm triband phone  .
while the mythic is the more advanced phone in nearly every way (tech    wise) the solstice is a quad    band {wcdma (umts) / gsm 850/900/1800/1900} phone  .
this makes no sense to me  .
being tri    band puts it too far behind the curve for my liking .
i had to replace my favorite phone ever (pantech c150)  .
it broke and they don't make it anymore  .
i loved that phone because it is so slim and small and basic  .
the mythic came closest in size and met my requirements of , no required data plans and must fit in my tiny purse or pocket  .
i simply don't need or want 99% of what the phone has on it , but the market seems to be demanding the bells and whistles , so i get them too  .
the tv feature is nonsense to me  .
i watch shows on my 52 tv at home (i don't really do that very much either)  .
as for the apps and browser , i wish i could just delete it all  .
thankfully , i have the little widget thing that lets me access my frequent use items    music player , messaging , and memos  .
i just wish that touch screen is more responsive  .
since i walk my dog a lot , the music player is really what drove me to this phone  .
now i do not have to carry two devices  .
when the phone is in my pocket , i love the voice recognition  .
i can check time and make calls without having to touch the phone  .
it also transitions nicely from music to taking a call , then back to music note on the battery   everything about the battery life seemed fine until suddenly one day it started draining really fast  .
i worried that i might have inadvertently started an app or the browser  .
i checked the manual and made sure i had hit the end button to completely stop my music player  .
in the end , what i discovered is that my bluetooth stays active even after i stop the music player  .
how did i know , you ask  .
i had the volume on the phone and the headset all the way up because i had been outside  .
when i stopped the player , i could still hear the open line through my headset  .
basically , this runs down the battery as if i'm on an active phone call  .
somehow the phone gives the headset a command to end call when you make a phone call , but it's not giving a notification when the player is ended  .
when i'm done listening to music and hit the end button , i now do a quick phone function like check time with the voice feature  .
this gives the headset a clear end command that sends it back into standby  .
i no longer have battery issues .
good phone overall with some bad features  .
this phone suck just in genrel  .
i purchased this phone because i wanted a camera to replace my samsung sgh    d900 (see my review) which i sorely miss (still functional but weak signal strength)  .
anyways , i have had this phone since early feb (2 1/2 months) as my 1st touch screen  .
not a fan but a side of that , i hate this phone  .
you can run most pix , video , mp3's from the memory card which helps but sounds/songs of any length are too large to use as ringtones , alarm tones , etc  .
you must compress the file in to small bits of sound  .
pictures in macro mode look clear but still require the camera to focus  .
other option is af mode which takes at least 2 seconds of not moving to take a picture  .
you cannot take a moving object  .
other camera options allow you to edit/add to the photo but your hand or the object must always be stationary  .
i loved samsung for their shortcut buttons from previous phones (this model is locked with call , messaging , mobile web , music player , games end all) i used calculator , calender , new message and alarm (widgets that do not fill all on one screen)  .
yes , there are 3 widget screens that you can scroll thru (like iphone) they have pictures in the background  .
then you have a memu button which brings you to 3 more screens (full of apps)  .
if you buy or add more apps you may have more windows  .
these apps mimic some of the widgets that you can customize he 1st set of windows with  .
speaking of widgets , 10 of the 32 require data use (just a warning , 3 are clocks 7 are memo pads)  .
confused  .
i is too because there are 5 ways to create a text and more than 1 way to do everything else  .
if you like that great , but most ways require multiple buttons so it could get confusing either way  .
other rants (silent using volume toggle , sound profile mode or key pad # button) , memos are limited to 100 characters (up to 100 memos too) , when you lock the phone and are not on the main widget screen , if you receive a text/missed call/voice mail , you must back out or end all to get to the memu bar that lists the inbox/call log  .
customizable vibration and vibration levels are nice but you really cannot tell the difference on your hip and the highest setting is still weaker than my other samsungs  .
cannot use camera flash as a flashlight , charging port is at the top , must remove back panel to access memory card , no operations manual (cd    rom provides the link to the internet which shows you how to use the phone) , alarm snooze has a swivel button to turn it off but you can also shut off the alarm (accidentally) using all other buttons (volume rocker , talk , back , end , lock , camera shutter or shortcut) , address book contact info (birthdays) do not merge to the calender (no option to add) , cannot check a text while on the phone , phone cannot multi    task well  .
it will freeze up for a second if you receive a text while doing something else , but it will remember how many times you hit the button if you tried to press the buttons again when it froze  .
you cannot use the volume rocker to scroll down to read a long text  .
volume rocker changes the font size up and down  .
i have old text messages from the previous phones but they are useless for dates because the phone does not display the year , only month and day the text is received  .
lastly , if video resolution doesnt match the video display , you cannot view them (i  .
i can store the videos from other phones/files , but cannot view them)  .
i could say some good about this phone like the helpful id bar in locked mode and the tactile vibrations when typing but i am not trying to sell this phone to anyone who is not going to use a data plan  .
all games and even the web tv (a primary feature of this phone) use the demo or require data use  .
my bill ends up $0  .
50    $1  .
00 higher by virtue of clicking on a button/app that loads to the internet  .
contact me if you want to know more but i am thoroughly frustrated on a daily basis  .
all i want is a phone that dials and takes good pictures with flash  .
this did not do it for me  .
egirxbass@gmail  .
com  .
my biggest issues with this phone are the menu setups , and attempting to text  .
the mythic had good intentions of being customizable like the iphone without needing the data plan , but it seems as if they tried too hard and made it a little too complex to find anything in those menus i still have yet to figure out how to change my locked screen wallpaper and the sound profile menu is pointless  .
i don't need different settings for driving or outdoors  .
i want normal settings like vibrate , silent , or something along those lines  .
also trying to text is nearly impossible if you do not have super skinny fingers , or are trained well to touchscreen texting  .
the full keyboard is really close together and you mess up a lot  .
and there really is no messaging menu , you can go to your inbox/outbox , but if you want to make a new message , you have to exit out and find the icon wherever you decided to put in on your home screen  .
again , the menus just being a little too inconvenient overall , i would not chose this phone , if you like how this one looks , do yourself a favor and get the samsung impression instead  .
it's almost the same , just minus the headphone and mobile tv , and it has a physical full keyboard updated  .
on apr 3 , 2010  .
i is really excited to get this phone at first  .
the vivid display is extremely appealing and the phone looks very sleek  .
however , after just 6 months , i cannot stand it anymore  .
i have recently switched to the lg xenon , which is actually a less advanced phone , but it's working so much better the biggest 2 problems with the mythic are that (1) it will shut off by itself and (2) refuse to call/send texts at random times (1) after about 3 months with the phone , the restarting thing started happening  .
now it occurs no less than 5 times a day  .
when i push any button (unlock , call , menu , anything) , there is a chance of the phone shutting off (2) also , the phone will refuse to call or send/receive any texts for intervals of up to an hour  .
if i try to dial , it will say emergency calls only  .
texts just do not send  .
i've tried restarting my phone many times , taking out the battery and putting it back in , etc whenever this happens  .
nothing helps  .
you just have to wait it out other than these , the other problems are slightly more acceptable  .
the directional sense of the phone can be very irritating  .
it is slow to recognize that you have switched from viewing it vertically to horizontally , and vice versa  .
also , the touchscreen qwerty takes some getting used to , but that goes for all touchscreen keyboards  .
another small thing is that the phone has some weird directional sense when you are looking at your pictures (it assumes that every picture is taken horizontally so if you have a vertical picture , it will automatically make it horizontal , so you have to look at it sideways)  .
also , the camera does not have zoom , but in general the picture quality is pretty good  .
one last thing is that texts are not in a chat format on this phone , which most newer smart phones do bottom line   i do not recommend this phone , especially if you're a heavy cell phone user .
i've had the phone since around november 2009 , and i'm on my third one , and this one is just about to get sent back as well  .
the first phone withstood being dropped , stuffed in my bra for over an hour at a time while i is on it using my blue tooth , and being stuffed in my purse ; i is actually very impressed , until the screen started acting up  .
i would try to push the 3 and it would push the 2  .
it did this a few times and would fix itself , but it just got annoying , so i called at t and they sent me a replacement , which is actually a refurb  .
needless to say this new phone is sent back after less than a month because it had completely locked up on me for no reason  .
i got my third phone , and so far it's been okay , but it seems to have trouble recognizing what i push when i text  .
it either skips letters , or types the wrong ones  .
and the back space button will not erase , but will mistype an l  .
my fingers aren't that big and i have nails , so this should not be a problem  .
the biggest problem i have with it is that it will give me an unexpected failure message over and over and over again when i try to post a status message on facebook  .
it drives me friggin' nuts  .
i have to hit the post button up to 10 times before it finally goes through  .
and i cannot check my bank account at all , or the phone shuts right off  .
i have never had any of these problems before , not even with the motorazr , or the samsung impression  .
i stick with at t because my family all has it , but i've seriously considered switching services because other providers offer better phones  .
in fact i think at t seems to be at the bottom of the technology totem pole , when it comes to anything  .
the only thing they have going for them is the iphone , and even that has been out performed by phones running android  .
over all i think the mythic is garbage , but it does have some good qualities , and has been good to me for the most part so far  .
i don't recommend this phone to anyone who does a lot of business on their phone , or anyone who is in a hurry  .
if you cannot be patient with the phone , then you should not buy it  .
i do not mind the girly unchangeable locked backgrounds , though it is annoying not being able to customize these things  .
and so far this is the only thing i have come across that i cannot customize  .
if i think of anything else i will add it , but for now this is all i have to say .
well this is my third phone ever  .
i started with a tracfone , then i got on plan with my family and i had a razr  .
now i'm a new plan with a friend and i received this phone  .
sure its a nice upgrade from a razr , but once you've had it for a couple months , its not as great as you thought  .
it's great for size and weight , color , volume , and such , but for being in a smart phone category , it lacks severely  .
you can choose form just a few widgets  .
the web browsing on the phone is just horrible , and can constantly tell you that there is an unexpected error  .
occasionally (though it seems to happen all the time) when you exit a browser , your phone will freeze , leaving the only way to turn it off by taking out the battery  .
i find this very frustrating  .
the phone also tends to have average to poor service , which becomes irritating  .
i must admit i love the various ways to text , and make calls , it also offers a great multi task button  .
the phones easy layout allows your fingers the ability to glide across it easily , and can make for speedy texting  .
though the menus can become a hassle , having to got through many just to get tone one  .
this phone does not offer many widgets or useful ones i should say , especially for its three page homepage layout  .
its locking locking feature has a picture that constantly changes and wont allow you to customize it  .
if you're looking for a phone to personalize , i'm sorry but you're looking at the wrong one  .
i like the phone to a certain degree , but its not for me personally  .
it's just a basic touchscreen  .
the battery life is absolutely horrible  .
anything you do will suck it dry  .
you'll be lucky if it lasts you a day  .
once it gets to two bars of battery life you have a half hour left at least , because it will soon enter low battery mode  .
in the end it is nice to upgrade from a razr but this phone makes me want a new one  .
it's just not me , it might suit someone out there , but for customization and a true smart phone i'll have to find something else  .
another thing , you have to constantly get upgrades for the phone  .
i dont think the phone is personally worth it , unless you're giving it to your teenage kid  .
hope my review helps , i'm sure i'm missing something but this is spur of the moment updated  .
on jul 5 , 2010  .
i am very unhappy with this phone  .
i am in the information technology field and have no problem learning new electronics and is expecting to be blown away by this release but is sadly disappointed  .
to go into more detail on my cons as everyone else has already mentioned , you cannot change the screensaver once the phone is locked it flips through all of the backgrounds that are available on the phone , including butterflies and some other girly ones i agree with another user that if you were wanting this phone for business use , it's not professional at all  .
the battery life is horrible and not to mention you have about a total of 5 mins after it says low battery before it completely shuts off i did really ike a couple of the ringtones/alert tones , however there were very little to choose from to begin with  .
while texting , there's a neat feature where if you space twice it automatically creates a period as you would at the end of a sentence however , the phone is not smart enough to recognize when you've already used a punctuation mark such as a question mark or exclamation and still adds a period  .
not only that but if you delete the period and double space again , it does it again (blackberry has the function as well but if you delete it once it's smart enough to realize you probably didn't want it there and allows you to double space again without adding a period again) the camera is pretty decent and the editing features on the phone are pretty cool  .
the scroll feature on the touch screen is absolutely horrible it didn't matter how hard or softly you touched the screen or with how much or little of your finger , it would always select the wrong thing or open the wrong thing i've worked with iphones before and the scroll on them is much much much more accurate the main menu (there are 3) sucks because they stick 2 pages full of apps that you can only use if you pay $5 here and $10 here and $3 there for each (menus 1 and 2) and you cannot edit the order of them , so no matter what , when you need to get to something you actually need or that is useful (ie , settings , tools , etc) you have to scroll through (good luck) to the 3rd flipping menu before you can get to them the widget bar is pretty much pointless , you add things to it , so when you need to get to them , you click the widget bar (to open it up) then click the icon you want , then the icon is placed on your main screen , then you have to click the icon that's been moved to your main screen before you can actually use the widget i mean come on , that's 3 clicks for something i should only have to click once for as you can see , simply not the phone for me for those of you that like it , enjoy , for those of you that haven't bought it yet , do not .
i can look past the majority of the cons that i listed above  .
but the one thing i cannot forgive the makers of this phone for is the god    awful texting functions  .
without a doubt the worst full qwerty keypad i've ever used  .
unless you have super thin , pointy fingers texting on this phone will be a nightmare  .
so for most men , if you text a lot , this phone is a no    go  .
the keys are too small , the space bar is too small and positioned left of center so if you're right handed and you normally use your thumb to hit the space bar then you will constantly be hitting the  .
key or the b key  .
i spend more time backspacing on this phone than any other i've used  .
and the t9 function on this phone is awful  .
simple words that we use on a daily basis are not in this phone's memory  .
and unlike other phones , even if you constantly use a word that's not in its memory the phone will not remember that word for future use  .
i cannot wait to unload this phone .
it doesn't let you know if the phone is charging when you plug it in  .
i have already had to swap it out for another mythic because the first one is such crap  .
it wouldn't shut down , it would simply restart  .
or i would get the green screen of death and it would freeze , forcing me to take the battery out  .
then while i would talk to someone a weird gray box would show up on it's own , saying please press the lock key to use in call functions  .
it would prohibit me from hearing the person on the other end , or from them hearing me , unless i put my phone on speaker  .
i hate all the icons , and how annoying it is to move them around , and it's dumb that you cannot delete them if you do not want them there  .
the texting set up is way annoying , it takes ages to write a text message  .
you have to push really hard to get the phone to recognize that you are typing , it's not sensitive like an ipod touch or iphone  .
there is no zoom on the camera either , it's so frustrating  .
oh i hate this phone , and now i'm stuck with one for two years unless i want to pay full price for something else  .
what a pile of crap .
why would you but this phone when you can just get the samsung eternity  .
the battery life is 3x longer and it is half the price  .
the operating system is much smoother and everything else is pretty much the same  .
unfortunately for the mythic , the eternity is older and is excused from not having the best features and the most user    friendly operating system  .
the mythic , however , has no excuse for the annoyingly laggy responsiveness and for the amount of third    party software that comes pre    loaded on the phone this phone has no battery life to speak of and it is out    performed by an older , and cheaper , competitor  .
i have to say shame on you to cnet for giving this garbage a good review .
you might as well go with the i phone because you have to get an unlimited data plan anyway  .
plus there are a ton of apps for the i phone  .
i would also look into the verizon droid .
i've had this phone for three months now  .
very unhappy with it  .
call reception is poor  .
a lot of places i cannot even get reception when my wife's iphone will  .
the touch screen is picky  .
most of the apps that came with the phone require a subscription , while the free ones either don't work or are just free trials the battery is terrible  .
when i first got it , it would hold a charge for about 48 hours  .
now , it wo not hold a charge for 24 hours the only thing i really like about this phone is it's bright , readable screen  .
but that's not enough to keep this phone for  .
i'm trading it in .
the phone is very confusing and not very user friendly  .
after a week i thought i had it figured it out only to still not be able to type on the key board , (still a month later i cannot figure it out completly)  .
four days ago the icon for the moblie tv keeps showing on the screen  .
i've never subscribed to mobile tv app  .
app keeps draining the battery and have to have another charge every 8 hours att could not figure it out and gave me the number to samsung customer service  .
i called samsung customer service and talked to mark and he said i could mail it to get it diagnosed  .
wait time for the service is 5    10 buisness days  .
samsung has no phone loaner program and directed me to call att and ask them how many of you could go 5    10 buisness days w/o a phone only one month after purchesing a highly recommended phone .
wanted to like this phone with its great features , but am so frustrated , i just want to throw it  .
tv is the selling point , but now that i've had the phone 3 weeks and working with it , the touch screen is so unresponsive (even after being calibrated) that i cannot accept calls in time before the caller hangs up  .
scrolling through the contact list , it doesn't stop on the name i want , but it dials a name i don't want  .
why cannot it confirm if that's the contact i want before it dials it  .
and those widget icons keep popping out and loading up on the screen when i don't want them  .
my plan does not include apps , and mythic doesn't allow me to exclude them from the widget list  .
the lockscreen , cycling wallpapers are a nuisance , when you set shortcuts on the touchscreen ; so if you try to use the touch shortcuts , then the wallpaper starts scrolling to the next one and the next one  .
samsung , you tried to put too many features on this phone and several do not work the way you would expect for the price of $150 with a 2    year contract  .
i'll be exchanging the mythic for another model .
if your eligible for an upgrade through at t and want a touchscreen phone the iphone and some htc's offer a superior experience to the mythic or  .
if you want a phone similar to a smart phone without the pda plan chose a phone not using samsung's abysmal proprietary software and better build quality such as the motorola karma .
cannot seem to master the art of scrolling through the widgets w/o inadvertently selecting widgets pc studio for the mythic does not support download of contacts  .
is advised by 1 support person to use pc studio for solstice but the next support person said i cannot do that and that he is going to report the previous one for telling me that  .
i did get my contacts from outlook to mythic using pc studio for solstice  .
media transfer using pc studio has been terrible  .
i see today that there is a faq that describes using other tools , which i will try because i'll never get my paltry 800 titles on the phone with pc studio  .
phone doesn't connect to pc most of the time  .
it has never been recognized by pc as a device , only occasionally by pc studio (i'll try another pc sometime)  .
made 5 calls to support to get it connected and they never helped  .
i accidently got it to connect and have occasionally been able to do so since  .
when copying music i get an error at least 50% of the time (pc studio)  .
hopefully the alternative methods will work but they depend on the phone being recognized by the pc support personnel are very nice but i think they are hamstrung by a poor phone and poor tools  .
i is advised to uninstall/install pc studio several times  .
pc studio puts 14 rows in win xp programs list and the provided uninstall removes 1 of them internet access works but hardly anything is readable and you have to click with a fingernail because list are crammed together  .
very difficult to effectively use email works    that is my primary purpose for the phone other than calls  .
i can connect to hotmail , gmail and i have set up another account that is supported through my consulting business web site provider  .
this seems to work well  .
do not bother with the emails with graphics , though  .
great for normal personal or business text emails bite the bullet and get an iphone  .
i tried one and even with it's difficiencies it blows away this phone , even with the moderate extra cost (it looks like i'll be paying $20/month for data and email with this phone and it is $30 for iphone) .
save yourself the trouble buy a different phone or use another service  .
i am going to go to another provider when this contract is up  .
at t does not stand behind their products  .
this phone is good for women in their 40s who want a touch screen phone but are too cheap to buy an iphone .
i loathe this phone and cannot wait to get one that works  .
very disappointed in this phone .
if you lose your password or forget it you are screwed  .
your phone is rendered inoperable (unlike all other samsungs and every other brand on the market)  .
if some smart ass borrows your phone they can easily sabotage it in a few keystrokes so that next time you power it off your phone basically becomes a brick  .
buy a different samsung but not this one  .
do not purchase this phone , ever  .
it blows my mind that this phone managed to get approved for consumption by the general public  .
i honestly wonder if anyone actually works at samsung , as this phone appears to have been designed by monkeys  .
furthermore , i cannot believe it has a score as high as it does on cnet  .
pure trash  .
anyone who had a part in the design of this phone   pat yourself on the back , you are truly inept .
if i could , i would have given 0 stars  .
i do not understand why nicole did not address seriously about how slow the menu was  .
in fact , the touch screen response is so slow while i is changing menu pages  .
this is a serious problem for phone like this because this is a touch screen phone  .
the menu transition from one to another also showed a lag  .
when i say lag , i really mean it  .
the price of this phone is 199  .
99 dollars with 2 year contract after 50 dollars mail and rebate  .
i am not willing to overlook all of these issues with a high price tag like this  .
when you can get blackberry curve or iphone for around 100 dollars , this is just absurd  .
if you worry about data package , then fine  .
go for samsung impression with texting , or go for samsung solstice for porting  .
this phone is most unresponsive phone i have ever played with .
