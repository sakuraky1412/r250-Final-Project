i found genuine microsoft windows xp professional with a href   http  //www  .

tek    micro  .

com/products/microsoft    windows    xp    professional    sp3    %252d    full    version    w%7b47%7d    coa  .

html sp3 /a sp3 for only $104  .

99 and free shipping here    .

i got my copy  .

it is fast shipping and came with a genuine disk and genuine coa  .

cannot beat this deal  .

this is made after the booming economy when people saw it  .

it made people happy all over again  .

i do not know maybe middle easterns are programing ms products it seems that ms has been f@#king us after the bombing of 911  .

it only makes sense over xbox live how many middle do you here i had it for about 4 months i heard none , zip , zero , yet many have great jobs in the tech industry and there monitoring the internet  .

many work at cisco systems  .

i'm from silicon valley i know what i'm typing about  .

peace  .

this os is much better than the apple os and if you don't think so , you have a severely messed up brain , or you do not know how to us a computer .

hopefully vista can show time when the computer is locked , and when ur logged out  .

also , built in alarm would be nice  .

my computer is forever on  .

windows hasnt crashed on my new hardware yet  .

abit had some issues on it lst few motherboards  .

runs like it should  .

as always , windows is always more responsive than any other os i try  .

xandros , linspire , kubuntu , ubuntu , suse , redhat/fedora core , dsl , and debian  .

microsoft is definitely trained in the art of voodoo coding  .

cause their stuff works like magic  .

and in ways u would never think possible or logical  .

i love it  .

and cant wait for vista  .

getting it is definitely on my new years resolution list  .

woot woot  .

if you want power and speed pick windows xp  .

your games will fly and your benchmarks will rock .

winxp pro    kaput to win98se  .

winxp pro    2x the kaput to win2000  .

winxp pro    8x the kaput to winme  .

winxp pro    infinity kaput to win95 and less .

ok , i wrote an opinion earlier (03    03) and now i'm back  .

i've used every windows os now and got back to xp  .

it's true that it takes over 2 minutes to completely startup and yes the drive is doing things i don't ask for but besides that it's the best os i've ever had  .

never crashes , makes me almost being bored because i do not have to fix it  .

so my opinion garbage is to early stated  .

it's ok , in fact it's perfect .

go buy it  .

this os rocks  .

here are some things you should read  .

ignore the hands down user's they are so stupid that every computer they assemble , install has problems  .

i hate those thumb down people makes me wana throw rocks on them 2  .

this os just works  .

dont switch to mac  .

they just want you'r money  .

when you can buy a dell for $599  .

or assemble you'r own it will be cheaper  .

i give it 10 out of 10  .

good job bill gates  .

the best i tell you it's the best  .

a fresh clean install on my computer took about 15 minutes and vroom  .

xp on you'r computer installed  .

i enjoy games better than win98 my favorite are sof2 and mohaa  .

believe me people it is worth it belive me  .

enjoy xp on you'r computer  .

hurray bill gates  .

the best microsoft windows ever made iv'e been a mac user 2 year  .

then i switch xp is beutifull  .

i reccomend it i will give 10  .

windows xp has given me the power to do things i never could have done with windows 98  .

i can instant message my friends , play online games and not have to worry about my cumputer crashing when i is in the middle of something important .

windows xp has been running on my old pii 450 for quite some time with zero problems  .

no crashes , no freezes , no blue screens of death  .

xp is an excellent os with many features  .

for those reviewers with running into problems , you should try to do a clean install  .

installing one os on top of another will always lead to issues .

never crashed , no glitches , no blue screens , if your system cannot handle it , then upgrade and buy one that can , throw your out    of    date system in the trash or donate it to someone not so lucky as your self quit crying , do your research , know what your getting into , quit blaming microsoft xp ps  .

one mans junck is anothers treasure  .

my xp operating install is easy , it picked up my old hp    4c scanner , my very old hp    iiip printer and both epson ink jets 740 , 820 on usb  .

i now have three printer on one computer  .

glad to give up my win 98 , 98se , winme systems .

you people that complain of instablility make me laugh  .

this product's kernel (the core of the operating system) has very little difference from windows 2000 (xp is nt 5  .

1 , 2000 is nt 5  .

the stability is excellent and so are the features  .

i found the interface to be a bit hokey , but if you go to http  //www  .

themexp  .

org you can find a theme to fit your tast just fine  .

with xp , microsoft finally got rid of the horrible win 9x memory issues and switched all versions of windows to the more efficient and stable windows nt engine  .

true that some hardware is not compatible (at least not yet , check your hardware manufacturer frequently , as they may be developing the drivers still) with xp , but the same can be said for every major upgrade in operating system history  .

i've installed this os on countless machines , never had a problem with one  .

i personally use it very intensly everyday for programming , video editing , imaging , gaming , surfing and more i've never had a hitch  .

and i can say that i will never go back to win98 or 2000  .

as far as the software incompatibilities go , those are the responsibilities of the software vendors  .

they've had access to windows xp for months before the public did , so they had time to address these issues  .

it has nothing to do with the instablilty of the os  .

windows xp is by far the best os that micro$oft has put out  .

no if only their server version of xp would hurry and get released .

stop the crying  .

everyone should know not to do the upgrade  .

if full install is used xp is very stable  .

lets be truthful linux users even you have to admit its pretty good .

is running windows 2000 pro  .

before i upgraded to xp pro  .

and i have had nothing but success running xp  .

the speed and features are faster snd i have had no problems at all  .

did have to download my printer driver off of the enternet , but that is no problem  .

every thing works great and i would upgrade again .

we have to give it to them this time  .

xp pro is a true os  .

the most stable up to date  .

do a clean install , not an upgrade  .

also a word for the disbelievers and disappointed  .

first sit down and write a gui os that counts about 1 , 000 , 000 lines of code and then start making comments  .

admit it , it is good , even for you .

this is it xp pro is top of the line and the most stable os for any pc .

it is defiantly the best os ever  .

it never crashes and is so powerful  .

i cannot believe anyone would have second thoughts on upgrading .

quality    this os seems very solid  .

the instal is fast the activation is painless  .

features    their are a lot of new features some not need and others work perfect with the os  .

like remote desktop i use this all the time very helpfull  .

cd burning is nice , but i still use other programs for more advance burning  .

the new taskbar and start menu make sense they alone have some nice features worth checking out  .

stability    it has been a champ i is hanging up a least 10 times a week in me  .

i havent had any problems except aol  .

aol 7  .

0 runs funny when trying to download a lot of programs  .

it is also alot eaiser to quit a program now  .

support    i have not had to call , but the help files have come along way from the days of 95  .

my only complaint has to be pricing  .

oh i'm running xp on a piii    700mhz 320 megs ram and 20gig hd  .

not the best system , but runs xp great  .

i is involved in the beta process , and this time microsoft listened to us  .

the result is a stable upgrade that will run well on a large number of systems great job bill  .

what an improvement over windows me in stability and everything  .

this has to be the best os yet  .

as probably most end user , i is used to win98 and winme and i think the review forgets to mention something   win xp is extremly stable  .

i have running the os for the last 10 days and i did not have to reboot once  .

it's amazing  .

i read that it's based on win2k (not sure what that means) but just for the stability it's worth the upgrade  .

i think it's awesome product  .

i , like probably every other computer user out there , is skeptical of windows xp when it debuted in 2001  .

after all , my cherished 98 second edition is more than adequate , right  .

i had a dos prompt at my beckon call (perfect for red baron and virtual snooker) , being on dial    up meant that i is rarely exposed to the ravages of the internet , and when i was , i had norton antivirus and the spy sweeper to keep my computer clean of malware and viruses so imagine my surprise when i finally ponied up $300 for a copy of xp professional for my ever    aging amd    based compaq desktop  .

at a meager 533 mhz i feared xp would be as slow as roofing tar in december  .

i is quite surprised to learn that the contrary is true  .

it hardly flew , but it is quite fast for the hardware xp features what some have dubbed the bozo the clown interface ; others call it the fisher    price interface ; still others (namely microsoft and the non    sarcastic among us) call it luna  .

the bright blue interface has many detractors , but about as many supporters  .

i rather enjoy the cheery blue interface , as it brings a highlight to my day of cycling throughout wordperfect , firefox , excel 97 , and cygwin  .

sometimes i can make myself even forget that i'm using windows make no mistake   it's not apple's mac os x , with the interface that steve jobs himself said he wanted to look lickable  .

nor is it one of the interfaces from linux , namely the keramik of kde or the clearlooks of gnome  .

it's distinctly microsoft , for good or bad in sum , windows xp has proven itself to be something over its life from 2001 to now  .

looking at it through the lens of mac os x or microsoft's own windows vista , it may look dated , technically inferior , and even hard to use , but though i'm a mac and linux fanatic , windows is still my operating system of choice when i want to get productive  .

it's just too bad microsoft is the company who makes it .

os x is still heavily better , but xp pro is amazing as well  .

i currently use it as a file server running on a compaq with 512mb of ram and 60gb hd and amd 64 athlon processor  .

it's pretty fast  .

it is an excellent networking option  .

totally blows away home edition  .

does not nag to set up a passport account  .

no nagging to install norton  .

runs fast , no major complaints  .

i would not recommend using it below 384mb  .

otherwise , it is fast and fairly secure if you have the right virus protection  .

i currently use avast antivirus and spyware terminator to keep it safe , no viruses yet  .

xp pro is great  .

love it    .

so kick butt  .

this os just like xp home is great , but if the computer is by itself or you have a home network w/o a server class os it is not needed , thought you can do remote desktop connection on it .

i do not know what the negative people are talking about  .

i got a new computer and put xp on it  .

it is glitchy in the begining but it turned out to be a faulty connection on my printer  .

i have had no problems with xp  .

hey , maybe i just got lucky , but i call em as i see em .

when i upgraded my system from win98se i chose winxphome  .

after building a new pc i decided to go pro and i am glad i did  .

i do alot of photo editing and d/l of music  .

this is the way to go and sp2 makes it even better  .

don't believe the hype about problems with sp2 , if you follow instructions before d/ling you wo not have a problem  .

now waiting on longhorn  .

the best os so far  .

with excellent compatibility , drivers galore and fast boot times  .

windows xp is the one and only  .

windows xp professional is very stable compared to any other os i've tried  .

especcially windows me , which is what i had before this  .

i suggest partitioning your hard drive with windows 98 se to play or use all the uncompatible products .

windows xp pro is a vast improvment over previous version of windows from microsoft  .

along with hundreds of changes , extensive shell modifications , and sqillions of user and business requests and recomendations , with requests added in  .

for all those out there that say winxp is not a winner , and win98se is still the king of the hill , winxp pro has a 76% stability increase over win98se with extensive grafts , and migrations from windows 2000 pro sp2 , windows xp pro is the answer to all those that want reliabilty , stability and performence  .

and to whomever said win2000xxx drivers do not work on winxp pro  .

microsoft drivers , for every single  .

dll firmware , and all other needs are available from the winxp pro support page  .

i own all windows releases , along with a number of oem versions , preinstalled applications , and other terminals , and can safely say , with the full backing of my peers that windowsxp pro is the future .

my only beef is the lack of available xp drivers for a lot of applications  .

you probably need to add $200 or so for software updates if you have older toys apps .

marz's little diatribe a few reviews down is nice and cute , but it is taking it a little too far  .

product activation does not spy on you , it does not control your computer  .

all it does is take 10 hardware factors (such as ram , cpu , etc ) , create a profile out of them , and assign the profiles to the registration code  .

when an attempt is made to activate a previously activated number , all that it does is make another profile , send it to ms's servers , and see if they match (within certain limits with number of changes and time i believe its something like 3 changes every 3    6 months  .

) if not , a call to tech support (something i had to do , as i is building a computer and bareboned it first) will have everything fixed in under 5 minutes (and i called at 3 am)  .

they are not taking away rights , they are not big brother , give it up  .

there are plenty of companies that participate in shadier activities  .

someone finally came up with a way to stop software fraud , and even though it impacts me , i applaud them  .

this is a very stable os , have not had one problem with it  .

if you are thinking of getting it though , check for hardware drivers ahead of time  .

some companies (like ati) have released newer versions than the ones on the installation disk .

just a thought for all of you out there griping about xp windows xp and mac os x 10  .

1 both have the same system requirements (go figure)  .

large os's require resources  .

if your computer cannot handle the os , go to a linux system  .

oh , and by the way , who is forcing you to use this os and don't tell me microsoft  .

you have so many os's to pick from right now  .

that is why microsoft wants everything to be based on nt technology the only way they can build a stable os to compete  .

so if all the whiners out there are through , i will state that xp is the latest and greatest of ms os's  .

it is very stable and worth the upgrade if you can afford it  .

it does require newer hardware , but i would rather have a new os on my new computer that i put together to optimize my new investment  .

and one more point , windows 2k didn't start off perfect on drivers either  .

i bet windows xp will fall in line with this  .

a year from now everyone will be praising xp  .

i would say buy the os if you realize that some older software and hardware may not work (2    3 years or older)  .

it is built on nt technology so most of the people on here griping do not realize that  .

whole new os heading in the right direction  .

it is worth the cost in my opinion .

in my pc it works great but the conncetions speed with my isp is slow (33  .

6) but when i install win me/98 the conncetions speed is high i think i should download the drivers for my modem  .

i have a 266 mhz celeron with 63 mb ram and against my friend's better advice i decided to get xp  .

it runs wonderfully with very few slow downa and those only seem to occur when using some of the new xp features such and the new program monitoring and such things  .

it is a very worthwhile upgrade even for those that dont exactly meet the system requirements  .

stable on two weeks of non stop run the o  .

s and not a problem with the software .

windows is a very good os  .

windows is very popular so many people think its cool to be antimicrosoft but i think windows is wonderful  .

its compatible to every piece of hardware ive tried to put in it  .

it compatible with all the software i put on it  .

and what i think makes windows the best is the startmenu/taskbar  .

works better than a dock  .

now people say its a horrible os because there are alot of viruses but since most people use windows , so most hackers want there product (malware) to work and effect alot of people thats why so many hackers try hacking windows and not osx .

i seem to have good luck with me of all 9x's , it is best  .

i like win2k (nt5) very much  .

but , i could not run several s/w programs on win2k and no 9x is as stable as nt5  .

xp has arrived and i have the best of both worlds  .

yes , it is still nt5  .

x something  .

a win2k    expanded    i guess to have me like abilities merged into the stable ntfs  .

anyway , great  .

so far , any crash has not been the fault of windows and always easily fixed  .

xp returns to stability  .

all other problems seem to work themselves out  .

i could not use the run , search , and help in one or two profiles on two xp pro computers in the new start menu ; had to use classic  .

other profiles on same computers worked  .

why  .

who knows have to buy one for one  .

homes have multiple computers now  .

most will not shell out  .

people will still use the older stuff as long as possible & like us  .

as long as my remaining mes , win2k , and office 2000 products work , most of our computers will not be upgraded for a long time .

there's nothing more annoying when people's own incompetence is the cause of a crash    prone o/s  .

people muck about , and naturally things bad can happen  .

about 10% of pc faults (i've found out in the job i'm in) are down to the o/s naturally being buggy  .

windows xp home and pro aren't buggy  .

if you're not experienced enought to do something    don't do it  .

if your computer is crashing replace all the drivers even if the ones you have are the newest    and install again the newest ones from a website or from the xp cd  .

if you've graphics problems and haven't installed directx9 , get directx 8  .

2 from microsoft's website (called directplay 8  .

2 , but includes directx 8  .

2 update)    if your computer's okay i'd turn off system restore  .

please just do not think negative things of xp because of your experience , it really has had a lot of work put it in it    and it is not ; i can clarify through my work as a software engineer , a spyware o/s  .

this o/s is certainly the best windows o/s yet and i thoroughly reccomend people who wish to , to try it  .

thanks , james  .

with a celeron 400mhz , 352mb of ram , and a pretty rubbish computer system in general it's perfectly fine for internet browsing with my cable modem , and it does fine for running programs etc  .

unfortunately no graphics card so cannot comment on it's usefullness for gaming  .

if anybody has a problem it's because you've not set up your hardware right  .

for most people it should be a case of run it and that's it  .

i removed all the stupid looks it defaults with , and it now runs as fast as windows 98 did  .

sometimes i consider going back    do i really need xp  .

well to be honest yes ; it's stable , never crashes , you can restart networking without restarting the computer  .

it's most user friendly for my 11 year old sister who's no clue about computers    and it's good enough for me too  .

if anybody's got a problem then just contact microsoft and see what can be worked out    it really is a good o/s if you have the system requirements minimum , and it's very stable  .

but if it doesn't need fixin , don't touch it    if your'e hapy with 98 etc then do not go to xp unless you think it'd be cool to have a totally working (usually i say  .

) out the box product  .

it's brilliant but expensive  .

i reccomend it if you've a generally good computer and want to go from 98 , or me    xp's the way to go at the mo .

windows xp professional is a good operating system   stable , and makes a 935mhz processor seem like 1  .

6ghz  .

i do not consider myself a power user but this operating system (xp pro) is by far the best foot microsoft has put forward  .

it took some getting used to but plug 'n play is truly that  .

my dell p4    2  .

5 came with it and i have yet to have a single problem  .

it has some sluggishness to it that i have come to expect from ms products but for what i do (cad) it still beats ms 98 hands down  .

windows xp pro is a good reliable up to date os period  .

don't believe the hype , also don't be dicouraged by the people that try to run this software on underpowered systems  .

on a modern computer it works quickly and so far after two months of pretty intense activity crash free  .

i've been running it on a amd 1700+ based system with 256mb of ram  .

not exactly the most powerful or elite system out there  .

it works like a charm  .

yes , it is resource heavy and should not be run on a wimpy processor or upgraded from an upgrade from win 3  .

i gather some people on here just keep adding upgrades to upgrades and behold , it does not work properly  .

well , duh  .

get it on a fresh install , on a machine that can handle it and it works fine  .

it's not going to revolutionize your pc environment or cure cancer  .

it just runs programs and manages files  .

oh wait  .

that's what an operating system is supposed to do .

i cannot speak for users of older pc's but my pc runs xp just great  .

i've not had xp crash although app's crash from time to time  .

overall a great os .

some software may have to be re    installed , but system runs at optimal performance .

i replaced windows 98 with windows xp professional  .

times of systemfailures are over  .

even critical programs are running stable  .

networkadministration is easier than ever .

for an operating system that uses so much system memory , this thing flies  .

and stability , not even one crash , i dual boot with 98se , and to test the stability i use norton systemworks 2001 , installed on 98se , and still did'nt crash , instead does an excellent job with all utilities on both my c and d drive , do not understand why it does'nt crash , because norton 2001 is on the xp incompatible list , works fine for me , does an excellent job of optimizing and defragmenting xp  .

also i have a voodoo 3500 video card , that xp auto installed the drivers for and works perfect , i could'nt even find 98 drivers that really performed well for it  .

and one last thing , it does take 1  .

5 gb to install it , but i also have w2k pro on another dual boot system and with the service packs and updates , it's about the same , but slower , and yes it has crashed .

wow  .

the interface is awesome , and although some things are a couple layers deeper than they were in win 2k , i think it is very easy to use  .

i have been able to get driver upgrades for free for all my third party hardware from the respective companies , and everything works great  .

no crashes either  .

it is far superior to win 98 (what a joke of an os) .

after having put up with multiple blue screens per day , xp professional is a breath of fresh air  .

the hardware support is wonderful , too  .

i did not need to go around digging up driver installation disks or getting drivers off the web xp had it all taken care of , which is nice and convenient  .

xp is much more bloated , but the stability is well    worth the sacrifice .

i got xp pro and the speed is definitely increased by like hundreds of percent , and it only froze on me couple times in one whole year , now thats way better than me , 2000 or nt , cause they all freeze a lot  .

but the pricy tag makes me wonder who else will buy this product when you can download it free from morpheus  .

good reliability and performance , thought it does not support alot of older programs and games  .

i suggest you install windows 98 as a second os because xp will not support everything  .

otherwise , excellent once tweaked to its full potential  .

haggled over whether to install over my win2000 but convinced to do so  .

more flexibility in running new and old software , better multimedia , snazier appearance , and excellent support  .

also seems to manage memory very well .

i purchased a new dell notebook and ordered xp pro on it  .

right out of the box it runs pretty good  .

after tweaking around and setting my personal preferences it runs descent  .

definitely get the on line updates , they help  .

it's a little faster than my windows 2000 machine , but i will rate 2000 as a tad more stable  .

but we are on sp2 with 2000  .

after a sp release for xp it could be as stable as 2000 .

i have just recently installed winxp pro on my home computer  .

since i have installed it there have been no problems with my computer what so ever  .

when i is running win98 i had to install every driver for my perphipals  .

ever since i have installed xp i have not had to look for anything  .

overall my applications are running with little speed increase , but my system never locks up anymore  .

there were a few problems with having to download upgrades or different versions of my applications because some of them did not nessecarly agree with xp  .

other than that i have had no problems  .

it is a great operating system that is one of the most stable from microsoft ever .

realy good work from microsoft this time  .

fast and stable are mainfeatures , i think  .

and with some styles form themexp  .

org , it looks as kde , qnx or even appel's os x  .

realy nice product .

cannot use either of our printers , and may never be able to  .

xp is totally unstable program the more it runs the more errors  .

i am sending in at least 10 auto notifications to ms a day  .

they have to be getting completely snowed , if they are even checking  .

we are taking our system down and installing 98se  .

has difficulty even copying files  .

useless  .

i think this is by far the best windows to date  .

it came with my new system so i cannot speak for upgrading or activation  .

i have not had one single compatibility issue       a few warnings (which i ignored)       and that's it  .

now , i'm no ms lover but i welcome xp with open arms , especially when i think about the 9x/nt series  .

all you haters never liked ms , so this wo not change anything .

the only complaints that people have about this os are ones that they should have been aware of  .

everyone knows about product activation , everyone knows that old hardware probably won't work  .

if you are going to upgrade to a new os , do your research and you won't have problems  .

i wouldn't recommend spending money on xp if you already have win2k , but if you are running 9x , it is definately worth it  .

product activation , although a change , is merely an enforcement of previous policies  .

it is worth it though , it has made my machine (1  .

9 ghz p4 , 1 gb of ram) run so stable , i have left it on for 6 days without a restart , and even then only had to restart for an installation  .

i do not know if the blue screen of death is still blue , because i have yet to have a crash  .

one complaint i read is about opengl  .

as for my experiences , the ati drivers that were included in the xp installation used ms opengl , but that is fixed with drivers downloaded from ati's website  .

i would recommend downloading drivers (if available) ahead of time for video cards and sound cards  .

the firewall that is included is optional and is presented as such when setting up a network connection  .

the look is completely customizable ; there is even a preset theme that rolls back to win98  .

the animations and other navigation enhancements are annoying and hog resources , but they are easily turned off  .

the built in dvd playback is a bit misleading , but is not much of an issue  .

startup time is incredible and the multiple user support is top notch  .

if you are thinking of upgrading , do your homework  .

check all your hardware first and you will have no problems .

i partition my 30 gig hdd and installed win2k and winxp pro in my system  .

both os's are great  .

thank you , mr  .

gates and microsoft  .

you guys know how to make your os  .

i is having major problems with multi    media while using windows 2000  .

since using windows xp the problems have completly dissapeared  .

the system is extremly stable .

xp is running nicely on my machine  .

i have yet to reboot it , even though i've installed many programs and changed network settings twice  .

no crashes at all , 98se would have crashed a couple times by now on this machine  .

all my games run fine , all my hardware is detected and functions great , and the os itself is quite fast  .

activation is nothing , its painless and wont effect hardly any (if any at all) legit users  .

only problem i had is with cd burning  .

but i fired up windows update and let it search my machine to see if there were any updates i needed  .

what did it find  .

a small patch that downloaded and installed itself with just a couple clicks of the mouse and all is well now  .

cd burning works great now  .

i have tried every ms os since dos  .

i've hated the win 9x due to stability  .

finally there is an os with stability and large hardware and software support .

though i like this os , if you have an older machine , i would recommend sticking with what you have  .

i have installed this on 3 machines  .

a vaio pcv    lx900 , which is a fairly new computer , so installation went without a hitch  .

a homebuilt asus p2b    d2 with dual piii500's and 256mb ram    that is a serious pain  .

i actually had to remove all of the partitions on the drive and reformat the entire thing , unplug my second video card , nic , and cd burner , then install and put the stuff back in , then track down drivers (win2k drivers work for most stuff)  .

also installed it on a k6    2 350 homebuilt with 192mb ram    that went fairly well except because that computer has nothing but a monitor plugged into it  .

be sure that your hardware is compatible and try to get ahold of the corporate edition  .

messing with wpa is a real pain .

i've been using xp extensively for about 8 hours a day for 2 months now and it has not crashed yet  .

that's right , not one single forced reboot  .

gone are the 98se days of incessant crashing  .

i used win2k for over a year before upgrading to xp and i can say xp is ever bit as good as win2k's stability and easier to configure  .

i honestly cannot say enough good about this new os  .

kudos to the xp development team for a job well done .

i have only played with xp on a system at best buy and from what i say it looked ok  .

i do agree that the ui is a bit childish but it can all be turned off  .

i have a question for josh m  .

what are you talking about  .

can i even use os x on my pc  .

i have used this for one month now (starting from the betas) and it has not crashed even once  .

exellent stability  .

it runs faster on my system , is more stable on my system , and it even detected some hardware that i couldn't get goin' in 98se or 2k  .

for those more experienced users who know windows and have worked with it in the past , it's simple , fast , pretty , and stable  .

that's all you need from an os , and this is the first time you'll get it from microsoft  .

user friendly without the annoyance (for once  .

just make sure you've got the latest updates for you motherboard  .

in my case , the via 4    in    1 drivers settled a nasty case of events i don't want to see any time soon  .

aside from that i wo not be going back to 98 or 2k again .

like the look of it very much  .

it beats 2000pro hands down , more user friendly with a good new face lift  .

i like it  .

as i read the comments of others users , i notice how most of them are critical of every detail of microsoft's new os  .

it is human nature to be less than perfect  .

no single piece of software can be absolutely inclusive of every aspect people desire  .

if microsoft created the perfect operating system , there would be no need for 3rd party software or technical support  .

instead of criticizing every tiny flaw in the os , take it for what it actually is   a strong step toward a truly enjoyable , and productive operating environment .

it might bring a little color and adventure into our dull lives and for the moment it's a wonderful distraction from the realities  .

i am using it and it does all those things the eminent reviewers and microsoft tout and given time i am sure it will do even more because microsoft are obliged to support it now thats what we are paying for and if you get bored with the color etc reinstall w2k  .

very slow startup , often crashes when shutting down haha what in hell are you talking about you weirdo , it starts up faster than any of the other windows series , and has not even crashed on me once  .

you must be really rubbish at setting up windows boxes .

if your buying an operating system oem disc , forget home edition , get the professional edition , you get more than 3x as much for just paying a little extra .

i used xp home before and i did not see a difference between xp home and pro , until i saw the specifications  .

windows xp professional is way better  .

get professional  .

it's worth the extra 100 dollars .

security issues take all the cons , otherwise perfect featurewise  .

you should definetely get this if your're still using windows 9x , but windows 2000 works fine .

i'm sure windows thinks that xp is for everyone , but unfortunately it's not  .

a lot of complains are that the os is slow , buggy and has many security risk  .

i been running xp before it came out and at first it is slow as hell ; however , after reconfiguring the he  .

out of it , it surpassed my expectations of what i called speed  .

expecting the os to be 100% stable and little to no security brisk is not a microsoft thing  .

if mac or linux for that matter would be more popular then you would also see more security breaches like microsoft  .

in fact , more people are trying linux , usually the mandrake flavor because it's the most user friendly distribution , and you are seeing the same concepts microsoft is using  .

things like error reporting , registering with the mandrake team (which is not required) , full welcome screen , etc  .

as software/operating systems become more popular more breaches come out ; and if you are a mandrake fan youll know what im talking about because not even 2 years there wasnt more then about 6 security problem , yet now there are a lot more then six  .

when i had red hat running , there where 0 virus on linux and now there are how many  .

two or something however , if your upgrading from win 2k , then that would be pointless because it would be like getting a gold zelda edition cartridge for nintendo 64  nothing much change except the color and the final scene actually showed red blood instead of green  instead of the regular grey version .

windows xp pro is very stable if you use only microsoft product and powerful brand name computer  .

it is extreme hardware dependant (clone computers may hang due to cheap ram and motherboard)  .

need at lease 256m ram (best 512m ram)  .

remote desktop is a handy tool for your network administrator to fix computer problem remotely  .

personally do not use upgrade , full fresh install is recommend  .

awesome  .

first , i is using me for several years , and i actually got used to restarting my pc 10 to 20 times every single day  .

(no joke)  .

i is so disgusted i almost bought a mac  .

(whew that is close)  .

once i installed xp pro , all my troubles were gone  .

yeah , my hp scanjet 6200c is now worthless , but that is a small price to pay for an absolutely bulletproof os  .

all those mac switch commercials you see , well all that stuff xp does as well  .

i plugged in my sony digital camera , it recognized it first time and asked me what i wanted to do with the pics  .

when i open any folder that has pics in them , the pics are all displayed as thumb nails and then a slide show starts  .

the most important thing is the fact that this os has never crashed once  .

not even the slightest hickup  .

i have to use act  .

, softplan , fasttrack , word , excel , winfax pro , and other apps all day for work , so i have to stick with ms products for now  .

look , i do not know about much , but i know that this is the best os i have ever seen or used  .

get out of your me world  .

it's not worth it  .

(oh yeah , stop refreshing the apple  .

com ads all day long to see janie porsche spew that propaganda  .

it will will ruin your life) .

just because an os does not run good on ur home made machine w/ bargane basement hardware doesnt mean it does work good .

microsoft's best yet    it can and will crash    it still is not fool proof     .

when i first installed xp , i did it over my me os  .

i had tons of errors and crashes  .

then i reformatted my hard drive and then reinstalled xp , now it works like a charm  .

for better performance   do not stack an os on top of another  .

microsoft' os is geting better and better  .

still has stability problems , almost zero support but the main goods   application's crush make less influence on the system ; the gui (graphics user interface) is excelent ; backword compatibility wizzard ; system restore (works better then windows me) ; small network supported perfectly  .

now tell me    is there any other serious alternative in the pc world  .

an ordinary user (member of users group) may install programs  .

it is possible to restrict capabilities to access windows installer , but how about other kind of programs which does not use windows installer  .

support  .

do not loose your time to contact microsoft if you are using an oem version  .

they will tell to ask for support from yours computer's vendor  .

;    (  .

i upgraded to windows xp becuase my computer came with the possible worst os in history    winme  .

buggy , unstable and all around annoying i decided to get xp so i could actaully get some work done  .

xp is much more stable not letting buggy programs take down the system but instead shutting them down  .

but xp is still annoying  .

the first problem i encountered is with start    up  .

windows just wouldn't start up all my programs even if i specifically told it too  .

it was not picky about what it would take down either  .

first it is norton antivirus 2002 , then ai roboform , and finally weatherbug  .

i don't know how many programs it would have eventually purged from my startup menu if i hadn't noticed it faster  .

when i got that out of the way the next thing i noticed is that the program compatibility mode was not all it is cracked up to be  .

most programs still don't run right or at all no matter which mode you put it in  .

my last gripe is that its internet connection program is very fussy  .

if 2 programs try to dail the same connection xp throws a temper tantrum and exclaims the connecton is already being dailed instead of ignoring one request like previous versions of windows do  .

also if you cancel the connectoin it goes right back and tries to dail it immediately afterward which is a real pain because you can tell it time after time not to but it will still do it if your set to connect automatically  .

but xp still has some bright spots making it a worthwhile upgrade  .

its new interface and set of icons is easy and pleasing to the eyes on the whole  .

also if you've never had nt or 2000 before the nfts file system is better than its fat32 cousin  .

and the best of all for me is that it makes my modem goes an astonishing 5k faster and my graphics card has never worked better delivering better graphics than it ever has  .

bottom line   if your happy with your current version of windows don't bother because its a serious undertaking to upgrade with many possible problems ; if you are not get xp .

i have used every ms release from dos and win 3  .

x to me , 2000 , and now xp  .

some may view that as sacrilidge , but when it comes to the incredible number of win32 programs out in the computer world , most people are forced to use a windows product (even if as a secondary choice in a dual    boot system)  .

xp is by far the best product that microsoft has released  .

taking the stable nt kernel and mixing it with the multimedia of the 9x line has actually produced a great result  .

xp pro is stable , fully customizable , and has increased ease of dealing with certain file type by integrating menus into the window you are viewing based on the majority of files in that window  .

hopefully that is not too confusing  .

as an example , if you have multiple pictures in a folder , you have the option to print any combination of those out at any combination of different sizes  .

while their are many ease pluses added to the os , they also add a minuses  .

in making it easier in certain regards , they have made it much harder to get to the deep administrative and foundation controls of the os  .

digging through menus and options is not fun  .

also , the remote assistance option which is supposed to be a god send to computer illiterates is a huge security gap  .

how could ms engineers not see this  .

the raw ports that this os leaves open is also a security gap when on the internet (although i believe some of these issues have been addressed in updates i highly recommend a firewall    and not the one built into xp)  .

nevertheless , the stability of this os makes up for most problems experienced  .

another complaint is the high requirements for the os  .

minimum requirements or even recommended requirements for this os are not enough  .

you need at least 256 mb of ram and around a 700 mhz processor , and that is if you have the os running cleanly  .

this is definitely a bloated code os  .

despite all that , if you can deal with the difficulty of trying to customize and the high system requirements (and you are not totally against all things microsoft) , this is a great os to have .

winxp os , has been very entertianihg  .

i really appreciate the winxp nightmares hepl tips  .

but i've been able to locate drivers and not have to exchange or replace amy hardware and my pc's 2  .

5yrs old  .

i'm not even a software (hardware smart guy  .

but i have worked with win95 , 987 , me (win9x)on personal pc  .

winxp your o  .

once you learn it's differences from the earlier msoft windows versions , it is a breeze  .

however it does not network well with 98 , but that seems to be it's only real downfall , except for all the idiots that buy the upgrade and wonder why it crashes daily  .

wipe your system and buy the full version  .

this is the ultimate os  .

the only flaw is that it dosenot support many applications  .

so if u are found of some old applications dont go for this one .

i just install window xp and by far the best os out to date and i been useing win 95'98 linux mac os's as well found all of my hardware and here a plus no games have freeze up on me  .

when i is useing win 98 freeze all the time and i have a 3 d card by far the best os .

yes there are problems with some 'no name' hardware drivers  .

although i've installed win98 and win2k drivers on all my no name parts that didn't support xp , and they ran just fine  .

anyone who complains about xp being unstable just doesn't know what the hell that are doing  .

this o/s requires tweaking , as does any other machine  .

do not expect it to run perfect after a format and freash install with box drivers  .

download those updates  .

this o/s also is good for a poweruser , or home soccer mom that wants to check e    mail  .

just tweak it out however you like  .

although make sure you've got a suitable machine to run the 'flashy' gui .

xp is faster and more stable than win 98se  .

boot times surpass 98 by a long shot  .

for someone thinking about buying xp i recommend going with xp pro  .

because you do not have to unlock the pro version  .

also check all of your hardware and make sure it is supported under xp before upgrading  .

then after you upgrade i highly recommend plus for xp and search around for websites that will show you how to tweak and personalize your new os .

no operating system's perfect but windows xp professional is the closest i've seen any come close to  .

i think this is the best operating system microsoft has come out with since 98se  .

it has the stability of 2000 , the compatibility of win 9x (to some extent) , and a cool new interface  .

i didn't have to do activation b/c i have the 64 bit version so i cannot tell you anything about the process  .

i sometimes i hear it's painless sometimes i hear otherwise  .

most people complain that it's hard to use third party software for cd burning and stuff like that but it's good that it comes with that support right out the box  .

if you do not like the interface or you want the computer to move a little faster , you can switch it to classic mode  .

just remember if your hardware has no drivers for windows xp , try those for 2000 not 9x  .

also , like anything from microsoft , it's better to do a clean install instead of upgrading  .

that seems to be alot of people's problem .

it forces you to register and moreover there are not so many new things about xp  .

the only thing that's really different is the look  .

the interface is great to work with compared to previously  .

especially like the enhanced start menu and taskbar  .

very fast for loading prgrams and very few incompatability problems  .

has never crashed for me yet  .

do not like some of the features like product activation and passport integration and would prefer it if the price is a lot cheaper than it is now .

i found windows xp to be much faster than my previous os (windows me) , i like the cleaner graphics windows has now , and best of all , it has not crashed once  .

it's been working beutifully and perfectly ever since i installed it (i did a clean install since people told me its better)  .

oh yeah , it recognized and installed drivers for all my hardware except for my printer , but i found the xp drivers for my printer on the epsons web site , so no prob  .

since i haven't had any problems , i haven't needed support , so i did not know how i should rate the support category .

only problem i have is the lack of support for visioneer one touch scanner visioneer wo not give us drivers for 2000 , let alone xp and i doubt ms will work on it sigh  .

one user , per system that is the worst idea ever  .

who cares what features it has if you can not use it on more than one system .

i've gone from win 98 to xppro and the difference is amazing  .

performance and features in a stable os  .

minor problems setting up but once the right drivers were installed it just wo not crash .

well its the best os ive used (from microsoft) i myself being a bsd user basicly would say xp sucks , as it takes lots of power and realy isnt stable if you compare it to other operating systems , but if i look at this from a windows type user view , then its a good os and should be bought to run on your computer (s) .

windows xp from first glance is worth your time and money  .

it has the stability of windows 2000 with the user interactivity and speed of me .

i think this version of windows is a little too gui  .

it's just unneccessary to have all of the fancy effects that they stuffed into this thing  .

a fresh install on a bare hard drive is going to take up over a gigabyte of space  .

granted , what ms has done is installed all the drivers for practically every device out there onto your hard drive , so if you happen to plug in a firewire camera , for example , the drivers install from your hard drive , no cd required  .

for the most part , you only have to make sure that you connected the device correctly , because windows xp takes care of the rest  .

this is a nice change from the old windows 95 experience of being screwed if you lost the driver disk for that 33  .

6 cirrus logic modem whose drivers can not be found online  .

my favorite feature of windows xp is the little genuine product sticker that changes colors when you rub it with your finger  .

i'm kidding  .

really , though , the nicest feature of windows xp is the amazingly improved ability to detect devices and properly install them almost completely unaided  .

it's definetely going to male owning a computer easier for people who have never had one before , or who are too impatient to learn how to install hardware themselves .

at last microsoft get it right  .

after installing and getting over a few teething problems such as re    installing zone alarm and dsl drivers everything runs smoother and much faster  .

my pc has not crashed once as yet and ive been putting it through its paces  .

well worth going for  .

i have two computers they are up graded qite often  .

so every time i changed some components i have to reactivate  .

this is a hobby , so i'm not going to pay $300  .

00 for each computer operating system .

over all good performance , approx  .

all utilities includes in this window , such as fax , msn  .

ineternet explorer etc  .

windows xp is probably microsoft's flagship os , which will be used to compare all future os  .

it is stable and better and millennium edition and vista  .

the bsod and poor memory management were my two issues with vista .

installed the upgrade on my piii thank goodness i backed up my harddrive  .

i got a blue screen before the xp completed loading  .

so once i reformatted my harddrive and reloaded the os it has worked fine  .

xp does have a problem with norton systemworks 2000  .

i had to download an updated patch to allow it to work  .

after that everything is working well  .

xp is a good os not great yet  .

it does run well once all your compatiability issues are addressed  .

very solid like win2k  .

i think it will get better as it continues to evolve .

i got a copy of xp when it is released  .

mine , at least , crashed without dumping phyical memory , a bad crash wrecked the system files nessessitating complete reinstall because , unlike 2k it cannot be reinstalled in repair mode  .

after four such reinstalls , i gave the thing away as a bad joke  .

2k still has a lot more going for it  .

i did upgrade to service pack 1  .

the same thing happened  .

i have had no such problems with 2k , maybe i have a bad copy , or maybe the system is still not ready for serious work  .

note   not being able the restore the system by reinstalling in repair mode is a powerful disencentive  .

i have better things to do with my time than to be reinstalling everything unnessarily .

win xp has numerous features , is more stable than win2k (let alone win98 ) , has a nicer gui , more intuitive gui , et cetera , et cetera , but i strongly disapprove of microsoft's product activation scheme to the point i must give it a thumbs down  .

they claim it's to prevent piracy  .

well , a hardware security key placed on the computer's printer port would resolve that problem easily enough  .

other companies have been doing that for over a decade to protect their software  .

microsoft could have done the same as such security keys are reliable , and the printer port is a universal standard  .

so why does microsoft prefer this intrusive , time consuming , ill    conceived idea of copy protection  .

i've noticed they make it look as if you have to register the product in order to activate it  .

perhaps their game is getting more people to register  .

i'm not sure  .

but from a different point of view , this is a form of communism  .

corporate communism , and don't expect it to go away any time soon  .

i had thought of upgrading to office xp and frontpage 2002  .

i'm not so sure now  .

i do not feel i should support a company that treats its consumers like dirt  .

( plus  .

xp proves how they feel about their customers )  .

not much better than 2000  .

but turn off the fisher price interface and it works fine .

much less glitchy than me  .

far more stable after wakeup than any previous version of windows .

windows xp (ou nt 5  .

1) est une bonne ï¿½volution de windows nt  .

enfin beau et stable  .

a part quelque incompatibilitï¿½ de drivers , que du bon a ne pas mettre entre toutes les mains quand mï¿½me  .

xp is a little to user friendly for me i do not like all thouse error sending messages , if you are typing ao fast and then you pause (to think about howie long or something) your whole key board is locked into some special key codes basically , you have to re    boot  .

overall , it is good , but when we were used to the days where we did d  base , dos prompts xp is really easy , a no brainer , just a little too user friendly .

i can push at win2k all day and night and not experience a single problem wish i could say the same for windows xp  .

i've experienced driver_irql_not_less_or_equal errors with xp in one week than i have with win2k in 6 months , and my win2k os has not given me an error in at least 3 of those 6  .

xp gets way too out of shape on one machine while working fine on another , even though the 2 machines can be simliar and this implies to me that its a steaming pile as the same machines can run windows98/me/win2k and linux just fine .

i run a 1  .

2 ghz athlon at home with 384 mb of ddr memory  .

after switching to xp , it seemed like loading times were not any greater than me  .

it almost seemed like xp is too much  .

i did like the login screen feature and felt it is more a pain than anything else  .

it is also very hard to find specific drivers , almost impossible and many games were not compatible with it  .

i re    installed win me with cachman (a must) and tweaked the virtual memory settings and my system is running great once again (without xp) .

ai jumpped on the bandwaggon with most others , purchasing the mosr relible os microsoft has produced  .

shortly after installing it i kept recieving numerous errors , everytime seding an error report to microsoft  .

i still have yet to under stand what the reports did , because i never ever got a responce  .

to top everything , the product activation never fully installed (either of the 3 times i installed xp to my pc) causing me to never be abel to activate it  .

after writing microsoft and gettig no responce , the activation period is up , since i did't uninstall it (thinking that this great system which is very fast and user freindly , would be fixed by microsoft)  .

thus i had to restore my pc , loosing all of my programs and files i have ever had on my computer  .

well nedless to say , i will not be getting xp untill it has been out on the market for more than a year , hopefully microsoft will fix all the bugs for a more reliable system  .

the speed and capabilities are excellent , the system is jsut too full of buggs  .

i have a quad boot machine with 95 , 98 , w2k and xp home  .

the stability of the system is fine  .

i have had no problems  .

as for the error reporting , i think it is a decent thing for the corporation to provide , it speaks of the functionality of various drivers  .

case in point , my visioneer usb works about half of the time and my norton utilities do not work , even though they're 2002  .

but you know what  .

windows xp does provide stability for the quad boot and does not steal drivers and kernels from other os's , allowing me to boot into any os i want , all day long  .

everything is compartmentalized and speedy , and microsoft has always done well to provide service packs and updates based on the info reported via the error reporting tool  .

for free  .

they could charge you (w98 se)  .

relax , be patient and remeber that if you are complaining , then you are an amateur and only bought it because it would be cool to own the latest without regard to intelligence .

i like the new look and feel of xp , but would argue with anyone who says its more stable than 2k  .

i ran 2k from the day it came out until about a week ago without any problem but since i always upgrade to the latest and greatest i tried xp  .

install is easy , with only one expected error (isa nic card in legacy mode) which is easily fixable  .

the activation contraversy about giving away your privacy is a joke       there are countless resources on the web explaining exactly what supposed personal information you are sending to big brother  .

aside from using basic hardware configuration to generate a code that from what i understand is not even unique to your machine , no other info is used  .

i haven't used tech support yet , but from other people's posts it does not sound cheap  .

regardless of the hype , xp is exactly what i expected it to be       win 2k for the home user  .

oh , and the remote desktop is fun to play with .

microsoft is successful in developing an os that united stability and performance  .

although it will never be the same as , windows xp looks more like linux in these aspects than any other windows versions (except maybe for win2k)  .

the built    in explorer version even looks like linux's conqueror browser no credits paid for the stolen idea though , a la microsoft's style however , its hardware support stinks  .

for example , if you have a sound blaster live  .

you're going to go through a lot of pain to get it working       not excluding the bunch of generic drivers that are assigned to a great part of the system  .

you also should not be fooled by the cd    burning support    it's not that good either , meaning that you still will probably need to have a cd    burning program  .

as another reviewer pointed out , it is a great system if you have the supported hardware  .

if you do not , that sucks .

as soon as i can play dvd's again , and hear sound come out of my speakers , i'll give it thumbs up  .

i've experienced problems with software and hardware , all told to me in advance  .

the dvd issue stated that pc    dvd would have to be reinstalled after the upgrade , and even after doing so , did not work for me  .

when i get fed    up , i'll try a clean install , i guess .

despite the tiny pretty interface i would not consider to use xp around  .

i am running a system with 256 mb ram and 1ghz processor  .

i find my system faster with windows 2000 pro  .

you have to turn off all animations and that kind of features on xp if you want to have your system working at the normal speed  .

only consider xp if you are buying at least a 1  .

5 ghz system with 512 mb ram  .

there are not enough compatible software around yet and with the raw sockets you are allowing spyware to make any spoofed ddos attack .

i've been using the new os for about 4 days now and initially i is not very happy with it  .

i find that the added interface is all eye candy and doesn't increase productivity at all  .

it doesn't slow it down any though  .

that is why i deam this version xtra pretty  .

as far as an upgrade goes though , if you have windows me definitly upgrade  .

if you have windows 98 se and have it working the way you want , it probably wo not be worth it  .

i is reading all the benchmark testing on it from zdnet , and i cannot say that it feels 56% faster then windows me (what i is running prior to the upgrade)  .

internet explore 6 still crashes frequenlty  .

some of my programs required reinstall (i stuck with the fat32 file system but i may decide to go to the ntfs)  .

thats all  .

for anyone who has been using windows2000 , winxp is a mere cosmetic facelift  .

i don't think users will really gain anythings substantial from this release  .

get real  .

you guys pro this version  .

microsoft want a 200 bucks for something like this and restrict user of flexible installation on their machine  .

it sucks  .

where are the innovations  .

i do not see any  .

better go to linux  .

stability and durability 3  .

ease of use 3  .

speed 4  .

features 2  .

looks 2  .

i am really disappointed in a company that makes it's users wait five years for a new operating system only for it to be crappy and force the users who are to stubborn to try any alternative os's into using xp  .

xp in my opinion is old and out dated  .

we should not even be talking about xp on c    net any more than we should be talking about mac os x jaguar .

it isnt worth buying  .

i know i know , you have seen lots of thumbs up for this thing don  .

t listen to them  .

i don  .

t know which xp are they talking about , since this is the most unstable os ever  .

in both versions it crashes all the time and has serius compatibility issues , most old aplications won  .

t work right on it , hell  .

even the ones designed for xp wont work properly  .

it looks great and is very user friendly but you are not going to care much about that when you find yourself unable to use most of your programs without crashing or having to quit because there  .

s a problem with the system  .

you may try updating all your drivers and every updatable thing in your computer , you can try to configure everything by yourself , it still wont work , as a mather of fact unless you are one of the xp programing team i doubt you are going to be able to customize it right  .

to make the long story short , maybe in the future it will work fine (with 1 or 2 gb of critical updates) , in the meantime i recomend you to save your money and try this one later (in 2 years or so) .

i totally booped on this one  .

got the xp pro and regret it ever since  .

lots of games and hardware say they work on xp and they really do not even with uprades and using the compat wiz  .

sure the skin looks nice and techie , but guess what  .

my 98se cd is going back on the hd after i get xp off of it  .

this os sometimes has a mind of its own , unlike 98se and previous where you can control what your sys is doing and what you would like it to do  .

i want my pc to do things my way , not what ms wants it to do  .

wonder how much i would get for my cd if i sold it on ebay .

if you own a digital camera or have previous versions of non    windows applications , they do not work  .

they are non compatible .

it's the most crash prone program i have ever owned  .

it crashes while on the internet  .

it crashes while working  .

it crashes between the time you walk away from the computer and when you return to it  .

it really sucks  .

the only program that is stable is the email .

i get the same @#$%^  .

error message as user dean (14 apr 2002 driver_irql_not_less_or_equal with random crashes accompanied by a dreaded blue screen  .

this is driving me crazy and did not know what to suspect until i saw someone in a similar situation  .

i hope microsoft get thier act together and improve on xp  .

it's totally unacceptable for a os that costs that much to be so unstable  .

installs on only one pc i own six pc's , buy it for all  .

no way in hell  .

it would have to be really good and it's not  .

waste of money  .

i have recently built a new machine p4 1  .

9ghz 400mhz fsb 512mb of rdram ata 100 drives etc , etc  .

i figured since i am going to build a kickin machine i would use ms latest to get the most my new box has to offer  .

comparing this machine to my other win box this upgrade does not seem that much faster compared to my older p3 800 133mhz fsb 256mg ram  .

however i must admit all the new hardware installed without a hitch except for the creative audigy sound card which just needed the drives for xp which you can get at soundblasters web site  .

all my applications worked from quickbooks to photoshop , all macromedia products over to madden 2002  .

the only app that i had a problem with is a vpn package i use for work  .

if you are using roxio ez cd cdreator 5 you need to get a patch from their web site no problems  .

for all of you worried about you privacy and giving micro$oft you info when activating you product use the phone method  .

all the yask for is the key number that is generated and they give you a key back  .

however what i do not like about this process , is that i is told without a major overhaul ( hardware wise ) i should not have to get a new activation key if i do a reinstall  .

well when i first installed , i is building the box to test software to see what works and what do not on the the second install i is asked for the ativation key i entered the one i is given previously and it did not work  .

the only thing that i could see effecting this would be my hard drive is partitioned so i could install linux on this box as well  .

for you who do not like the look and feel you can change most things to have the windows classic look  .

one big + when changing network info no more reboots  .

but adding some packages still need a reboot to take affect  .

ms still needs to figure out the conscept of a dynamic kernel  .

i do find that the os is a little slower mostly when working with images , i thought this is supposed to be an os geared towards multimedia  .

xp came installed on my laptop and i notices the slowness as well , believe me i much rather have 98 on my laptop  .

i am currently looking for some documentation on xp perf tuning hopefuly i can get this configered better  .

probablly a lot of uselles junk running in the background  .

my recommendation would be to upgrade but wait until the infamous second release that always seems to appear shortly after you upgrade  .

also this gives time for all the other vendors to get caught up and have the software and drivers ready for xp .
