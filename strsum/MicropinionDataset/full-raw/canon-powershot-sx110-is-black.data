overall , best buy for size and features  .
add chdk (canon hack developers kit) for additional features like live histogram , zebra mode , raw capabilities , and more  .
i kind of wish it had the option for a neck strap , but it might be too small for that .
bottom    line this camera will do all u want it 2 and more its worth the money easy to use point and shoot just buy a couple extra one or 2 gb cards offf ebay is the cheapest place stick with name brand though less hassles you wont regret it  .
great camera even for the price  .
it is well worth it  .
i still am amazed at how clar the pictures are even traveling at 50mph the pictures are as if the subject is standing still  .
i don't find it bulky as the guy stated in the review  .
i do not notice anything sluggish  .
the only thing this camera is missing a touch screen but who needs that  .
the videos are crystal clear , and although the person reviewed it did state you cannot zoom , i did but this is not a movie camera  .
the features are very easy to learn overall i would highly recommend this camera for picture quality  .
i've had this camera for about four months now an it's amazing  .
i wanted a dslr but couldn't afford one so i bought this instead  .
i is not disappointed  .
this camera gives you full control of everything including aperture , shutter speed , iso , white balance , and flash output  .
for $220 , the camera feels like it's relly worth $600  .
the zoom on the camera is just enough to get amazing far away shots , but also compact enough to still fit in your pocket  .
camera is heavier then other point and shoots , but feels more well built than heavy  .
i guarantee that you will not be disappointing if you buy one of these  .
i won't be upgrading cameras for a long time could not fit this in the pros section  .
10x zoom lens is awesome for getting those far away shots  .
still fits in your pocket  .
when you change modes with the wheel on the top of the camera , you see the wheel on screen so you can change modes at night  .
if you  .
with that said , there are a couple of things you should know when un    boxing the system  .
first of all , the measly 32mb memory card you receive is just about worthless  .
plan on purchasing a 8gb card  .
they can be had for about $15 and if you take many photos or any videos you will be glad you did also , my camera's video setting came out of the box in the compact mode , which in my option produces unusable video  .
change it to the standard video/640 30fps (page 89 in the user guide)  .
while this still will not provide you with hd video , it is acceptable for causal shooting  .
however , the included 32mb memory card will only hold about 15 seconds of video at this setting now for the important part  .
for the price point , this camera would be extremely hard to beat  .
the features are numerous and quite amazing  .
i took a picture of an object so far away i could hardly make it out , at full optical and digital zoom and the results were unbelievable  .
however , i must say i did enhance the photo a bit in photoshop  .
you could probably do the same in just about any photo software program , even the one that comes with the camera i cannot say i found any cons with this camera  .
since i take causal and semi    professional photographs in my web designing business , i wanted a camera that is compact yet provided excellent results  .
if i was not concern with the size , i would have likely purchased a sx10 is or xs1 is , but for what i need the sx110 is is more than adequate however , as others have mentioned the camera does eat a steady supply of batteries  .
either buy your aas in bulk or goes the rechargeable route  .
i did not call the camera's energy requirement a con , because i like the big , bright and beautiful lcd and other power hungry features  .
for me , it is a reasonable tradeoff i would highly recommend this camera and i wish you happy shooting  .
i will start with the bottom    line this is one excellent camera  .

the batterys (you have to use high power rechargeable 2500 to 2900 nah  .
batterys or energizer lithium batterys  .
) i have the sx 100 also , and using these i have no battery problems  .
also when possible turn down the brightness controll on lcd  .
pictures are very good but do not use the auto iso shift it just throughs you up into the high isos and will make picyures grainy  .
allso remember to hold the shutter button halfway down and give the camera a sec  .
to focas , make sure image stabilzer is set to continuous or shoot only mode , i use continuous use a good high speed sd card 2 or 4 gig and rember to format it  .
i just use auto 95% of the time  .
i hope this will be helpfull .
i think this is the best value for the cash investment  .
it is a superior to its peers by other manufacturers  .
get a good tripod for long exposures .
for simple point shoot pictures with nice focus , color and details , this is a great camera  .
it also has a 10x optical zoom which is pretty good given that it's not a big camera  .
it's medium size  .
the only things i would do to make this camera better would be to correct the slightly audible swishing sound noise in video mode , make it hd 720 resolution for video , and make the wide angle in photo mode a little more wide angle , sacrificing some zoom ability if necessary  .
8x optical would be enough if it could get just a little wider  .
there are a lot of good small cameras out there so shop around  .
i also like the sonys with car zeiss lens , but for the money you cannot go wrong with this one if you get it for $200 as i did (on sale) .
this is my first digital camera after over 20 years of film slrs  .
i have a very limited budge and wanted to get back into photography after not doing it for a few years  .
i really like this camera now , i will say that i am a person who will read a manual to learn how to use a camera i use the maximum resolution to compensate for the limited zoom (about 360mm equivalent) and get great shots i do not use the software included with the camera  .
i just plug the memory card into my laptop and drag the images to my hard drive  .
then , i use paint  .
net to adjust and crop my pics i have used the aperture adjustment for winter/snow shots with good success i have used the light adjustment for indoor/outdoor light with good success  .
the sunny day setting has given me good results , too  .
i is trying to figure out how to hold a polarizing filter in front of the camera , but the sunny setting works very well i have used the variety of focus modes    including the spot setting for birds i set the iso setting to auto and it works well as i previously mentioned , it is slow between shots  .
i turned off the screen on the back so it does not come on after every shot  .
this saves a little bit of time between shots  .
it is easy to turn on and see your shot by pressing one button  .
and , it is easy to scroll through your pics  .
you can also set up folders on the camera to organize your images this camera uses up batteries relatively quickly  .
however , i use duracell rechargeable batteries with the 10    minute charger and they work great  .
it uses 2 aa size  .
i have 4 batteries    2 in the camera and i carry 2 the movie/video function is limited , but nice to have  .
this is an image camera , not a video camera  .
but , it is still fun to use once in awhile  .
(just do not put your finger over the microphone  .
lol)  .
i hope i can eventually afford another slr camera  .
i still have the lenses from my old elan 7  .
but , this camera is great to have and fun to use i use this case logic catch    all (anc    5 ) for a carrying case    .

the plastic ring slips out of it and the camera fits snugly into it and , there is a hole in the neoprene cover to slip the camera wrist strap through .
this is simply the friendliest camera i've ever owned and i've owned a lot of them .
best still camera i have owned  .
the interface is easy to use , manual controls work well , and overall a good buy  .
it feels like a mini slr camera  .
uses quite a bit of power  .
the grip is a little slippery , but they give you a wrist wrap  .
the video quality is okay , for youtube , but its nothing you want to hook up to your tv since there is no optical zoom  .
i like it more than my nikon d40 , possibly because of the gigantic 3 screen and the top notch photo quality (even though the d40 is suited for entry level pro)  .
i is always used to the zoom being adjusted on the lens , rather than a lever , but that is probably not a problem for most  .
if you do not care so much about the black , professional , slr looks , then you should look at the sx200 , which gives better video (720p hd) and a bit better zoom (12x vs  .
i bought this camera specifically for the zoom and i am not disappointed  .
like all my canon cameras , the photo quality is excellent .
great value ; outstanding quality  .
lots of settings that let me get good photos under tricky circumstances  .
the photos , so far , are amazingly good , indoor or outdoor  .
the auto setting suffices 75% of the time  .
i would recommend sitting down and reading the manual for the other settings , particularly if you're not a photography jock  .
i got a great price from j r , and amazon's been selling it cheap , too       shop around .
i is looking for something to take over from my trusty old nikon af600 (yes , a film camera  .
) and i did not like the current rash of point and shoot trinkets  .
i wanted something i could learn to use    to become a better picture taker  .
i think i found it with the sx110 is .
this camera cost a bit more then most but its well worth the price , i would but this camera agian , it has yet so dissapoint me , i even tapped a basketball game with it without any issuesi love it  .
for the price it is perfect combination of powerful zoom and compact size  .
it fits in the belt camera pouch  .
it works on just 2 aa rechargeable batteries (other cameras with similar zoom require 4 batterries which adds bulk to he camera)  .
highly recommend for the people looking for good optical zoom with that size .
it does everything i want it to do and more .
this is the camera i will take with me , if i want to travel without the full pack of my slr setup  .
the pictures i have taking is loaded up on flickr  .
com , under the canon powershot sx110 is , seattle .
i purchased this camera to replace my s2  .
it's much more compact and uses only 2 batteries , so it is lighter  .
the video capabilities are not even comparable  .
do not purchase this camera if you plan to use it for video at all    only the digital zoom works in video mode and the video is very grainy it's useless  .
using only 2 batteries is great , but they do not last very long  .
when shooting photos that require the use of the flash , the camera takes several seconds to charge the flash  .
the screen goes black while the flash is recharging and it does not have a viewfinder , so you just have to sit and stare a a black screen you cannot try to set up your next shot it's very frustrating  .
i decided to return this camera and go to the sx10 instead it's bulkier and uses 4 batteries , but it is a much better choice for someone who wants a good optical zoom , uses the video capabilities and takes pictures which require the use of the flash .
this camera has a lot of great features a great zoom , but i am almost always disappointed in the picture quality  .
i would expect a 9mp camera to be much better than this  .
i take a lot of photos , and when this is my only camera , i found myself take a lot less photos because i is very disappointed in the photo quality  .
my dad swears by canon , but i think this may be their lemon  .
i did manage to get a few great shots with this camera , but most were dark , grainy or poorly focused  .
my less expensive olympus is much better .
i have mixed feelings it does take good pictures , but it needs to be fixed right the first time .
now google the product    you cannot swing a dead cat without seeing that canon should've pulled this from the shelves and fixed this problem i've had to send this to the factory twice    canon never acknowledged that any specific battery needed to be used or there is a widespread issue  .
first recommendation is use a pencil eraser to clean the battery power connectors , otherwise send it in  .
rec'd it back with a note tested , fixed  .
put generic 2500 nah aa batteries in , powered for 3 seconds and died  .
sent back for a 2nd service  .
meanwhile canon service continued to play blind , deaf and dumb to the obvious issue  .
i just received a phone call from a canon service rep (no return # provided  .
) which simply pointed out that the camera will only work with canon nickel batteries       ahem       so why was not this disclosure made at the point of purchase , why would canon sell the product with this design limitation in the first place , and why when sent for service , did they provide this discovery so late in the process  .
canon lost a canon customer .
this camera belonged to my son and he stopped using it , but now he's happy to get it back with this trick to allow it to turn on  .
there is a design flaw in the battery    level sensing circuit or control logic or software , so i do not recommend buying this model , though i generally like the camera , especially the 10x optical zoom lens and manual modes .
shameful product if you can call it a product  .
for god's sake , cannon  .
employ a photographer to test your product before you mass    produce it in the thousands  .
produce beta versions and not sell them to customers to test at my and others' expense  .
