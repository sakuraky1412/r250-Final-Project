Keyboard feels funny at first, but you get used to it .
I like the keyboard, I like the speakers .
The only comparable keyboards I found were those on much larger laptops .
Small keyboard with some double, function keys
Keyboard is not as sturdy as I would like has some minor flex
Excellent keyboard for typing .
,  keyboard feels well laid out
The keyboard, more than 90% standard size, is just large enough .
Has a very long battery life, runs videos and multimedia smoothly without issues, fast loading, very usable keyboard, stylish sleek design, decent pricing for what you get
My keyboard also seems a bit noisy .
