best mp3 player i have ever gotten .

the main thing that made me get this is the stereo bluetooth  .

the fact that everything i use day to day has bluetooth (i  .

my phone , laptop , desktop , home stereo , portable stereo and headphones/headset) so it just allowed more flexibility of use then any other mp3 player on the market  .

when im on the go i can put on a song , or when im at home tune into the local radio , even can watch a movie in the middle of a boring lecture  .

another factor i loved is the ability to awnser phone calls that are coming though my phone (although the update is coming in december i believe)  .

my friends who own the iphone and/or ipod touch when i connected it to my stereo back at my place were astounded with the audio quality and the bluetooth factor  .

and said if they known the p2 exsisted they would have bough that over any ipod or similar competitors  .

although eveything good has their flaws , my music library is about 6k sougs so i is only able to put a fraction of them on but thats fine i dont really need to listen to all 6k of them in one go  .

also something like a dock would be nice like the ipod has or the zune but its not a must eather so im fine with it  .

over all great player with out the wires .

i currently have a 2gb samsung t9 which is on the same track as this one , but i would really like a device with a touch screen like my pda and bluetooth support  .

i have always wanted to listen to my music with no wires attatched , i literally like everything about it  .

i think it is a really cool device  .

it rocks  .

i own the 16gb version of the yp    p2 , which is the 7th mp3 player i own (none of them ipods) and the second samsung mp3 player  .

after reading many reviews , i opted to purchase this player over the ipod touch based on the reviews from true audiophiles and my own experience with the samsung yp    t9j for starters , those looking to purchase an ipod touch alternative will be disappointed  .

this player is meant for the consumer looking to enhance their music listening experience and video viewing  .

the yp    p2 is a great example of product design with its thin metal body  .

with two buttons on either side that almost seem camoflauged with the black model , the unit is slick and streamlined  .

in my review , i will just speak of the features i use on a day    to    day basis  .

i find that as great as an ipod touch is , i grow tired of the applications quickly and find that i just want to listen to music or watch a movie  .

as for games , i am a little too old for handheld gaming , owning a ps3 and the games that come with the yp    p2 are just a mere distraction that would not be missed if omitted from the player altogether video  .

the video screen is bright and crisp and when watching movies on it , seems like you are watching a mini samsung lcd tv  .

i should know because i also own a samsung lcd tv  .

although loading a movie with the emodio software can be difficult to do without some practice , once one masters the process , the output is worth it  .

i have been able to load three movies onto the player and they all play flawlessly audio  .

this unit clearly is far superior in sound quality to the ipod touch and most other mp3 players with the exception of the newer sony players (i own one sony mp3 player)  .

the dnse equalizer that it comes with allows you to have up three customized settings as well as many of the preset standards that allows for great sound output  .

for the person who is serious about their sound and only uploads high quality mp3 songs from purchased cds and/or legitimate online mp3 services , this player will definitely do justice to those songs  .

although i love the headphones that come with samsung mp3 players , i is fortunate to receive a pair of bose in    ear headphones as a gift and now only carry the samsung ones as a spare pair  .

if you want to enhance your listening experience with the yp    p2 , i recommend in investing in a high    end pair of headphones the volume can be controlled by scrolling your fingers on the right side of the touch screen or the right buttons on the side and this unit can pump out the volume radio  .

for me , a player without a built    in transmitter is not a true mp3 player  .

i only own one player that doesn't have that feature and i only use it for my jogging because i hate switching stations while i run  .

the fm radio that comes with the yp    p2 delivers great sound and great reception  .

however , i cannot understand the need for 30 presets when any major city i have visited usually has 10    15 stations to access and listen to  .

if ne travels frequently and wants to keep their original 'home' presets , the extra stationjs would come in handy  .

the unit allows you also to record directly from the radio into an mp3 format for those who utilize this feature bluetooth  .

i love this feature and have utilized this on a daily basis  .

my cell phone has bluetooth and the great thing about the yp    p2 is that once i linked my phone with the player , i is able to answer any incoming phone calls during my work day at my desk , leaving my phone in my jacket  .

an incoming call would stop any song you are listening to and gie you the option to answer the call , using your headphones to listen and the built    in microphone to talk  .

mind you , you have to place the player close to your mouth  .

yes , their are phones that act as mp3 players as well and have the same feature  .

i know that my phone does not deliver the same sound quality that the yp    p2 player does and my headphones are not compatible with it  .

beside the phone feature , file transfer is a breeze with other bluetooth devices photos  .

as a photoviewer , the yp    p2 is great to display photos  .

it allows you to configure the background with personal photos  .

as an amateur photographer and 3d modeler/animator , the yp    p2 is great for interviews with clients to show my work without having to lug around a laptop or paper portfoilio conclusion  .

although the yp    p2 has its flaws , most players do , including the ipod touch  .

if you are seeking a player for the sheer enjoyment of music and movies , than i would strongly recommend the samsung yp    p2  .

you will not be disappointed and will definitely be the envy of your friends once you allow them to test your player  .

once you realize how great it sounds and look , you will want to invest in some high    end headphones .

this is a great mp3 player with video , with a fm player and is blue tooth compatible .

this is an excellent player , tons of features , very good comunity support on forums and blogs but its emodio software is mediocre .

a great mp3 player , it would be a good touch substitute  .

the screen isnt so great but except that everything else is pretty good  .

i love this player  .

i bought a 8gb when it first came out here in canada at a premium but returned it because it didn't live up to the hyper originally  .

i turned around and got a ipod touch 8gb instead it's been 10 months and i have decided to give the p2 another chance since we are on v5  .

02 now for firmware , and i really miss the audio quality so cons first the screen scratches very easily , and the included screen protector is well pretty cruddy  .

so i took some 3m film and put that over pretty quick because i am ocd with finger prints (i constantly take a microfiber cloth to my devices) i don't remember the back of the player being a matt finish , but i really like it because it does not scratch as easily as the rest of the player , but if your fiddiling with the player during a jog , bike ride , or a generaly warm day , prints show up very easily (but i guess thats a given)  .

the player itself (firmware 5  .

02 is installed) is quite quick to get around , the menu system is intuitive and fun but quirky  .

it does not always understand your commands , but it is an early generation touch device so i give it a bit of slack  .

once you figure out how to use it though it is one of the easier devices i've used the usb transfer speed is slow beans  .

transfering the primary nin releases to the player took a good 6    8 minutes , a bit longer than expected for a usb2  .

0 compliant device it came down in price  .

i got the device for $150 canadian nib from futureshop  .

making it an incredible value for the money the comparable player has very poor sound quality compared to this device  .

even the previous gen 4 version of the comparable player had better sound quality than the other touch screen device but neither can compete with this  .

even the included earbuds are tons better  .

(but i usually only use my shure e2's or sen cx300's)  .

the screen tops our other fav player by far , it's clear , crisp , warm , and inviting a lot like their tv screens and of course the features that this player adds that are actually useful in a media player   stereo bluetooh , fm reciever (i use it all the time  .

) , fm recorder  .

, voice recorder , file explorer (great if you organize your music in folders and have napster style id3 tags (ie   wrong tagging) games on the device with the latest updates are pretty killer  .

the subway maps for vancouver and toronto are neat (but not really helpful in edmonton)  .

having some other extras that are not really needed on a media player include   address book , calculator , text file reader the one thing i really like is samsung's dnse sound engine  .

it really adds a nice kick when you need it  .

but the overall quality is pretty killer i could not be happier with this player for what i use a media player for .

p2 is an mp3 to b chosen over ipod touch , n im talking from experience  .

i had an ipod touch , the video n audio r great but incomparable with the p2  .

the video on p2 is more contrasted n clear , while ipod's are quite pale n bright , which makes it seem like its lacking of colour  .

the audio , i used the same earbuds for both devices , n the p2 comes out beta  .

the bass is unimaginably great and the quality is crystal clear  .

while ipod touch's audio are as clear n nice sounding , but wat its lacking is the bass the touch interface on p2 may not b as great as ipod , but i love it  .

its sensitive n responsive  .

wen u flick through ur music list it goes page by page , while ipod jus zooms through the list (depending on how hard u flick it)  .

i prefer page by page cus its more convenient n less chance of overlooking the song im looking for another feature is its bluetooth , where u can connect to both ur bluetooth headsetn mobile  .

n this also allows u to receive calls through ur p2 p2 is sleek n sxc , it looks great n fit into my pocket without bulging out , lyk my wallet  .

wen i showed it off to my friends , they were lyk wow , but the downside to it is , they would ask u wat brand it is , whereas for ipod , i jus know it immediately anyway , there is 1 flaw , well its not really a flaw , it jus causes inconvience  .

it is the video conversion  .

i has brought headache to me  .

this is becuase it only allows  .

svi type of video  .

so it means u have to convert it to svi , n its not easy  .

it took me hrs  .

jus to figure it out  .

but once u get a hang of it , its soo easy  .

anyway , jus to share with u , u need ur p2 to b in ums mode rather than mtp mode , n this makes everything sooo easy  .

don let the video conversion b the decider whether to get it or not  .

after all is a great device  .

i love it  .

in my opinion is pwns ipod  .

cus it has the features i wan , even tho it does not surf the net  .

but owell  .

1 more thing , the durability is awesome  .

1 of my friend has the same mp3 as me , but much longer  .

he dropped it soo many times , that its heartbreaking  .

n it survives  .

n the touch interface is per usual , jus a few scratch on the bak  .

while my other friend with ipod touch dropped it n the 1 of the column became untouchable , not responding at all  .

anyway , mayb hes jus the unluky 1 .

i've had this device for about 4    5 months now , and there is not a day i haven't loved it samsung has given us a gift that should be taken  .

first of all , the sound from the music is perfect , the clarity options you can set , and the dnse that comes with it , really boosts sound quality , if you're someone like me who is looking for a device with superb sound , this is the device to get another mentionable feature is the bluetooth , it is a great feature to have  .

as long as you get the samsung updates from their website , then the more and more capabilities you are going to receive  .

such as the capability to stream music to your bluetooth headphones , car , or speakers  .

you can also connect your device to your mobile phone so you don't have to get your phone out each time when someone calls you , you can also make calls from the device , one down part to this is that you cannot send and receive text messages from the device , but can anything do that right now through bluetooth  .

another great feature is the prime pack , which gives you a calculator , games , text file capabilities (for like lyrics or books) , an alarm , calender , address book , and a world clock another cool feature is the ability to hook up rss feeds to your device using datacasts , which using the samsung software you can link rss feeds to it and each time you plug in your device it syncs the rss feeds for you another cool feature is the fm radio , it comes with around like 24 channels you can have and you can also record songs from the radio for as long as you want (till your storage runs out) and it records them as mp3s so you can copy them to your computer later and play them there another nice feature is the videos and pictures , watching videos is really nice , you can fast forward , put into slow motion , and even change the size of the movie to fit the screen or make smaller or bigger  .

the only downside is that with the limited 8gb space storage and no capability to expand the card space makes it hard to keep space on the device for music and videos  .

but the samsung software comes with a converter so you can convert most video formats to fit the device , it supports many different video formats but also , but the samsung software does convert it to svi if you use that software , but if you choose not to use the software you can always copy files onto the device as if it were a jump drive , unlike apple who doesn't allow you to do that , as in that case you have to use the apple software to put media onto your device where as samsung allows you to use any way you like some more in depth to the dnse and clarity options   the dnse is basically a music analyzer , and what it does is it analyzes the music's frequency levels and smooths them in different ways depending on which setting you choose and it makes the sound sound a lot better  .

it also comes with a user setting , it's basically just like the graphic equalizer in windows media player for windows  .

so you get like dance , techno , rap , rock , classical , new age , etc  .

and for the clarity settings , it lets you choose how clear the sound is depending on how the song is , come songs may sound muffled so this is a great feature to have  .

it also has a feature where you can set it to street mode or regular mode and that just changes the way the music plays depending on the environment you're in as for the bluetooth and using your phone , when making or receiving calls , the setup is very easy and once it is , you use the built in microphone to talk through the device , or if you have bluetooth headphones connected to your device as well as your phone , then you can use the microphone on your bluetooth headphones if your headphones have it  .

the only downside to using your bluetooth headphones is that you cannot use the dnse with them or use the fm radio also with the world clock application that comes on it , for some reason , there is no daylight savings settings , so if you're in the us and you want to see what time it is in another country , and the us is under the daylight savings and the other country it not , the world clock will not change according to that , instead it may be off an hour depending on if you are in the day light savings time and for the touchscreen , for some reason , the touchscreen wont always respond correctly to your commands , but you get use to it and it does not bother you anymore  .

it really is not that bad , it still works just fine so far i have not had any problems with the device's software , samsung wrote this software flawlessly so you wont ever expect the device to freeze up or delete anything  .

with the 4    5 months i've owned this device , not once has it froze or disobeyed so all in all , i really recommend this device if you're someone looking for quality and loads of features  .

if i forget anything else , let me know and i'll be happy to review any more features .

samsung's latest mp3 based on the intuitive touch screen    yp    p2  .

it is considered one of the latest and as well as with the best design among all samsung mp3 players basically this mp3 is so called of a counter to the apple ipod touch  .

but if the comparisons made between itouch and p2 , the winner will be p2 instead of itouch firstly , in terms of design and interface , i can say 100% that itouch will be the top rated among the mp3 players so far in the market  .

but on the other hand if talking about features , sound system , battery condition , well , p2 will be more outstanding p2 generally is a very normal mp3 player which doesn't come with the built    in wi    fi  .

but just imagine wad for do you really need a wi    fi  .

you cannot use it if you are not in any access points or using the wireless@sg  .

so that means actually it doesn't really serve the function for an mp3 to have the wi    fi  .

you are paying the price to listen to songs or watch some video clips , not paying the price to use wireless internet access  .

on the other hand about the sound system , so far in the mp3 market there are only 2 brands with the best sound produced  .

one of them is iriver , while the other is samsung  .

iriver is using the srs (surround sound) effect while samsung is using their own dnse (digital natural sound effect)  .

comparing to mp3 players like ipod , sony and creative , their sound systems are way too far from samsung's dnse technology  .

their sound is just the built in normal equalizers , which every mp3 players will have it , even samsung  .

but , for samsung's sound , they provide you with the enhanced eq quad band and as well as the 3d and bass enhancement  .

these may not look very appealing , but it sounds superbly when you adjust the different sound system  .

it's just like if i want more bass for this or that song , i can actually set the bass to medium or max , rather than selecting classical , rock , jazz or pop these standard and fixed eq  .

for an mp3 player , the most important thing is to hear the sound and not the looks  .

definitely ipod and sony mp3 players have nice design and colours , but what's the point of buying that just for the looks , might as well get the dummy set and look at it for 24hrs , but if you get any samsung mp3 or the p2 , you can hook up your earpiece for 24hrs for the beautiful and soothing sound system  .

talking about the features of p2 , it comes in varieties  .

what does an itouch have  .

music , video , photos and wi    fi  .

that's all  .

but what does p2 has is with the additional radio , radio recoding , bluetooth , flash games , text files and alarm clock as well  .

for music , it supports mp3 and wma format , doesn't need to convert to aac or whatever other formats  .

that simple for music  .

for videos , the p2 supports either the svi or wmv format  .

for these 2 formats i need to clarify clearly as i saw some users who doesn't really know how to convert the video files there is this function known as the datacast as well  .

similar to podcast , users can syn rss feeds from internets or syn stuffs like cnn new or the bbc news or whatever and so on  .

for people who listen to podcasts , the samsung p2 comes with it as well  .

no doubt first of all for wmv format , it can only read wmv codec 9 and not any other codecs  .

so far i haven't seen any codec 9 for wmv released in the internet  .

while for the svi format , it's very simple  .

that's the format you can simply convert your video files into and playback on your p2  .

the converter is provided to the consumer free when purchased the p2 and it is actually in the samsung media studios itself  .

for video converting , do not plug in your mp3 into the computer first  .

import your video files into the video tab under the samsung media studios  .

the video files that it supports for converting are    .

avi  .

mpeg  .

wmv  .

asf  .

rmvb (real media video)  .

svi  .

mp4  .

smf  .

mov  .

you can import any of these 9 video formats in for conversion  .

and for the video quality the bit rate and the frame rate can be set up to user's choice  .

for a normal 1hr30mins  .

avi movie to convert to  .

svi format , it can go to min 150+mb but stil with high quality playback  .

that's the advantage of the video converter  .

while for itouch or any ipods , the video can only support the common  .

avi or the  .

mp4 format which is very big in terms of file size  .

what i suggest is , if you do not know anything about video conversion or the video sub codecs , then don't get the ipods because there's nothing free in the world unless you can find cracks to those applications the built in bluetooth technology is very advanced for samsung as it saves those people who do sports and they want to listen to music at the same time  .

the bluetooth function serves 3 usages  .

one of them is the wireless music streaming which the user can listen to songs without using any earpieces  .

the other usage will be making phone calls using the bt  .

this sounds crazy but ok it definitely works  .

as long as your handphone's bluetooth pairs with the p2 , any time you can make use of p2's bluetooth to call out or receive calls  .

while the last function of the bluetooth is that it can send songs directly from mp3 to handphone or handphone to mp3  .

regardless of any phones  .

and one most important thing to clarify , when listening to radio , the bluetooth doesn't work  .

as radio is streaming through infra    red technology while only songs and video can be stream via the bt for p2 while the user interface is totally touch screen with the on/off button , volume and the hold button at the side only  .

downloading of songs , pictures and videos and etc is all done by copy and paste , in another words drag and drop  .

it is very convenient  .

less than 10mins all your songs will be in , to the beautiful player that you have , and from there you can enjoy the high quality of samsung's slice of music lastly comes into the battery information  .

for audio , just purely listening to music , it can last you for 35 hrs  .

that's a rough gauge , but it depends mainly on the lcd disply , and the volume of the player  .

definitely if the player is playing at max volume , battery playback is lesser  .

while for the video is around 5 hrs solely  .

one more will be the bluetooth usage of playing back  .

when listening to songs via the bluetooth , the battery can only last for around 15hrs well , it just seems like samsung yp    p2 has great seduction to any users who want to buy a mp3 player  .

what do you expect from such a tiny player with all funtions built in  .

tempting enough to get it  .

like what i mentioned earlier on , go for the features and the sound system , do not go for the design , it is useless no matter how nice your mp3 looks , but it is useful if how superb your mp3 sounds .

best sq with the dnse technology .

i've had ipod (broke after a year , and limited music control) , zune (great software , gui , small , loved everything but no bluetooth) , and now this mp3 player the yp    p2 gives you the musical freedom you've always wanted  .

no stupid middle man software you have to use to manage your mp3 player ; can share my music how i please by dragging and dropping as i please touch screen works great , and you can customize the display buttons so it's easier for you to control your functions there are games , and other add ons  .

can play this for a few days on and off and don't have to recharge battery excellent sound , and has preset sound adjustments  .

sounds better in my car aux than any other mp3 i've used to date  .

much stronger and cleaner sound built in radio , that you can record on the fly (if info comes on to record , a song you don't know and you want to get it , etc)  .

the only thing is that it does not tell you artist and all that like the ipod does when you play the radio great size , and comes in burgundy (it's very pretty) bluetooth is awesome  .

wear wireless headphones all the time at work so i can move around without carrying my mp3 player  .

when i go snowboarding , i have all the controls on my headset and can place device wherever and not worry about tangles or ear phones snagging out of my ear the sheep on the island video is comes with is hilarious highly recommend this to anyone  .

love it  .

just like millions of other people out there i have a ipod video  .

i is walking around the nearest bestbuy at christmas time and saw the samsung mp3 player display they had set up and is impressed  .

i bought the yp    p2 on the spot  .

as soon as i got home i opened the box and put my favorite music on it and started listening to it  .

i is blown away with the sound quality , it put my ipod to shame  .

after hearing it with the headphones that came with it i had to get the bose ear bud headphones  .

even better quality  .

this little thing is absolutly amazing , the screen is brilliant and the high resolution makes movies life like  .

once again samsung has amazed me  .

everything they put out is top notch  .

i just wish they had marketed it better because this would kill the ipod with proper marketing and on top of that its half the price  .

so ive owned the p2 for about a week now and im very glad of this product , the 2gb costs nearly the 4gb of the new ipod nano and this mp3 believe me is much better i want to say that this mp3 is not a clone of the ipod touch , for you smartheads out there saying that it is  .

this is announced before the ipod touch , apple rushed with giving out the ipod touch because an touch screen mp3 player would make evreyone suprised i agree with the score that cnet put because when the p2 came out , it had unresponsive touch screen , it wasnt this cheap and it didnt have half the features it has now after the second wave  .

let me give a full review note that this is my first review of anything ever so please be kind when commenting  .

and another thing i live in sweden so dont expect evreything to be spelled exactly right right now on to the review  .

design    .

the design is absoulutley gorgeous  .

it looks sleek and nice , my friends were absoulutely amazed when they first saw how it looked  .

but still its a fingerprint magnet and it can be annoying when theres alota light that reflects on the screen because you cant see , but there have to be alot  .

the buttons on the sides is pretty good for using it without taking it out of youre pocket  .

it feels more comfortable in hand because of the size and the little extra weight that it has ( note its still lighter then the touch)  .

ui    .

the cosmos menu system is amazing , it looks so good and my friends were like wow when they saw it  .

you can put the my skin or matrix menu to show the background picture more  .

the ui isnt as fun as the ipod touches for cycling through photos and stuff but still pretty good  .

it uses double tap wich can be annoying sometimes and sometimes a blessing  .

the icons after the 2nd wave look much better and 3d like now  .

the touch screen is very responsive now so that is something you dont have to think about  .

by the way its now multi    touch like the touch so that can maybe be something that people want to have  .

i still love this mp3 with the uni    touch for rotating and doing stuff the firmware updates that is always coming to the p2 is the biggest ever made for an mp3 player  .

they are adding alot of stuff evrey time  .

let me put some sections music    .

it sounds nice with the dnse 2  .

0 , it has 10 eq presets and an custom eq with 7 bands (2 more than the normal number) and a 3d and bass setting  .

it has street and clarity modes wich fixes upp the music alot you can make 5 playlists on the go pretty fast new  in the second wave the album art and visuals have gotten bigger , theyve put a neat feature here that you can view lyrics that is very nice  .

they've added a    b and play speed wich can be useful sometimes  .

you can now cycle through album art fm radio    .

it has an inbuilt fm radio with the best response iv'e ever seen  .

it has 30 presets and a very good scanning mode  .

sadly you cant do anything else while listening to the radio new   you can fm record  .

bluetooth    .

you can use this to connect to bluetooth headphones  .

cutting the cord is pretty nice but the radio cant be used with this because it uses the cord of the headphones normally for the reception new   now you can connect to a phone through bluetooth and answer calls and talk in it with the mic on the bottom of the p2  .

you can file transfer too without any restrictions so you can get all the songs youre friends have on their phones video    .

the video lookes so good and colorful on this lcd  .

it is just fun to watch episodes and it has bookmarks for the video new   nothing new that im aware of pictures    .

pics looks gorgeous on the p2  .

the lcd is so cool and you can do a hortizonal stroke with the finger to change between them , annoyingly theres a time lag for this new   you can now rotate the pics and zoom in them with touch gestures  .

and crop them for background images datacasts    .

this is like podcasts but not live  .

this downloads rss feeds through samsung media studio evreytime you connect it to the pc after putting some sites there prime pack (extras)    .

it has a text viewer that is pretty good you can make the fonts bigger  .

a world clock , calendar , adress book so that you can call from the p2 new   theyve added 3 pretty fun games , the text viewer can now be rotated , changing the backgrounds and font color for better viewing  .

an alarm have been added as you see many features have been added to the p2 to make it better well this is the end of my review  .

i hope it will help you buying this product  .

im utterly happy with mine and i think that you will be too  .

thanks for reading  .

best regards/ syrish  .

i just put the ipod touch in comparison because many are confused between those two and they're often compared  .

dont tell me that the touch is better after jailbreak and bla bla bla because that is not how it came fabriced  .

i think both of them are good mp3 players and pretty nice actually but i just wanna break the habit of buying ipods for the premium price when there's alternatives out there  .

i'm not going to comment on how the player , i've already done that in the pros and cons  .

what i do want to comment on is the cnet's credibility , or their lack of  .

clearly they are playing favourites with apple  .

why  .

well the record speaks for it self  .

the ipod touch received an update in january to enable email and web support  .

so with the added features cnet decided to raise it's score for the ipod touch ; from an 8  .

5 to 8  .

that's fine and justified , but what about the p2  .

it received and continues to receive firmware updates  .

it has already receive a very important one , which enabled bluetooth file transfer and bluetooth calling  .

that in itself is pretty impressive  .

without a doubt , it is the first player on the market to have this feature now i'm not going to say whether having bluetooth is better than having wifi  .

but raising one score and not the other is totally unjustified  .

it just goes to show that cnet is playing favourites with apple  .

and i for one am not surprised , just look at their top mp3 player list , 1/3 of them are apple players  .

seriously , reviews need to be unbiased and objective  .

what's the point of visiting this site if all you're going to do is praise one type of media player  .

i used to trust cnet as a quality source for information , but now it's nothing more than apple land  .

do not believe me  .

then just look at all their videos , half of them have something to do with ipods/iphone the quality of this site has been going down steadily and continue so to this day  .

get your acts together and stop accepting the bags of money from apple .

cnet should redo the review i feel with the new upgraded firmware allowing the p2 to make and answer calls  .

the player is actually quite small for something with a screen this size  .

i love the simple , clean cut design  .

the player isnt as wide as the ipod touch so it can be operated using one hand (unless you're trying to get the side buttons)  .

sound quality is great and the 9    band user eq is a huge plus  .

the screen is very crisp too another nice thing is that you can drag drop files  .

although there is a program called samsung media studio , you can use the player perfectly well without it  .

i only use it to convert videos to svi format ,  .

the ui needs some getting used to  .

i thought it is very inaccurate and unresponsive until i fugured out a technique for using it  .

you have to use the tips of your fingers for more precise input  .

now i get much less errors during input , although there still is the occasional mistake overall , this is a great alternative the ipod touch .

this thing is great  .

samsung always produces high quality products and this is one of them  .

i need to buy it immeadiately but could not find it anywhere  .

amazon says 'in stock soon' but when  .

fun mp3 player for beginners  .

has good memory  .

blutooth is exellent no apps or wifi  .

go for its prodessesor the samsung p3 (it's a sure bet) .

push come to shove , it makes the evening commute much more pleasant , and with the alarm prevents me from sleeping through my stop  .

the phone blue tooth connection means my wife can get to me even when i'm listening to music  .

if my daughter could see how much nicer it is then her ipod nano i'd never hear the end of it  .

this is a great player , just beware that the fm and bluetooth do not work togeter .

this is a great player  .

i have had it a month or so and have not found anything wrong with it  .

i like that samsung offers updates  .

i use it at work and the battery lasts a long time  .

i listen to a lot of podcasts and audio books  .

when i have to turn it off and then back on , it starts where i stopped it , instead of starting at the beginning like my rca opal  .

but i do wish it had an expandable memory so i could have more videos .

possibly the most innovative feature , is the bluetooth itself  .

the only thing that comes in mind when it has bluetooth as the spec is just the ad2p , but i would have no idea about the ability to sync with your cellphone  .

the ability to talk like a cellphone certainly puts this product on par with the iphone well almost touch screen is not the biggest problem , so i wo not spaz on it  .

if its just inaccuracy , then your fingers are too big , that's it  .

or you can blame them for having a tiny interface the biggest problem is the video conversion  .

with their given software , a 25 minute video would take ahh lets say 3 hours  .

so your best bet is to find 3rd party software for this .

i got this as a present from my cousin and i is really happy when i got it since it is a touch screen mp3  .

i enjoyed my time playing around with the background since i like to customize it pictures and videos come out fantastic here and sound quality is great after using some of the audio features but after a while , the screen would become dirty and smudged beyond hope (no matter how many times i cleaned it) and when i go through long lists , it kind of lags  .

not in such a big way , but it is still a bit slower than usual but all in all , it's a real nice player if you're not the type of person who likes to fiddle around with it too much (you would not want the screen to end up like mine ^^) .

i bought the 8gb version about 2 weeks ago off of amazon for around 200 bucks which is about 50 dollars cheaper than the regular price  .

anyways , i would have to say that this device is amazing and has so much potential  .

with the new firmware updates , samsung is taking the p2 to a whole new level  .

with the 1st update , aka 1st wave , the p2 is now compatible with bluetooth devices for transfering files and answering/calling people when connected to a phone  .

also , aac format is added for a better listening experience  .

the 2nd wave is said to be release by the end of january , so it'll be interesting to see what new things will come from that update not everything is perfect  .

i would have to say that i'm disappointed in the limited number of video/picture formats for the p2 which is quite inconvenient  .

also , the p2 is only pc    compatible which breaks my heart as a mac user  .

[ i would also like to say that the p2 is quite sensitive and i do not like having to double tap something when 1 tap should be enough overall , i think that the p2 is a solid media player with some flaws , but those flaws can possibly be fixed with the upcoming firmware updates  .

without the updates , the samsung p2 is a good player , but the firmware updates make it so much better and user friendly  .

i cannot say that the p2 deserves an 8 , but i cannot give it a 9 just yet , so i'd give the p2 and 8  .

8/10 rating  .

i think that the p2 has a lot of potential and samsung is going in the right direction with these firmware updates .

i bought the p2 since i dislike ipods and the zune and clix2 are not sold in the states  .

i'm glad i got this  .

i is quite surprised at how nice it looks and sounds  .

it's got some nice eq settings and it sounds great (with the headphones in box)  .

the battery life is good for a player of this size  .

the fm tuner is nice , you can have up to 30 presets  .

it's pricey for the amount of storage space but it is an overall great player and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a player with some nice features , great sound quality and is on a budget price paid   $200  .

00 (cad) before tax , normally $270  .

00 before tax .

sounds great according to cnet and customers reviews  .

just needs more ram to get a 10  .

also , when will you guys get around to telling us the actual battery life  .

i hate when cnet leaves people hanging like this  .

i just bought this player yesterday on sale at bestbuy for the very cheap price of $150 (the 4gig model) already i can pinpoint a few problems with the player and some great advantages  .

i'll begin with the cons and move on the the pros of the device  .

the software that's provided with the device is slow and not very user friendly  .

moreover , there is very little you can do in the way of options or customization with the interface or features  .

converting video is a pain  .

i'm a pretty proficient computer user with years of experience with peripheral devices including varioud mp3 players and pdas , but i tried numerous times with numerous file types and file sizes but could not get the file to transfer to the player and play  .

the device is very limited in terms of video playback and though it is primarly and audio player , video should be just as big an asset on such a beautiful screen  .

i'm still trying to figure out how to transfer videos and i might just have to call samsung for assistance  .

the other disadvantage to point out is it's touchscreen  .

the touchscreen is not accurate what so ever  .

on numerous occasions , i had to repeat my inputs to get the player to perform the desired actions  .

the bright led light at the bottom of the device is nothing more then decoration and does not serve any practicle purpose  .

it would have been nice if it would be used as a home button like on the touch on the plus side , this is an audio player and the sound quality therefore should be the most important thing  .

i'm happy to report that the sound quality is bar none  .

samsung's sound engine technology is really impressive  .

if you're an audiophile , this mp3 player cannot be beat (take that ipod  .

the look of this palyer is also a huge pro  .

it's sleel and stylish and is the perfect size for everyday use being neither to big or to small and the player does have a nice heft to it  .

the screen is bright , clear and crisp  .

the included videos on the mp3 player played beautifully (if only i could get mine to work) and the included pictures were displayed beautifully  .

the gui is nice , but i'm hoping that in time samsung will release more options for themes and icons  .

the music player itself is well designed with many visualization effects including album art and track info  .

my favorite feature of this device and the primary reason i bought this over other players is the p2's ability to navigate through files through a file browser  .

i sort my music by folders and for me accessing that folder hierarchy is important becuase it's how i organize my music  .

the automatic library features of most mp3 players (including the ipod) really pisses me off becuase often , my music files are not properly organized because of missing id3 tags  .

with the file browser i can organize my music how i want over all the player does music very well but i'm still trying to figure out how to transfer videos  .

the touchscreen is a little bothersome but i blame that on a necessary learning curve and besides , the many dedicated tactile controls really ease the operation of the device .

well , this player is available in canada , but i'm not sure about us  .

here is my review (i actually have it) it really looks nice and is smaller than expected  .

the gui looks really nice but wo not look good with your own pictures uless they are dark  .

sound is pretty good as well as video  .

the side button are ok but it makes it impossible for one    hand operation , but i'm okay with that  .

easy to use espacially if you've used touch screens before  .

using bluetooth is quite simple , too  .

it's great that i can answer calls without touching my phone  .

most dissapointing thing though it that sometimes it lags and is slow , and the gui can get old a tiresome after a while , no matter how nice it looks  .

overall excellent player , highly reccommended of you're looking for something that is not from apple .

not too shabby  .

i specifically bought this device because it had fm radio and said it supports mpeg4  .

however , you need their software to convert mpeg4 video into some samsung format to get the video to work  .

they really should make that clear so the consumer understands that i plan to return this player since i feel like i is deceived when i purchased it  .

the sound is terrific and the interface is cool  .

i heard others complain about the difficulty in getting around with the touch screen and yes thats a problem but not a huge problem  .

you can get used to that if it was not for the lack of mpeg4 support i would highly recommend this player .

first off , i don't see why people who haven't even had this player in their hand are rating this product already  .

i bought it then less than a week later sold it on amazon  .

this is a nice player , no doubt  .

bluetooth , sound quality , bright display , stylish , what more could you ask for  .

well , how about an accurate touchscreen  .

it seemed i had to keep repeating my strokes or touching an icon multiple times just to get it right  .

frustrating  .

when using the radio you cannot use your bluetooth headphones  .

when i put my images it had no feature to rotate them so i could not put a nice picture in the background because it is always the wrong way  .

i hated the samsung studio software (the application to sync your player)  .

it took up a lot of memory , is a bit slow on transferring files , and i couldn't figure out how to convert video files into the right type for the player  .

i thought it would do it automatically but when i opened up the player to see the video it would freeze on me  .

i wish windows media player , samsung , winamp , or any other application would do something like the itunes backwards delete mode  .

if i delete something off my library then it is automatically deleted when i sync my ipod  .

the player does not have the option to delete the file without the use of a cpu , so you can imagine having to hook it up then search through the over 1 , 000 songs i had loaded on there to delete a couple files i did not want anymore  .

so , overall it's an outsanding piece of device  .

however , it is definitely lacking some user    friendly features or at least some where people with only average computer knowledge can work at it without hacking or changing things  .

definitely not for those who have a large library good for working out though when i did it with my bluetooth headphones  .

looking , nice sound , not bad screen , it's ok interface , bad .

i wanted fm music on one bluetooth device because i wear bluetooth hearing aids  .

unfortunately , the fm on the yp    p2 is not bluetooth enabled and the reception is weak  .

the yp    cannot pick up signals that my portable radio gets well , even when placed side    by    side the music sound quality is just so    so , the samsung media studio interface for my pc is not very intuitive ; although i've only been using them for a few days  .

some songs i transferred from my ipod skip like crazy , even though they're in mp3 format so far i'm not that impressed and wonder if i should not have spent a little more for an iphone with bluetooth .
