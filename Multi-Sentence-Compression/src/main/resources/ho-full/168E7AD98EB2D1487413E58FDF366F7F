this is a very convenient location for the ferry ( to be honest , nowhere in calais is very far from it ) , but in quite a dodgy area and given that there are no other eateries or bars in the vicinity ( and it would be a 25+ minute walk to any ) you are left with little choice other than to drive if there is nothing you fancy on the limited menu or if you do n't fancy paying a rather steep 9 euros for breakfast which was ok but not worth that price .
also there are no kettles in the room ( some are apparently available to borrow , but none left when we arrived at 7pm ) .
so you have to pay for coffee or tea too .
bedrooms are small , no comfortable seating and as noted , no kettle .
free wifi is good , beds were very comfortable and it was very clean .
bathroom was just about adequate - shower spray went everywhere .
it was very hot , and there was some noise from sirens and traffic during the night , but too warm to close the window .
staff were very friendly and helpful .
parking is plentiful and free , but does n't feel that secure , the security fence is high but not closed .
our friends stayed in the hotel opposite and had cheaper breakfast and rooms in what sounded like an equivalent standard .
all in all it was ok for a night , but i probably would n't stay here again , would . . .
