i've taken pictures for over 40 years and have had numerous cameras and video cameras  .
this would not be my only camera , but one i would not mind carrying with me all the time , for ease of use , portability and fun .
i could not be happier with product  .
i am amazed at the video and sound quality  .
it is easy to send videos by email and upload to your favorite websites  .
i upload to facebook and the quality is excellent  .
the other great feature is the start up time  .
3 seconds and you are shooting film , which is great if you have kids or animals  .
i watched on my 17 lcd tv and the picture and sound were perfect  .
i have not watched on my 58 yet and i not expecting the picture to be good  .
this is perfect if you want to upload to websites to share your movies with friends and family  .
i would highly recommend you pay the extra few bucks and get this one  .
do not buy it if you are expecting hd quality on a big screen .
how can you not like this thing  .
it's so simple to use , you can hand it to any school aged child to film with  .
it takes slightly more knowledge to save the videos , but my 6th grader is able to do that after one 10 minute lesson  .
the bang for the buck is very high with this product  .
the video quality with the ultra is fine for most simple web applications  .
i cannot wait to see the new hd model to see what it brings to the table  .
i only wish that they would go back to aa batteries or even 3v lithium batteries that i could replace (have a spare ready to go when traveling) and add a slot for memory for traveling  .
these two things would put this device in the near perfect catagory for a low end video recording device .
the whole concept of flip video is simplicity  .
open the box , drop in the included (regular) batteries , shoot , review , download , done  .
the camera works great  .
if you're looking to become the next spielberg , or you want to film an 8    hour epic that you plan on boring your family and friends with , this camera is not for you  .
but if you want a fun and easy to use device that fits in your pocket , you'll love this  .
the video quality is very good and makes great videos in a normally lit room , with no need for one of those spotlights that blind the subject  .
also simple is downloading  .
flip out the usb connector , plug it into your computer and voila  .
the software begins to download on your computer and you're watching your videos in a matter of minutes  .
there is no software disk or manual needed  .
cables are also included so you can watch them on your tv  .
even the product registration is simple  .
all you do is send an email to the company with your particulars and it's done  .
no surveys and boxes to click and unclick  .
i rated this product a 10  .
i don't see any reason why i would need additional memory , but again , i do not plan on filming the next hollywood blockbuster .
overall simple pocket video camera good for people on the go or people with hobbies of vloging or short film productions my video review   http  //www  .
youtube  .
com/watch  .
v  2wa49q7q79q  .
this is a state of the art product  .
better video and sound quality than all other mini portable ram chip recorders  .
software is very simple but effecitve and the avi format is so universal that it is editable by many other programs  .
good capacity    60 min  .
works well with windows xp service pack 2 but you will need a decently powerful computer to use their software for editing and downloading to youtube , etc  .
can be used without their software by dragging and dropping avi files directly off the device to your hard disk  .
they should have included a usb extension cable , the flip out port seems fragile for the long haul  .
the buttons are kind of quirky and can take several pushes to work sometimes  .
the record light on the front discourages stealth recording and seems unneccessary  .
it comes with a small thin bag , but best to purchase the sturdier carrying case  .
i dont know if it will survive a drop otherwise  .
plastic over lens is not recessed and may be subject to scratches  .
having to recharge thru computer port can be inconvenient , but an expternal usb charger accessory is available overall a remarkable product for the price and one that other manufacterers will seek to copy .
we love this camera    the non    profit i work for    christopher coppola's (nephew of francis ford , brother of nicolas cage) project accessible hollywood    has fallen in love with this product    we are now using them for our traveling new media film festivals    we empower the everyday person to tell their story    so these cameras are perfect    easy to use and can go anywhere  .
great for video bloggers  .

com  .
i love this camera and although the new mino came out recently i opted for this for a couple reasons  .
one it's cheaper  .
two is that the underwatercase is only available for the the ultra and thats a large reason i got this in the first place is for when i go snorkeling in the carribean  .
three    it has a soft to touch finish not the shiny leave fingerprint one that the mino offers  .
although there are some downsides    i cant use the built in software to its full advantage with my mac and the audio isnt the greatest but for 150 bucks its well worth it and i am not worrying about taking thousands of dollars of eqipment into the water  .
this camera is the easiest i've ever worked with  .
3 members of my family have one (including myself) and i is delighted to not have to show them how to use it longer than 30 seconds of training  .
the quality is good , the optional underwater housing is a great feature  .
the camera interface only has a few buttons , hopefully they will add some special effects to the next model  .
i myself would love it to have tons of buttons and features if it did not take away from the functionality of the camera  .
remember you will need to get aquainted with a video editor like ms movie maker if you want to upload a movie to youtube that is longer than 3 min or so due to the native file size .
considering the size , price and video quality , this camera is hard beaten  .
im sure for the price there are cameras out there with as good and better quality and with more features but theres none that fit comfortably in your pocket and are tough flexible enough to use in almost any environment i also bought an adjustable tripod ('gorilla tripod')and it is the perfect accessory at the time as i is going travelling  .
i had this camera with me everywhere and apart from actually in water , i had this with me at all times used it as a 'helmet    cam' when we went ziplining , caving and even rafting  .
this really is where the flip comes into its own , its ideal for spur of the moment filming and outdoors activity unfortunately mine is since stolen but ive no hesitation in buying a flip again (hopefully with more memory)  .
it's great for what it is  .
a starter video camera .
this is a good value for the money paid  .
of course , you cannot expect top quality video if you paid such a low price  .
i had very little trouble downloading  .
used the flip software , even got good snapshots off the video  .
i like to save my videos elsewhere anyway  .
what if the camera gets lost of stolen  .
one should always back    up any video of value anyway  .
i would not use it as a primary video for a wedding and expect professional quality , but it's a good general purpose , fun camera  .
it's one of those 'pass it around at the wedding' or 'use it at the kid's birthday party' types it's well on it's way in the next few versions if these improvements keep up  .
and , while i quite like macs anyone who owns one knows that given to microsoft marketing over the 20 years , pc software tends to rule  .
hopefully , flip will address the mac in an upcoming version .
great for the price  .
($149 wal    mart  .
com ; shipped to local store for free  .
) the one i received had a defect w/software communication via usb  .
emailed online support , and got a call within a day  .
tech (who is fantastic  .
) determined it is product defect , and sent replacement via 2    day ups , with rma return label  .
new one works great  .
the tiny condenser microphone is good close range , without lots of extra background noise , but it would be nice if i could plug in a hand    held or shotgun mic  .
with no removable or expandable memory , if filming a 1 hour meeting , you may lose the end if the meeting runs long  .
i also bought flip video tripod and action    mount , very pleased with both of those  .
mu    vee software lacks fade/ title functions , so i need to find alternative editing software , but i figured that i would .
okay , so it's not exactly the quality of my panasonic , but for filming the grandkids carrying on or the puppy getting into trouble , it beats the heck out of getting out the camera bag and finding an unused minidv cassette so that by the time i'm ready to film the fun is over and the kids have moved on  .
my husband surprised me with this for christmas and i had the camera up and running so fast i is able to get some great film of the family while they were still opening their gifts  .
later i plugged it into my laptop to email the video to friends and family out of state and it took about ten minutes  .
pretty cool .
good camera , but storage and editing problems persist even with the updated software  .
in this day and age when everyone stores on external drives , they ought to have an import feature that allows you to import from other drives  .
even windows movie    maker is better in this regard .
i received the 1 gb version of this product (30 minutes of recording time) for christmas , and it is great  .
having small children means wishing you had the camcorder available at all times , and this product makes it possible  .
it is convenient to carry around and takes very good quality video as long as you do not plan to watch in full    screen mode  .
the file size is very large since there is very little compression of the video  .
so , emailing a video as an attachment is not really an option  .
thankfully , the built    in software makes it easy to send someone an email with a link to view the video  .
some users complain that deleting a video from the camcorder results in it also being deleted from their library on their computer , but i have not experienced that issue  .
all of my videos are saved on my computer using the one    click option in the software , and my camcorder is empty right now with the full capacity available  .
my only complaint is that the record button is difficult to press and requires a couple attempts to start/stop recording , so it is possible to miss the first few seconds of your intended video  .
all in all , i am really pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of this small and inexpensive camcorder .
for me , a complete novice in the digital video field , this device is great for me to practice with  .
the price is right , and i is able to learn a few tricks  .
i captured my bus ride to work , but the voices were drowned out by the diesel sound  .
a bargain for the price .
the instructions say that once the ready sign appears , you just need to push the red start/stop button to initiate the video  .
on my unit , this does not happen right away  .
i have to push the button over and over and then all of a sudden the video starts  .
by the time it starts the spontaneous video moment has gone .
when i first read about the ultra in this comparison   besthdcamcorderreview  .
com/flip    ultra    hd    vs    aiptek    action    hd    gvs    1080p    2/ , i thought it is underrated and i think i am write , the price is great .
i've purchased several camcorders over the past years  .
i still think that the future of filming for the average user will be with a hand held flash memory product like this  .
right now most of what i use are minidv camcorders and i think it would be unfair to compare them to this flip camera since their video quality is definitely better in comparing this to my canon powershot , i still would pick the powershot but they are comparable in many aspects here are some highlights that i've come up with in regards to this camera    .
the battery charges via usb  .
that's good and bad  .
it's good because it's convenient  .
it's bad since it takes a long time to fully charge and you cannot use your camera while it's charging    transfer could be faster  .
if for some reason you're interested in filming an event that is a bit longer than the capacity on your camera it's not a quick process to transfer the video to your computer  .
i own the 120 min hd version and to transfer a full 120 min to my computer takes about 20 min  .
the transfer rate that i get is around 4mb/sec  .
when i transfer using external hds i usually get somewhere from 13mb/sec to 25mb/sec    it doesn't take pictures  .
i guess the people at flip were trying to make this simple and straight forward , but i still think that the ability to take a quick picture is a good feature to have    the software that comes with the camera is pretty useless imo  .
if you've used any video software you will not be interested in using this one    the picture while filming in the lcd looks better than what it does for real  .
when i is filming for the first times in low light , i is looking in the lcd and i is super impressed thinking that it is filming great because things still seems bright and defined  .
when i transfered the videos to my computer , i noticed that this was not the case and that the videos were actually pretty dark and very grainy    no instant capture  .
again , i know this is intentional , but it really would be convenient if you could hook this up to your computer and have it be recognized as a video device  .
it would allow you to use other applications to record your video and it wouldn't have disk space or battery life limitations like it does    the mic is pretty good  .
it's very directional so it will really pick up well what's in front of it , and the sounds behind it will be much fainter  .
so if you are used to narrating while you are filming something , take that into consideration since your voice will be very faint since you're behind the mic    does it really need a flip usb device  .
i'd be happy with just a mini usb slot on it  .
the flip out usb stick is attractive but does take up a lot of space for a device which is trying to be as portable as possible  .
the flip out usb stick is short and if you are trying to plug it into your laptop for example , and you have something else plugged in , you're not going to have an easy time  .
i already have started taking around an extension usbchord with me to make sure i don't have problems with plugging it in harder to get to places    i bought a black flip that had a rubbery type finish on it  .
grease marks from your fingers will quickly appear all over your camera  .
i don't know really how to solve this one , but i don't feel like i have this problem with any of my other small electronics    fyi on the video size   1  .
5 hours of very basic filming (i just left it filming the wall) took up about 3  .
2 gb  .
i'm not sure if the battery gave out or not , but it did just stop filming on it's own after 1  .
5 hours even though it still had enough space on it to film another full hour at least  .
(when filming motionless targets , you'll get more footage than advertised)    there are no video settings  .
the only settings you have are the date , if you want it to beep or not , and if you want the red light to come on when you are recording  .
i just assumed that i could film in something like 800x600 or something less than the full hd mode , but that's not an option    the zoom is very weak  .
i'm guessing it's about a 2 times digital zoom  .
so you'll need to make sure that you're right up close to whatever you want to film with this camera    it only has hmdi out  .
if you like hdmi , than that's great , if you like other video formats , you'll need a converter and those aren't cheap    i wish it had a lens cover so those are my thoughts for now at least  .
in the end i would not recommend this product and i'd probably suggest a real camcorder or even a digital camera like a canon power shot that had hd if that's what you wanted .
the quality of the video is no better then one shot on a cellphone , which is fine for the money , but do not expect your videos to look anything like the clips they show in the on    line ads or on the website  .
the focus is soft and the images are low contrast and low resolution .
i love and miss my flip  .
i am trying to get it repaired , but flip support is blowing me off  .
i am a huge fan , and been recommending these to everyone i know that travels  .
but regardless , still being blown off by their support  .
loyal customers/advocates , pshhh don  .
t need em  .
i am more than happy to share the chat logs with any interested , but the short is , i have cracked lcd screen in back and nearly 2/3 of it is black as a result  .
they do not care no options to get it repaired  .
ridiculous  .
unfortunately , this poor experience with the support contact has take a product that i love and boast about and dropped it below some equipment that i had and hated it feels like when your favorite toy as a kid is broken by a neighbor or sibling (in my case with the flip , an airline) and then you ask your dad to fix it , and told no  .
not that it cannot be done , just no unfortunately , the experience with flip support is turning me from a true fan of the product to the complete opposite side of the fence side note (i have chosen to include the email log so far subject        .

if your camcorder develops a problem within the 90 day warranty period    .
my flip video developed lines on the screen (you could not see the video) after trouble shooting with technical they had me return it  .
a few weeks later i get it back with a letter saying it could not be repaired so it is replaced  .
the problem is that i sent a camera in that is in like new condition without a scratch or a fingerprint on it and what i got back is a camera with many scratches including one on the screen itself  .
after numerous phone calls and promises that someone will get back to me no one has  .
i find it ironic that they will allow you to return your camera to them within 90 days of purchase for a full refund if you are not completely satisfied (you have to have purchased it from them directly)yet mine is defective and is returned within 90 days and i get a uses one back  .
i guess i now know what they are doing with returns from the unsatisfied customers  .
i have posted the warranty information below please submit a request to customer support detailing the nature of the problem  .
we will attempt to resolve this issue for you and if not resolved , provide you with further direction to have your camcorder repaired or replaced with a refurbished unit .
this camera is a great idea/ product from a company who lacks the customer support (unlike the old days) to make it truly great  .
my camera has worked but not to the ability the company says it can  .
they wo not send me a new one .
it's not a very good product , even though i'm a kid and i don't expect much , i should say that other camcorders like the sony bloggie  .
do not buy it , i'm selling it on ebay to get a bloggie .
if you have an apple computer do not purchase the flip video  .
flip's requirement that you download software to view the video or have a flip connected is just nonsense  .
buy a nice canon camera , powershot sd1200 is like i have , about the same price , takes hd stills , no    nonsense avi files , you'll be much happier .
flip should include some instructions and information which will warn people about loosing all of their precious , unique footage when all files are overwritten automatically if the user plus in a second/different flip .
the concept is good and i is really excited to receive my flip as a gift from my parents that live across the country  .
they were also excited to be able to see video of their 1 yr old grandchild  .
unfortunately , the device never worked correctly and i is only able to send 2 videos before it broke  .
i spent an endless amount of time corresponding with the flip customer service both via email and over the phone  .
i is asked the same questions over and over again and told on numberous occassions that the problem would need to elevated to their teir 2 customer service  .
after 3 months of trying everything they suggested they finally agreed that i should send the flip back to them and they would replace it  .
i shipped it back to them (on my dime) and received the same device back in the mail about 2 weeks later  .
the outcome , it still had the same exact problem it did before it is shipped  .
i left a not so nice vm with their corporate office but never received a call back from them i do not suggest purchasing one of these  .
3 problems , 2 big ones    .
1) if you only want to have 60 minutes of video forever , this is for you  .
however , if you want to download videos and save them , you cannot save more than 60 minutes worth  .
you can save them to your desktop , but your camcorder will still show as full  .
you can delete the files you've saved in the library or delete them in the camcorder , but then they are permanently gone  .
really  .
the intended use is taking vidoes , posting them , then deleting them hmmmmm  .
customer service is also pretty lame of course you cannot speak with anyone , you only get an email response that is unclear 2) software bugs now my videos automatically close after 1 second of play time quick time says it's encountered a problem this is even with the firmware update  .
please don't frustrate yourself and buy this it's deceptive it sounds like a great product       i is one of the first to buy one       and you will love the videos you shoot , but you may never be able to access them or to shoot more than 60 minutes worth  .
i don't know about you but i do not like some souless corporation messing with my videos 3) customer support is lame but what do you expect  .
1) does not have image stabilization and is extremely tough to get smooth video  .
2) although frame resolution is nice , the camera appears not capable to keep    up with streaming frame rates necessary for hd , therefore sound and video frames are clearly lost , resulting in very brief lapses which is a big problem to me  .
3) i'm really unhappy that their software version 4  .
5 supported (at minimum) export to wmv but version 5 does not output anything except their proprietary mp4 format  .
why not output it in something that major consumer/pro editor suites can utilize (import) like avi  .
technical services department at flip    video were not very helpful either  .
this looks like a flash    in    the    pan  .
posters who criticize non    tech users completely miss the point  .
i would not be surprised if they were pure digital shills  .
especially in that they seem to have knowledge way beyond what is included in the software package or attainable on the lame support site  .
the whole point and advertising representation of this product is that it is supposed to be easy , which it is clearly not if you must be tech savy  .
thank you flip , for erasing my daughters birthday videos with your forced firmware update which said all video would be safe  .
halley'scomet is dead on  .
this product is terrible and certainly not what it represents itself to be  .
2 thumbs down .
i purchased the flip video and is instantly amazed by the simplicy and intuitive engineering of the device  .
i is an extremely happy customer until i needed support  .
every once in a while i would turn on the camera and instead of getting a video image , i got a black screen  .
restarting the unit usually took care of the issue now after a year , i only get this black screen and nothing else , the camera will no longer function  .
i contacted pure digital technologies for assistance and we began the troubleshooting process  .
i is told to take out the batteries for 2 days and put in fresh ones and try again  .
this did not work  .
pure digitals response  .
they informed me i is past my 90 day warranty and sorry for the inconvenience  .
case closed and marked solved  .
they have chosen not to respond to any further requests for help a quick search on the net showed me that i am not alone with this problem this appears to be occuring rather often with their product and they are unwilling to stand behind their quality if your purchase happened more than 90 days ago  .
this is by far the weakest link in pure didgital technologies flip video chain  .
my advice spend the extra $ and get another manufacturer's product that is built to last  .
as cool as this video camera was , consumer electronics should not be a crap shoot .

i am confused by your answer to this query  .
although the most recent version of flipshare does not include a file converter , you are welcome to try third    party applications to convert the file from avi or mp4  .
according to your online web page flip software does convert to  .
mov on the mac (see below) just not how it is accomplished  .
that is my question question  .
if i want to convert my videos into a video format other than h  .
264/mp4 , how do i do that  .
answer  .
the videos recorded with your flip ultrahd camcorder are captured using h  .
264 video compression and aac audio compression , saved as an mp4 file  .
using the flipshare program that runs from your camcorder , you can convert your videos into a more compact size and format for emailing or uploading (wmv on windows and mov on macintosh)  .
once your videos are converted , they are saved in folders on your desktop  .
for more information on using these features , review the section on saving videos regards ,  .

this cam does not replace a standard digital recorder  .

she loved it for its ease of use and uploading to you tub  .

regardless of where the recording took place a visit to the amazon forum on this device is crowded with similar experiences i have no choice but to return it  .
a great disappointment given all of the positive reviews i read before purchasing it .
most decent digital photo cameras already come with this same video feature incorporated into the camera  .
the resolution it very low compared to true digital and all you need to do is add $50 and you have any number of digital camera on the market to choose from  .
true it is easy to use but it appears marketed to the mentally challenged who have to use velcro on their shoes and still think the 3 stooges are funny  .
spend the extra few dollars and get a decent name brand camera .
this is a great idea for a camera however , i think it needs some work  .
i feel pure digital needed to do some more beta testing before this camera hit the shelves  .
i do think pure digital is heading in the right direction .
don't buy until they figure out their sign problems  .
customer service is friendly but they do not know how to process returns  .
let them work out their problems before buying .
i is almost on the point of buying one of these , warrenty and support is poor or limited too many are going faulty so its design fault or quality control you should all qualify for a free exchange or refund  .

flip staff ,  .
i have tried to go through customer service tech help , but the site always  .
seems to be down (go figure)  .
my flip camcorder looks like new , because i have been able to use it only  .
twice  .
i received it through dell with the purchase of a pc the model is flip video it has ceased to move past the initial start up screen , i called your tech  .
line and stayed on terminal ignore forever , then left  .
a message , which is real tricky to do (it doesn  .
t work well either)  .
i have now waited over a week and a half for a call back , nothing i have tried new batteries , leaving them out for 72 hours ,  .
even did all the other hokey    pokey type crap talked about all over the  .
internet to no avail i have come to the conclusion after reading everything i can about this  .
thing that it is junk the fact that you supply not nearly enough tech help exasperates the  .
problem i have contacted dell and told them they need to check their vendors out  .
better and left a complaint with them about you're complete lack of customer  .

yeah , after the 72 hour rest the camera needed to work it loaded up fine , but as soon as i turned it off , it wouldn't reload again i did not buy the camera to sit on the shelf with the batteries out 12/01/2008 so i guess i should feel lucky it lasted this long  .

as i said , it is junk  .
90 days pfft i have a sony camcorder that is 10 years old , no problems i will be sure to pass on all over the internet just what a low quality piece of crap you sell , so others will not repeat my mistake in trying you're products updated  .
on jul 12 , 2009  .
good concept i 'll try someone elses version to see if they got it right or at least better .
it is great the first day she used it , however on the second day , it completely shut down  .
we thought it is the batteries , we went out and bought new rechargeable batteries and that was not the cause  .
we just happened to buy one that is a defect  .
it's nice to know that we were not the only ones who bought one that is defective  .
my daughter had saved up all of her allowance and went with the flip b/c of the media and advertisements  .
she wishes she went with a lesser known and cheaper camera  .
we have never been so dissatisfied with a product and for the campany to not back up their product is unnacceptable  .
if you get a defective one , you're screwed  .
this company believes that saving the money on one unit is not worth the bad pr of just ignoring problems .
could not even get to see the video at all  .
