no problem with quality, performance, etc .

t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses .

performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe .

good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .

engine performance is very lacking .

it has room, performance, good mpg for its size and excellent reliability .

overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .

if you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !

the performance is incredible !

i'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .
