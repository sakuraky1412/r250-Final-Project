this hotel opened about six months ago and is a very nice property .
to start , the location is great ; just a short walk from kirkwood with a lot of restaurant and activities in the area .
the rooms are very large and clean , and we were extremely happy with our suite .
we also had drinks one night at the bar , and that was a nice area to hang out as well .
also , the staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful , with multiple people greeting us each time we come in and leave the hotel .
there were just 2 annoyances with this property .
the first is 150 rooms with 120 parking spaces = a problem on football weekends .
the do contract with other parking garages in the area to get around this , but this could have been handled a bit better .
the second issue was just 3 pieces of equipment in the exercise room , which was a problem when i went to exercise .
the good news is that if you head down the hill past the parking garage and take a left past city hall , i happened upon the b line trail , which is a wide paved pedestrian walk way which was a great place to go for a morning run , and fortunately the weather was good .
in any case , i would stay here again without hesitation , and park off-site if i could not get in their garage , as the location and quality . . .
