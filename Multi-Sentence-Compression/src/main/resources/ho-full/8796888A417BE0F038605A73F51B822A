we stayed here for our anniversary in may 2016 and it was our second stay here , the first time was when it was a best western chain hotel , now it 's part of the lhp ( not that it means anything ) .
overall , it 's a very clean hotel and it was nice to stay there again .
however , there are a few things i 'd like to see .
the air conditioning is not controlled by the room and only by reception , so we were constantly asking for them to turn it on and turn it down as the room was quite warm all the time .
there is no tea and coffee making facilities in the room , which we missed a lot !
having to always ask for a cup of tea ( being english ) at the bar was quite tiresome .
breakfast was lovely though , typical european with great choice .
the lobby/bar area is small and only the reception staff tend to it when needed , the prices are n't too bad for a hotel though .
wi-fi was shocking , although free , it was very intermittent and dropped a lot wherever you were .
room security could be an issue as we came back one afternoon to the door being left wide open and no sign of a cleaner or house keeping around , so anyone could enter , thank god we had any valuable 's in the safe !
it 's always a pleasure to stay in florence and it was nice to return to the . . .

it 's always a pleasure to stay in florence and it was nice to return to the hotel , but if we were to go back to florence , we may seek an alternative ( just for a change ) .
