brisbane is the gem australia doesnt showcases as vividly as it does the other 2 - melbourne and sydney .
brisbane is beautiful , has a great serpentine river and has great places promoting arts and culture .
brissie downtown or cbd as its called down under is not huge compared to melb or syndey but its very convenient and has great hotels and waterfront restaurants .
hotels and businesses are closeby too and thus you can walk around in the city with no need to hail a cab .
downtown is neat , safe and clean and thus walking is pleasant .
i have stayed at several hotels in brissie but this time , it was a last minute trip and thus couldnt book in advance to get good rates and thus opted for this best western .
technically it is in cbd itself but there are several hotels which are in core cbd , this one is on an elevated portion of the cbd and thus if you are walking , you either have to climb several stairs or hike up 3-4 blocks some pretty steep streets to/from cbd .
lobby isnt impressive and the hotel has 2 wings , i got a room in the wing which was on the other end of the hotel 's long walkway to the elevator .
rooms were plaid and there was a promo going on so i got a nice champagne in the package which was great .
i didnt had breakfast at this hotel as . . .

so if you dont get a good deal in the heart of cbd , you may opt for this one , it wont disappoint but it wont excite u either , if u know what i mean.
