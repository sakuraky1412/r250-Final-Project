i had read other reviews here complaining of the distance to 'town ' and that there was not much surrounding the hotel ( does a cvs count nearby ? !
) but this didnt bother us at all .
parking was a breeze with plenty of parks and we 'd upgraded our double queen room to a one bedroom suite which we were very happy with .
this hotel was our favorite on our 3 week us holiday and am so glad we came and stayed here .
our room had a great view overlooking the pools and marina- in fact all rooms have a balcony and good views .
despite staying here over the nye period , we never had any noise or crowd issues at all .
location is def 20 min out of the 'city ' but this didnt bother us at all as we liked being away from the hustle and bustle .
the pools were lovely , never busy and getting a sun lounger was no problem at all ( ie you do not need to go down at 6am to 'reserve ' your spot !
) .
there is a mini satellite starbucks cafe/stand by the cafe which was handy though wait times can be long if only ther 's only one person working the till and making the coffees .
all the photos on tripadvisor and social media are accurate of this place-it really is a lovely place to visit and get some r and r .
