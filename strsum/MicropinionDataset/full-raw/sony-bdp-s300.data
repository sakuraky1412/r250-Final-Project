i is on the fence of the format war for hd    dvd vs blu    ray for a long time  .
i did have an non hdmi xbox 360 and the hd    dvd player accessory but i thought the video quality is average (maybe the movie is just horrible    the new king kong)  .
i went to a chain store website looking into a next gen player and knowing that blu ray has most of the studios i like and the better reviews , i picked this up for $300 and also got the original dawn of the dead blu    ray disk  .
i started playing dawn and it is spectacular video quality definitely outstripping the hd    dvd drive (movie king kong) i'd had with my xbox  .
then i played 2 regular dvd's on the sony order of the phoenix and d  .
s both of which have special effects and the upconversion is amazing even better than my oppo 970 player  .
the oppo is still hooked up since it plays all regions of regular dvd's  .
i did not care about the audio decoders which are missing since most of the time i watch with tv audio and rarely use my 5  .
1 surround sound system .
overall , i have been very happy with this player  .
it lacks a lot of cool features like bd    live and a good dts hd or dolby true hd out , but it has great playback and is up    to    date with the majority of new blu    rays that are coming out  .
i would recommend this to anyone who wants a stable blu    ray player that has the capability to give them that 1080p look that they have been wanting  .
the lack of 1  .
3 hdmi out hurts this product , but it will still give you that prestine hd picture .
i bought this player last saturday and i just love the picture and sound quality  .
at first i felt a little disappointed due to lack of dolby true hd support , but after surfing the web i found that with 3  .
90 firmware update the player can decode this hd sound format so in overall this machine is great , just one issue   slooow loading times  .
the sony bdp    s300 second generation blu    ray disc player is entry level player  .
if you are a novice who is just learning about hdtv    video and you cant afford a top end player this is a model for you  .
i purchesd my reconditioned blue    ray from greys on line for $365 with 12monts warranty i'm useing a phillips 42 plasma with built in hd , and a dennon avr 2700 amp my sony blu    ray took me around 10 minutes to set up useing a hdmi cable and then run a rca lead from my digital out on the tv to the digital input on my amp and got dolby digital sound from my amp (yes)  .
the latest firmware version for the sony bdp    s300 is  .
version 3  .
8 and if you have this version then a lot of the problems mentioned in other reviews have been addresed , and your hd video playing experiance should be very enjoyable .
i have a newer 50 hd samsung plasma tv    a newer onkyo hd receiver  .
i is enjoying my hd cable and dvd movies at least i thought i is happy  .
when i got the blu    ray player everything came alive  .
i could see and hear the difference immediately , and the audio just blew me away  .
true dolby digital ex    i immediately added the 2 add'l speakers (back    surround) making my system now 8 speakers incl  .
the sub woofer  .
i will never visit a movie theater again i've got it better right in my family room  .
i'm am now shopping out for another sony blu    ray player for my bedroom hd system it's an incredible bargain for $299  .
you will love it btw , treat yourself to the top of line harmony (880  .
) do    it    all remote you'll be controlling everything with one remote color display programmed on your computer all buttons light up ino the dark  .
enjoy  .
after reading all the opinions i was not sure if i should buy this $299  .
blu    ray at best buy  .
i recently bought a panasonic 50 1080 plasma so i of course needed either a blu    ray or hd dvd player  .
most people told me to go with the blu    ray although i think the hd looks just as good after downloading the latest firmware (easy  .
)it is off to watch spiderman 3  .
although the machine took a minute to load the movie it was not a big deal  .
everything about the player worked perfect during the movie  .
unless your some high end a/v person this player is the right choice .
this second generation bd is great  .
there is a little wait in loading sometimes but it lets you get settled before the movie begins  .
i recommended this player , we watch alot of movies and have not had any problems  .
it is very easy to set set up and the quality is fantastic  .
great player and after plugging in the required connectons on my new sharp aquios 42 lcd the picture quality is stunning  .
after reading a few other reviews i will agree that loading does take time and rather slow  .
this is right from opening of the tray and the subsequent loading of the dvd  .
overall a great player and am tempted to go in for another one , but i think i will wait till the dust settles down on pricing and other options .
sure it doesn't decode some sound formats or have some high    end features , but it plays bd dvd discs with amazing quality  .
the reviewer seems very nitpicky and thinks that we all want ps3s  .
i'm not a kid and i do not want some akward pseudo    player  .
i wanted something that fit in my rack , looks like it belongs there and has a proper remote  .
it's not worth $50    100 more to get a silly game machine .
i find this blue ray player excellent for stand alone player  .
the followings are my findings price   $499 direct sale from sony online  .
it is a good price for second generation  .
plus 5 free blue ray movies , a good selections to choose from each category  .
i chose 2 animation movies , chicken little , corpse bride for my kids , 3 other action movies for myself  .
these 5 movies could cost over $100  .
so the player itself should only cost $300  .
the price is a good as panasonic dmp    bd10a blue ray player ($ 600 from amazon) , but it has a front cover , that is a draw back  .
so i chose this player instead design   it is good for second gen player , thinner than previous sony model , but thicker than regular dvd player  .
clean looking unit  .
nice gray light remote controller   very design , can be used to turn on other sony devices , tv , dvd player etc  .
i have not explored other features yet since i just used the basic functions  .
i wish it could glow in the dark like mitsubishi dlp tv remote controller i have  .
that is nice to have when the room is dark connections   bdp    s300 has a good array of connections  .
i only use hmdi cable  .
you can get hmdi calbe at sam's club or costco for much cheaper price picture qualities    .
blue ray discs   excellent pictures at 1080p , i watched planet earth and casino royale on blue ray , it is super quality  .
very sharp  .
it is tested with mitsubishi dlp tv  .
it should look great with any hi def tv with max 1080p , i have not tested with 1080i , i assume it should look great too dvd upconvertion   i tested with alexandria , dvd movie , the pictures look clear and sharp at 1080p resolution , much better than regular dvd player at 480 , but compared to blue ray , blue ray pictures are superb  .
sharper , clearer , crispier than dvd upconversion  .
blue ray movies are much more superior in picture quality  .
so the rankings are    .
blue ray pictures  .
superb 2  .
dvd upconvertion to 1080p , excellent 3  .
regular dvd movie  .
good loading time   both dvd and blue ray discs took about 18    20 sec abit longer than regular psp 3 and regular dvd player , but not that long as i read from other reviews and cnet reviews  .
maybe this unit is new and all loaded with updated firmware , i just got on july 15 2007 ejection time   2    3 seconds , the tray slides , i think it is comparable to other players overall   excellent unit , good price , go for it , if you plan to have sony stand alone player for second generation , and other sony av and sony hi def tv  .
they should hook up nicely with each other  .
i plan to get a new sony hi def tv for living room it is coming out in falls 2007 , i will hook up with this blue ray blayer for the whole family to enjoy , right now it is in my master bedroom anyway , this unit is not obsolete in 2    3 years , by then it is worth $400 of using  .
then it should be under $150 in 2    3 years , and time to get new and give this one out as gift i hope my findings are helpful for your decisions .
a blu    ray player is really a must have for anyone that has an hd television  .
sony has finally released a machine capable of playing blu    ray movies at a price a few more consumers may find attractive or a bit more affordable  .
this device is capable of reaching up to max hd , which is 1080p , but for those that have a tv that only makes it up to 720p , this device is still worth it and a huge difference will be noticed over a dvd player and dvd movies for those that are audio fanatics i would really recommend the previous sony model or even the new samsung blu    ray players  .
for those that are ok with high quality dolby    plus , and want a really nice picture on their tv for a great deal , than this machine is perfect many are still ify about investing on a blu    ray player because of fear that their investment may go down the drain because of hd    dvd  .
i really do feel the time has come for the fall of hd    dvd  .
blu    ray has far more supporters and is currently outselling hd    dvd sales 2  1 (as far as movies go) , and it is projected that within the next two years sales of hd    dvd players will be about 4    million while those of blu    ray players will be over 50    million (including the ps3)  .
then there are many that feel that the ps3 is a better deal than any stand alone blu    ray player , which is true  .
not only does the ps3 add the lack of dolby hd the s300 does not have , but it will also allow game play  .
the only downside to the ps3 is that it can not be controlled with a harmony remote , and many (including me) do not feel it looks nice as a blu    ray player in a home    theater set    up  .
i have two hd televisions at home , so i will likely get the ps3 for the other tv once the 80gb version comes out in aug of 2007 over an other blu    ray player anyways , sorry for getting into the ps3  .
be sure to use an hdmi cable , or component and optical to get the best possible picture with your s300 or any blu    ray player  .
i tried the player on both a 720p samsung lcd , and a 1080p sony lcd , it looks great on both , so anyone with a 720p or better tv will be amazed by the vivid colors and the new options of blu    ray movies i purchased mine at sears , and the sales people there are great  .
they are far more knowledgeable than other electronic stores  .
so for those that need help buying a new tv or need help choosing the right blu    ray player , i highly recommend going there  .
the only thing is i had to wait about a week , because it had to be ordered , but it is worth it .
i just paid to have a full hd set up done in march , i  .
hdtv , bose system , receiver , etc all the while knowing this blu ray is coming out soon  .
tech guy told me if i ever swapped out units he'd need to do it in order to reprogam  .
i bought sony , called him , he flaked , i unpacked , pulled out old dvd player , plugged in new sony swapping out cables (hdmi power only)  .
when powered on , the sony dvd set up is easy for a 2    yr old  .
i then popped in a movie i purposely bought in order to experience unit and all is fantastic  .
too simply an experience for such a great picture  .
please note , i do not get in to tray load times , etc in reviewing a dvd player  .
others might  .
if i get an awesome picture and fantastic sound i am happy  .
i know the difference between tv and blu ray  .
this is a real treat .
i waited to buy this sony unit with great expectations  .
i is not let down on the video department  .
it looks fantastic on my sony 1080p lcd via hdmi  .
regular dvds look great as well i do not care if it can decode every audio mode  .
i rather have the receiver do the decoding , just like i've always done before  .
the new receivers are now hitting the market , so i am glad sony released a lower cost unit that lets me redirect the savings to a new receiver my only complaint , is like most others , is the reposiveness of the unit  .
the power up , eject , and loading does take a while  .
i thought this would have been much faster by now  .
but this is quickly forgotten when the video comes up  .
it's a great player  .
(he , c|net , fix the price  .
) it came out at $499 , not $599 as anticipated it works great , and is upgradeable  .
so you can expect this to help put a nail through the heart of hd    dvd , which may be cheaper , but is looking less and less viable .
i bought the unit three weeks ago , the picture and audio quality with blue    ray discs so far has been flawless  .
the up conversion of regular dvd's is first rate i recommend a quick read of the manual before turning the unit on for the first time  .
just to prep you for the one time setup the easy setup is just that  .
simple and straight forward  .
i selected auto for the video format (i use a hdmi cable) the unit automatically found the correct resolution bottom line for $499 you get a second generation player that's easy to setup and use , with future features built in at a price lower than discounted first gen units .
i am really happy with this player  .
i told my wife and son that i would use it for a few days and see whether there is an appreciable difference between it and the oppo when playing hd material  .
wow  .
like wow  .
is there a difference  .
i played casino royale first  .
at the beginning there is a black and white scene , a part of which features lots of shiny chome , oh my gosh the picture quality just stunned me  .
farther into the film , the flesh tones , texture and colour of the sea    just fantastic  .
we then watched babel    and had a similar experince    amazing quality  .
two thumbs way up  .
i have been watching the planet earth dvds    too much  .
easy setup  .
great video and audio quality  .
i is immediately sold and my wife is as well  .
she is going to get our $500 back if it didn't look great there are those out there that say don't spend the money , an up    converter is adequate until the hd wars are over but you know what , they have no idea what they're saying  .
no comparison  .
up    converting just gives you brighter colors but does not get rid of any pixelation or color banding , which are even more apparent on hdtv you still have to careful of what movies you buy though  .
read up on them before purchase  .
some transfers are horrible and will make the player look bad when it actually is the disk .
love everything about this unit and i have the ability to compare both hd    dvd and blue    ray  .
now , i have to consider that my hd    dvd is the add on for my xbox    360 so it may be at a slight disadvantage but even so , i will have to give the nod to blue    ray for over all picture quality and a big nod on sound  .
blue    ray just seems to do both better  .
this player is simple but looks great with the blue tint and single glowing light when on  .
connetions are plenty for all modern recievers or most hd televisions  .
i will say that if you have the option of hdmi , use it  .
the very first startup and setup does take a minute ( as they clearly note in the paperwork) but even after that , powering on to tray opening seems to take a bit long  .
in any case , it is the only real complaint i have and is a very minor one at that  .
i watched the itailian job as my first movie on this unit and compared it side by side with a standard version of the movie i have just to see what the deal was  .
to say blue    ray looks and sounds better would be the understatement of the year  .
there really is no comparison to be honest  .
what we have all gotten used to watching over the years with dvd is not even half of what blue    ray offers in picture and sound  .
i am extremmly happy with this unit and running it with my yamaha reciever and jbl surround setup makes for one more reason to save the 10 bucks and watch a movie at home  .
when rental stores start offering more titles in hd , i will be in heaven having both technologies on hand keeps me covered untill one format wins the war , until then , i will enjoy both  .
for the price , 499  .
99 when i bought , its a reasonable exspense to get next generation technology  .
go for it .
i love my bdp    s300 blu    ray  .
picture quality is excellent and so is the dolby digital 5  .
1 (sorry , i do not have dolby hd)  .
as reported by someone else previously (poor picture with flicker in certain sections) , i have found nothing of the sort  .
it is connected to a toshiba 64 dlp with 1080p native resolution the only troubling thing is that blockbuster reported only having blu    ray dvds from now on and when i went to two different blockbusters , neither had even one blu    ray dvd for rental  .
i've gotten them on blockbuster online so this really is not a problem but it is very strange that retail stores do not have them .
so , a quick look at the manual for this unit reveals that indeed it does support truehd sound  .
i'm puzzled how the reviewer got this important feature wrong perhaps they should rtfm before the make inaccurate claims  .
the manual is available at http  //www  .
docs  .
sony  .
com/release/bdps300  .
pdf page 48 shows truehd as a supported 5  .
1 channel pcm output on bd    rom .
i believe that i got a great deal  .
i do not mine updating mine through the mail (no ethernet port)  .
for the price that i paid $250 (2 years ago) , i'm not going to complain updated  .
on feb 15 , 2009  .
this is a pretty versatile player for one with supposedly no frills  .
standard dvd's look great , and blu ray is stunning the load times for bd can be slow , up to 2  .
5    3 minutes , but that's my only complaint .
i love this player  .
i originally bought a less expensive model just to see if there is really a big difference in the blu ray and regular movies  .
there is so i decided to go with the sony  .
i love that it also upconverts my old movies really well  .
you can upgrade the firmware , contrary to what people will tell you  .
just go to sony  .
com and they give you directions on how to do it  .
i'm not really into all the high tech stuff like the true hd audio and whatnot , so this player is good for people like myself who are really only interested in a great picture and who don't want to spend a lot of money (new technology is coming out all the time)  .
though i do recommend the ps3 if you are a person who likes to game  .
you get a whole bunch of cool features but you do not get an upconversion player .
this is a great value for the money at under $300    comparable in price to a higher end upscaler + hdmi cable , but you get to watch bds too  .
nice way to get into hd video , but if you're looking for the absolute best bd player , this is not it  .
lack of true hd audio support and some graininess in dvd upscaling are unfortunate , but can be overlooked at this price point  .
i am satisfied with this purchase .
having owned this blu ray for three weeks and having paired it with my sony 50 sxrd i have to say this player does what i need it to do realize the 1080p capabilities of my tv  .
yes , it loads slower than my oppo (not a big deal) and cannot utilize some of the advanced feature in the future of some blu ray discs (i watch movies on dvds not play interactive games or even watch the making of features or whatever that are included on most dvds)  .
once again the only gripe i have is that there is no resume feature so i can pick up where i left off  .
set up is simple (the defaults are rather curious so take time to set the audio and video preferences) and the picture and sound is amazing  .
for the price this is a winner  .
and if anyone is worried about which format will win the war just look at about 3 big box retailers to see which format has the most titles available in store that did it for me  .
i've owned many sonys over the years  .
my expectations are good solid value , reliability , and frustrating user manuals  .
my experience with this player is no different so far  .
for the price i paid ($399 cad or $419 usd + 5 free blu ray movies) it is an excellent deal  .
note i got this price as part of a bundle with a sony bravia w series 46 lcd  .
if i had to pay $599 for this player , i'd probably give it only a six or seven  .
for the most part , the cnet editorial review is spot    on  .
however , as most reviewers , they focus on the negative and lack of high    end features that most of us can (will) live without  .
true , the player lacks support for the new audio formats    in my case i am hooking up to a lcd tv (l/r stereo speakers anyone  .
) i also have a connection to an old sony 5  .
1 home theater    in    a    box which only supports dolby digital and dts thru coax or optial (no analog or hdmi  .
) so for me , the lack of these advanced audio formats is not really a bad thing  .
as long as i can output in either dolby 5  .
1 or dts format over digital connection , i'm happy  .
the tv doesn't care as it only has 2 speakers anyway    cannot get more basic that l/r stereo  .
upconverting regular dvds looks good  .
i watched portions of the extended version lotr   return of the king and it is excellent  .
on evan almighty i noticed aspects of the opening scenes i didn't see on my old dvd player (although i suspect that's mostly due to moving from a 27 crt to 46 lcd tv  .
my biggest headache is configuring the player to control my lcd over hdmi and configure the audio to convert audio to dolby or dts (the default settings are odd) once i figured that out , it is smooth sailing  .
note , it only took me about 5 minutes to do this , the menus are quite easy  .
the manual , while ok , is typical sony , it explains things (sort of) while raising as many questions as answers 24p is a nice feature if you have a tv that supports it  .
also , if you have a sony bravia tv , putting a disc in and pressing play switches the tv on and changes to the correct input so there is less hassle and button mashing (great when you are trying to explain to 60 y  .
o parents how to put in that disney dvd for the grandchildren    less button pushing is a god    send  .
lack of sacd support is a pain and limits future use if you have an extensive library (i also own an oppo dvd player so not an issue for me) lack of ethernet port  .
who cares  .
i don't have any network connection anywhere near my tv  .
if i need firmware updates , i'll burn to a cd  .
wireless network too slow for hd content  .
so this aspect of the review is really nit    picking  .
most people will never miss this  .
i is just glad to see a coax audio in addition to optical  .
my tv only has optical which sucks if you need or only have a spare coax port in your receiver dvd load times are good  .
blu ray (spider man 3) times are long (get a cold one while waiting  .
) the most frustrating part is waiting to open the tray after powering on the player  .
cannot the tray open right away while the processor boots up  .
it seems like you stand there forever waiting for the tray to open  .
if you are not patient (like me) and stab at the open/close button many times or too soon after the power on cycle , the display goes from power on to close and the tray never moves  .
ok , calm down , try again , wait , press open , wait , tray opens , drop disc in , tray closes , long wait times for blu ray now that i understand how long the long wait times are , i've adapted so that its really just a minor annoyance than a deal breaker  .
i understand most bd players are quite slow  .
this sony may just be slower than most  .
note if you have six year olds at your house , they aren't as patient  .
the unit itself looks cool  .
the blue lights , logo , and ability to dim the front panel from bright to off could be useful at times  .
seems solid and well built  .
buttons on top of player may be obscured by a larger component on top  .
my vcr lives on top of my blu ray and it doesn't complain , but it's only half the size overall rating   a good player if you cannot wait (like me) for basic blu ray  .
try to get it at the lowest price possible  .
i personally wouldn't have bought this at the full ($599) price and my rating would have been lower if i had  .
i probably wouldn't have purchased at all if i hadn't been forced into buying a new tv (my old crt died on halloween  .
boo  .
) however , for $399 (cad) + 5 free movies it was not a bad deal , especially if you do not need all the kick @ss audio output options $399 8 out of 10 , $599 ; 7 out of 10 .
i have the s300 hooked up to a pioneer rptv at 1080i , and the picture quality is outstanding  .
lack of advanced audio codec support is not a big deal because there are few players that can output the bitstream and fewer still avrs that can decode them  .
also , a future firmware update would allow for decoding in the player for output over the 5  .
1 channel analog outputs  .
considered the panasonic dmp    bd10a and samsung bd    p1200 , but chose the sony due to price and brand reputation  .
very good sd dvd player as well .
i bought both the sony bdp    s300 and samsung bd    p1200 one week apart , and connected both to my sony kdsr60xbr2  .
after a week comparing the two , i've decided to return the bdp    s300 , but it was not an easy choice  .
both these blu    ray players perform well , but the main difference is in upconversion of standard dvds and speed of loading java    enabled blu    ray discs  .
samsung is better in both respects  .
i had to perform the firmware upgrade to the bd    p1200 , and after that most of the early    reported glitches disappeared (yes , i had them all  .
i still get a brief pause on one disc (7 years in tibet) when layers are switched , but it's very minor and worth the trade    off for better upconversion and speed  .
maybe a future firmware release will fix this minor shortcoming as well  .
the notoriously problematic pirates of the caribbean blu    ray loads and runs flawlessly on both machines , but loads twice as quickly on the samsung  .
i am aware that the samsung also offers hdmi 1  .
3 unlike the sony , but from a performance point of view with current tv and receiver i cannot tell the difference  .
the samsung has an ethernet port for upgrading , the sony does not , however you can burn a cd and upgrade firmware on either machine that way so this is not a big deal  .
imho , the sony has a better menu system than the samsung , but maybe that's because i've gotten used to an upconverting sony dvd player after all these years , including the typical sony remote  .
i have set both players to bitstream audio out and connected to my higher    end (but not es    series) sony receiver for decoding dolby digital , etc  .
sound connected this way seems the same from both players  .
again , i might notice a difference if i were to use a higher    end receiver  .
and lastly , for what it's worth , somehow the sony's pq on blu    ray seems ever    so    slightly softer , but with ever    so    slightly less motion artifacts  .
these are minor differences , but i do prefer the samsung's sharper pq overall  .
at first , i is sure i prefered the color balance of the samsung over the sony , but after a week i'm beginning to think it's my imagination  .
i am posting this review on both the sony bdp    s300 and samsung bd    p1200 review pages  .
the price (as of july 2007) of the samsung bd    p1200 has dropped to near the price of the sony bdp    s300 and so i feel it's a fair comparison  .
i am rating the samsung a 9 , and the sony an 8 .
the only real complaint and reason i gave this player an 8 is the slow time it takes for that loading tray to open  .
if you leave a dvd in it and want to take it out , prepare to stare at the player for a good minute  .
whistle your favorite tunes and think back on how much faster that old junk player you used to have would open  .
i can deal with the load times when i go watch a movie but to have to wait just to eject anyways , watch any movie on it and be ready to be amazed  .
i even think my old dvds look as good as blu    ray  .
very impressive on the upconversion to 1080  .
you will never watch movies on another player  .
it does have its side effects , now my friends keep bringing their movies to watch them on the player one other thing i did not like is the size , it still needs one more generation to shed some weight and gain some speed , but you can not go wrong with this baby  .
it has everything you expect and need for that top of the art home cinema  .
i just bought a blu    ray bdp    s300 it has a mind blowing picture and audio quality but while playing a disc whenever there is darker area like a tree or mountain shadow the picture started flickering , reason is the player will not play certain types of blu    ray disc formats , so i called sony to send me a firmware upgrade which sony claims should solve the problem , so waiting for the firmware and without the firmware the player plays a bad quality of regular dvd's aswell .
yes , as an owner the review is very accurate on the player  .
however , those of you looking at this player much keep up with the firmware updates so that load times improve  .
sony frequently releases firmware updates that improve the performance of the player and other features  .
the issue is that the technology will change day to day and it's difficult for any hardware vendor to keep up  .
the player allows you to update by burning a firmware image to a disk and then loading it to the player  .

this is the least expensive blu    ray to date (i got it at costco for $270) and it does the job of playing blu    ray on my 61in dlp panasonic but it's not that great and really slow just pressing the power button takes minutes to start  .
even ejecting a disk is a long process  .
what's the deal with that  .
how is it that this takes so long  .
but , when it's up and running , it looks great  .
the quality is good but the remote is not that great in the layout it's a great deal but spending more money may provide better performance .
definitely slow to load up movies but not terrible  .
for most people it has all of the features you would want in a player  .
good with dvds too  .
only complaint is lack of truehd for me for future proofing .
i like the player even more now that sony has released a new version 4  .
20 of the firmware  .
the player now supports dolby truehd audio decoding with the update  .
thanks sony  .
while the bdp    s300 is not the best player available , it is affordable  .
if it had not come as part of a package deal with my sony hdtv purchase , it is not the player i would have purchased  .
it is only 1  .
0 profile and doesn't appear to be upgradeable to 1  .
1 or 2  .
0 via a firmware release  .
keeping the firmware updated will assist in overall playback  .
the s300 does not decode the latest lossless audio codecs  .
with that stated , the s300 does offer excellent picture quality , and the dolby digital audio is decoded fine  .
it's a great little player for introducing one to the blu    ray experience  .
i would not give it up , but i do hope to upgrade to a faster player in the future .
i purchased this player at sears for $239 , which is a great price the player setup is easy to do and pretty well thought out  .
no complaints the picture quality is great no complaints the downside is the players performance to make sure the player is up to the latest firmware and capabilities , i upgraded the firmware to the most recent 3  .
8 (which is not the easiest thing to do , requires downloading new file and burning an iso image disc which windows xp cannot do without additional software) this player is extremely slow to do anything power on and wait (to open the disc drawer  .
) , put the disc in and wait for the player to recognise the disc and load i'm not talking 10 seconds here , i am talking 3 minutes to start spider man 3  .
i also have a ps3 , none of this fooling around and waiting like with the bdp    s300 i am not overly disappointed with this player because of the price and i am using it as a secondary player on an other tv  .
there are definitely better players out there if you do not like to wait  .
i think the ps3 is the way to go it is so much more than just a blue ray player and it is not that much more money .
i bought mine about a month ago  .
fortunately , i chose blu    ray , and for that decision alone , i'm never playing the lottery  .
i've used up all of my luck for the year  .
i love the minimalist design of the box  .
clean , black and glossy  .
a fingerprint magnet , but it's just beautiful and is a good example of sony's terrific engineering and design  .
it's also got a snazzy remote (thought the top menu button is hard to find at first) , but who am i kidding  .
it's getting stuffed into my harmony remote at the next opportunity hook ups are simple and easy  .
it took longer to unpack than install  .
it also came with about 8 free blu    ray dvds through special offers and rebates (still waiting on those  .
plus the pricey monster hdmi came with a few free disks , too so it is a nice deal  .
i'm sure those offers will dry up with hd    dvd now dead  .
there's no incentive for them to try and lure people over with handsome deals pictures are frankly perfect  .
i watched harry potter's latest right off , and just pearl harbor the other day , and as a blu    ray player , it's what you'd expect  .
great images  .
i have a good sound system and it didn't disappoint there either the one place this player really shines is in up    converting standard definition dvds  .
i've been consistently impressed by how great the pictures look from low res disks the only real drawback is load time  .
you'd think you were starting up a tivo for how long you wait for the thing to start up  .
so take some points off for that  .
load times on disks are not great either  .
you could rationalize it by saying there's time to cook the popcorn but , it is under $500 bucks , and delivers great pictures  .
being fair , the load times are abysmal , by most standards i'm not sorry i bought this player , though i might give the panasonic an evaluation before picking again it's good , but certainly not very good or excellent  .
i'm a very tough grader  .
an 8 or above ought to knock my socks off in every area  .
but you buy a blu    ray player for video quality first , and it delivers quite well in that area .
i admit this player does have a great picture but too expensive when compared to the equally comparable hd dvd by toshiba  .
i originally went with this player because sony does make great products but for the money i chose to take it back and by the toshiba hd    d3  .
best decision i have ever made  .
i cannot honestly tell you that there is a difference in picture quality between the two and any one who does is flat out lieing  .
if you want to spend two to three hundred dollars more then buy the sony  .
but the only difference is price and manufacuterer when it comes to picture quality between blu    ray and hd dvd  .
hd dvd all the way  .
sorry sony i think you already lost this one .
i bought this blu    ray player 3 weeks ago , and have for the most part thoroughly enjoyed the incredible detail of the movies i've watched in 1080p  .
the unit itself has a very high quality and solid feel to it  .
it also has one of the best remotes that i have ever had come with any dvd player  .
the buttons on the player and the remote have a crisp and responsive feel  .
but there is still room for improvement  .
the time it takes from when it is turned on to the time it allows you to open the disk tray takes way too long  .
the second problem i have with the bdp    300 is that it has frozen up on me several times when i skip chapters  .
not just a momentary pause , but to the point that it becomes unresponsive to anything but opening the disk tray or turning the power off/on  .
i also wish that it would remember where i left off in a movie when i turn it off  .
my $110 sony upconvert dvd player does this , so i am a little surprised this 2nd generation , top of the line blu    ray player does not have this basic feature  .
i'm going to take this unit back and wait for the 3rd generation blu    ray player from sony to come out  .
hopefully many of the short coming will be fixed , and more features added .
i like my bdp    s300 blu    ray  .
picture quality is excellent and so is the dolby digital 5  .
1 (sorry , i do not have dolby hd)  .
as reported by someone else previously (poor picture with flicker in certain sections) , i have found sections in blu    ray playback where the picture freezes  .
it then skips to another section a couple of seconds further in the movie i just returned it to sony (under warranty) and they replaced the main board and also updated the firmware to version 3  .
80 ; we'll see if this helps it is connected to a toshiba 64 dlp with 1080p native resolution i am able to rent blu    ray dvds on blockbuster online and understand their availability in the blockbuster stores is increasing .
i picked this up the same time i got a 1080p hdtv  .
picture quality is as advertized and is quite impressive  .
no complaints there  .
the problem is that it takes for ever to respond to commands  .
it is annoying not only because of the delay but because it does not even acknowledge the command for a number of seconds  .
i am debating taking it back .
since this player is first announced , i is optimistic sony's second player to the market would be a quality product  .
unfortunately this is not the case with the bdp    s300  .
out of the box the player comes with a green piece of paper warning of slow start time for first time use    it is slow all the time  .
press the power on button on the remote and wait 45 seconds before you can load a disc  .
slow response to scanning forward and backwards and discs coded with java menus took several minutes to load  .
overall a disappointing product .
junk  .
you would think sony would have perfected blu    ray players (since they invented blu    ray)  .
even with the firmware upgrade i decided to look elsewhere  .
whatever happened to sony  .
i am planning on junking it and getting a better and faster loading machine .
i bought the bdp    s300 about three weeks ago and is initially amazed by the picture  .
however , the slow load times on certain blu ray movies really started to annoy me  .
not knowing if it is something i could easily fix with a firmware update i started researching the player a bit more apparently the slow load times are inherent with this system and nothing can be done to correct it  .
add to that certain features that are missing such as sacd support and i soon felt like the player does not justify a $400 price tag after doing some more research i decided to exchange my bdp    300s for a playstation 3  .
the ps3 is the same price , delivers just as good if not better picture quality , and with the last update (2  .
30) supports every audio and video format as the more expensive players  .
the load times are much faster , updates can be downloaded and installed via wired/wireless network and you get a next gen gaming system to boot so unless you want a player that takes longer to load the movie than it takes to microwave your popcorn , i would spend the $400 on a ps3 instead .
this blu    ray player looks nice and blends in with the rest of my components , but the lack of audio decoders really makes it an expensive player  .
also , the load times are extremely slow  .
the good part about it is the automatic upscalling  .
the price is kind of expensive  .
i payed $400 for it  .
$400 is a lot for a blu    ray player with these features compared to panasonics dmp    bd30k which is about $400 to $500 .
i is given this player as a gift  .
i have never been happy with a sony product , i always buy panasonic  .
my brother has this same player and i knew his is horribly slow  .
i opened my player thinking maybe his is just defective/broken but it's just as bad  .
i timed the startup time at around 54 seconds before you actually see the sony logo on the tv and can open the cd tray  .
i also timed movie startup time from the time a disk is inserted  .
it took a little over 2 minutes to finally start to play spider    man 3  .
i returned this player in exchange for a ps3 which can play a blu ray movie in as little as 54 seconds  .
too bad the ps3 does not have infrared , i am actually exchanging it for a panasonic dmp    bd30k .
you would expect a new format player to actually do everything a new format is setup to do  .
this model leaves out all the high    end audio options bottom line way too much money to be spending to just get a high def picture  .
i get high def , 5  .
1 surround sound free from tv stations broadcasting in high def and easily available from cable and sattelite providers give the consumer a reason to buy blu    ray disc player , better sound options (high end pcm , dts , truehd and sacd)  .
you do realize the ps2 even outputs 1080i and it cost $120 now)  .
ease of connectivity via hdmi or update the optical cable to do all of this one review got it rigt and and said buy a ps3  .
go with the 80 gb and sony continues to issue firmware updates to the ps3 that supports all these new options via hdmi http  //www  .
ps3sacd  .
com  .
basically a useless model , avoid at all costs and wait until they start getting serious about pricing and options , otherwise you will just end up needing to buy another one .
the player gets great reviews from users    but i do not get it  .
we've spent half our time waiting for it to power up and load discs , whether blu    ray or standard dvd format  .
i bought it to watch movies , not the blue screen of death  .
if i can figure the thing out in the next few days , i'll keep it and modify this review  .
if not , it's money back time and samsung here we come .
this is not a bad piece of equipment but the time needed to start the unit drags along , even my toshiba hd    dvd player , well known to be long is not as bad  .
the menus in my opinion are kind of basic  .
the first disc inserted (even if i is able to read it no problem)gave me a message asking me to upgrade the firmware the only way is by burning an iso image to a cd    r annoying otherwise , this is a good way to enjoy hd movies at a price becoming affordable .
i just recently purchased a bdp    s300  .
the unit looks very good with my other home theatre gear and operates silently the video and audio quality is superb , as is to be expected the one thing that really lets this player down is that it takes  forever  to load discs  .
as mentioned in the cnet review , it truly does take approximately 3 mins to load pirates of the caribbean  .
it takes a similar amount of time to load any one of discs in the spider    man trilogy another thing to look out for is that this player does not support truehd or dts hd ma and probably wont    ever  .
i'm not hugely concerned about this , but it is a shame that i would probably have to buy a new player to get that functionality one last thing as the blu    ray specification is still not complete , as the new specifications are approved    it is highly unlikely the player will be able to take advantage of them via a firmware update  .
again    it's a shame that it is a high probability that a new player would need to be purchased in order to take advantage of future blu    ray features overall , if you are looking for lower cost entry in to hd and are not too concerned about slow loading discs , the absolute highest quality sound or being able to take advantage of soon to be added capabilities    then this would be a good choice  .
in all honesty , you are probably better off buying a ps3 (or a toshiba hd dvd player/xbox 360 with hd dvd add on) .
do not buy  .
unless they pay you to take it cause its that big of a head ache .
again , the main disadvantage to this player is how damn long it takes to get fired up and ready to play a dvd  .
and there are these annoying series of loud clicks and noised the entire time too  .
it's so bad , i finally quit watching blu    ray movies because of this  .
i'm buying a new player and it will not be a sony  .
i did not head the warnings that others have posted about this player and bought it anyway  .
i am very sorry i did and less than 2 months after i am returning it for a refund  .
the start up time just to insert a disk is pathetic and then you wait for what seems like and eternity for the movie to load  .
do not purchase this player .
if i would have known that this player would not play any of my homemade dvds or mp3s , i would have never purchased  .
i produced these cds and dvds using roxio  .
very disappointed in the product's inability to play anything but store bought dvds .
my sony blu    ray broke after 6    weeks (it just would no longer read discs) and i contacted sony because it is under warranty  .
i is extremely disappointed to find out that i have to ship the disc player to pennsylvania (from arizona) , pay for the shipping charges , make sure it is packaged properly and wait for up to 10    days or longer before i receive the same player back , just repaired  .
after something stops working after 6    weeks it should be replaced  .
if i wanted to buy a refurbished disc player , i would have and i would have saved money  .
now i have payed full price for a refurbished player that i am convinced will continue to have problems  .
i went with sony blu    ray when i could have purchased an hd disc player  .
boy did i make a mistake , i hope other consumers do not make the same mistake i did .
i purchased the blu    ray player at costco for under $500 and easily hooked it up and watched a movie  .
the next morning i started i fired it up for the kids and the remote wouldn't work (no , the kids had not touched it)  .
the remote is required to scroll through startup options for most of my kids' dvds so i opted for a different model when i returned it today  .
i hate return trips to the store when i buy things and my personal experiences with this dvd player as well as a dvd burner (dvdirect) that i purchased indicate that sony's quality is slipping severely  .
maybe quality is better when their products were manufactured in japan instead of china .
wow $499  .
great price  .
then you take it home open the box and read a little piece of paper that states that this unit requires a firmware update  .
then you set it up and pop in a movie  .
which it can not play , must be that firmware update they mentioned  .
then you pop in another movie and half way through it , it freezes  .
by freezes i mean lose of all function to bd player and must be restarted by unplugging the device  .
back to bestbuy it goes and traded in for a samsung , that i might mention requires no firmware update .
all these loyal sony blu ray , fans that have not really looked at picture nor listened to sound quality in an unbiased manner  .
then truly recommend what's best hd dvd picture and sound is truly awesome when compared to blu ray  .
standard dvd played on hd dvd player looks closer to blu ray playing hd disc  .
outdated too soon , customer support is very poor .
its the slowest , most painful piece of electronics i own  .
if sony had any self respect , they'd go around and replace these machines .
very slow to start  .
then , very slow to eject  .
then , agonizingly slow to recognize the disc and display start    menu  .
sometimes it does not even complete these basic tasks  .
often , i'm not even sure it's working  .
i am frequently forced to seek work    arounds and play the discs from a beginning chapter it also displays weird progress bars ; sometimes it displays nothing  .
in sum , usability is terrible  .
sony's product developers and their executive leadership should be embarrassed by this product  .
sorry but they need to hear this feedback on a good note , however , the sound and image quality really are excellent if you can stomach all the uncertainty with the start    up .
poor product  .
you have to have a computer to update the firmware and there are a lot better products out there .
bootup    the household is furious my the time its done  .
no doubt you can thank java powered for that , in general its slugish all the time , and you need to reboot it get it to start playing a disc from the beginning or sit there clicking back through all chapters  .
restarting from the title menu always sends you back to where you last left off .
388$ waste  .
looks grainy and the ps3 had the same quality do not waste your money  .
just bought this unit last oct  .
07 , it stop reading blu ray disc and regular one  .
i'm not gonna waste my time to send for repair its in my garbage can already  .
first , does not come with any high def cables  .
just standard audio cables and one rca jack to hook up video  .
machine does have slow load times , which would be great if that is it's only problem  .
pirates of the caribean will not play once you stop it or eject it  .
you will have to power down or unplug it if you dare stop the movie  .
it will just say cannot read disk  .
(multiple times  .
then the audio will not work in 5  .
1 surround at all  .
hookep up an optical connection , and the audio stutters very badly , like the player cannot process out the signal  .
(my hdvd player works perfectly , with the same cable and connection) going to return it  .
hdvd seems to be the clear cut winner , if the blu ray have this many problems , and i really wanted the blu ray to win  .
do not buy  .
blu ray is still not ready for consumers .
if you have or will have a collection of sacd music disks , forget this machine  .
will not support sony super cd technology  .
why  .
circuit city is shocked when i asked them to play a sacd  .
does not work  .
what a marketing blunder  .
i suspect a lot of high end users will return this product  .
i will wait for version 3  .
maybe this product will begin to work faster    with global warming but in the meantime the effect is glacial  .
oh    mac users , you do not exist as far as sony customer service is concerned  .
want an upgrade it's snail mail  .
downloads for [some] windows users only .
this is the last sony product that i will buy .
this is a prime example of the risk you take being an early adopter of a new technology  .
blueray discs look fantastic on our hd projector but this particular first generation player should be avoided  .
this is the most frustrating and ridiculous electronic product i have ever used in my life i am a fan of sony products but this player is shaking my confidence in them this player behaves like it has no clue as to what it is and what it is supposed to be doing for instance , let  .
s say you want to take the disk out of the unit and the unit is off  .
push the power button and it takes approximately 45 seconds before the eject button will do anything  .
push the power on button with a disk in the unit and you are looking at waiting about a minute before the fbi warning shows up i have one blue    ray disks that it won  .
t play at all and one disk that will play the previews then goes through about 2 minutes a screen that says loading  .
loading  .
loading before showing the movie menu  .
then when i click on  .
play movie  .
the screen goes blank and the player shuts completely off then restarts one might read this and wonder if there is something wrong with the disks so i should add that i also have a playstation 3 and it plays all of my disks with no problems i have 2 sony digital cameras , 2 sony video cameras , sony psp , sony ps2 and sony ps3 and i have been completely happy with all of these products sony really screwed up with this player .
buy another product , not this one .
for the price this is a terrible choice  .
takes over a minute to boot up , and remote comands sometimes dont respond .
do not rush out and buy this junk that i wasted money on  .
sony is selling these knowing they are not up to the standard they will release later  .
and read the web sites that i did not , about not being able to update later  .
i am trying to dump mine on ebay and sticking with my dvd upconvert  .
shame on you sony  .
