this is one compact feature packed gps  .
if you are concerned about the cost wait a couple of years before you buy one  .
with the garmin topo cd you have one very powerful , mobil , position and information system .
too many positives to list  .
a couple sugestions to garmin  .
once a new route is created it would be so much easier to add waypoints to this new route (instead of having to pick the route every time) or having to add the points to the route later , also when a track is saved it would be alot better if you could review the elevation points as you can when the track is active  .
one of the more awesome things is the seamless compatibility with software like the very inexpensive microsofts streets and trips  .
put your laptop next to you and connect your etrex  .
the accuracy and real time tracking in the mapping software is incredible  .
you can even get incredible coordinate accuracy from streets and trips to compare .
you can download a lot of maps , but works vey well without them , so many features i cannot handle them all  .
i use this in the car while traveling for work  .
it is a fine gps  .
outstanding performance , waas works great  .
foe extended trips you need the power cord it uses battery quickly .
got this as a christmas gift from my wife  .
have been using it in our travels on vacation and weekend trips  .
also comes in handy with my job as a deputy sheriff/k    9 handler  .
sometimes had trouble getting a signal but usually clears up when i get it right  .
have not gotten any of the add    on maps and such yet , but planning to do so soon  .
definately get the rechargable batteries and charger  .
they're well worth the added expense .
this is definitly a full featured handheld gps  .
it's a bit pricey , but has functions not found in any other  .
i use it with mapsource metroguide usa  .
it takes about 4 seconds to find the nearest gas station , restuarant (by type of food , or exit  .
battery life could be better (15hrs with compass turned off)  .
if you travel , this can be a great asset  .
great all around gps  .
plenty of memory for high res maps  .
works fine in the car , great in the field and is amazing on the water  .
a bit hard on the batteries though (6hrs)  .
this unit has everything you could want  .
i keep being surprised at the functionality this unit has  .
i'm also very impressed with garmin's support  .
they just released a new firmware version that add significant functionality to the unit which only adds value to my investment  .
coupled with the mapsource cd's this is an great gps solution  .
you'll never be lost again  .
the more i am using it , the more i get exited about it's quality , ease of software upgrading  .
two minor , however understandable issues   downloads only mapsource maps , no db9 male 0 modem cable to connect to ipaq in garmin's cable assortment .
coupled with the mapsource software , this is equal to any onboard navigational tool  .
also great on the trail .
i've had this for about six months  .
it is so easy to work my wife , not a gadget person , usually does the navigating  .
other have commented on how accurate the readings are .
learn something new every day  .
more information than i can process  .
constantly finding new applications .
poor mans street pilot iii  .
use internet address finder and drop the coordinates into the vista via the mapsource software  .
download the relevant county your traveling in (maximum of 64 , i believe) away you go & purchase the mapsource roads and recreation add    on and your almost there  .
ok , it isnt that easy  .
lows   lack of external antenna connection a problem , lack of driving directions in the software , loss of signal driving through falling snow proved a problem , totally screwed my pre    planned route up  .
deviation from your planned routes proves a problem when using it on the road  .
highs   use it anywhere , in the open , in the car etc  .
it is rugged , built with quality , firmware and software upgrades freely available online  .
locks quickly into signals in built up areas  .
nice easy to see backlight during night driving  .
the accuracy is simply amazing  .
tracked me up and down both sides of a carriageway , and even the route i took across an intersection  .
(12    15ft accuracy) plenty of features youll be using months from now  .
a very impressive piece of kit which although not specialized for driving directions , still performs remarkably well .
this unit has great features , is very well constructed , and has a nice display , but the receiver is sub    par  .
only moderate tree cover or clouds will block reception of the receiver  .
also when walking/hiking i find that i have to keep the unit held up at chest level or it sometimes loses reception even in the open  .
i also have a magellan map 330 which almost never loses reception except in the thickest of woods or heavy cloud cover  .
i bought the unit primarily to keep track of how far i walk and hike and also to trasfer track info  .
to topo maps  .
but the unit loses reception so often that it is useless for this purpose  .
if your travels are mostly in the open , such as boating , etc  .
then it is a good choice  .
support is too expensive especially for outdated map info  .
so for my purpose i give it a thumbs down .
it has everything you need but it need a auto    routing and driving directions  .
this is a simple problem that garmin can fix with a software updat so why dont thay  .
value   a little spendy , but worth it if size matters  .
shop around , i've seen it for $277 at ecost  .
com  .
support   garmin seems to be listening to their customers (they've implemeted a number of user suggestions in their software updates)  .
garmin updates their software often and seems committed to getting things right  .
quality   i dinged it here because some of the unit's lcd can be slightly out of line with the bezel  .
this does not affect performance , just aesthetics  .
features   the only things missing are auto    routing and tidal data , both of which i think could be addressed with a software update .
a well    meaning brother gave me the e trex vista last christmas  .
the map that comes with it is worthless  .
you can find more detail on free state maps  .
i purchased a better but over    priced map from garmin (roads recreation , about 100  .
00) that you can download into your computer , map your routes , and then download the map and routes into the e trex  .
you can also map routes directly on the e trex , but i found the process so tedious that after two hours of toture , i nearly smashed the unit  .
although the unit e    trex can accurately navigate you along your route , you will need a magnifying glass to see it  .
i could not see the names of streets unless i zoomed in to maximum magnification  .
at that point the screen looses all context of where you are or where you are going i  .
, the name of the steet fills the screen and you see little else  .
although the unit seems accurate and includes an altimeter , clock and compass , i plan to return mine  .
if you need a gps , buy one with a large screen ; otherwise you may walk off a cliff .
i bought an etrex vista for hiking a few years ago  .
however , it has consistently been very poor  .
it never works with any sort of tree cover or in a city  .
perhaps acceptable , but it also fails to work most of the time even in the open , even at the summit of a mountain  .
i used this thing on a daily basis for work for about two weeks  .
the reception got slower and slower until finally it just did not recieve satellites at all , on a clear day in the wide open  .
worked great until then  .
then i had to reset it to get it to work again and lost all my waypoints  .
then it stopped working again  .
if you see this thing and it looks like a good price , avoid it at all costs  .
the cheaper model etrex's work much better .
i have used this device for at work everyday for more than a year now so i can say i have indeed tested it  .
the only reason i put up with it is simply because i did not have the money to buy a good unit , such as the 60 csx  .
this thing will just shut off by itself in the middle of nowhere  .
i once left in on the roof of my car (in cool , clear weather) for 8 hours and it didnt not pick up a signal  .
it may have a dozen features but if the main feature (    to tell you where you are or where you are going    ) doesnt work then it's just an expensive paperweight  .
do not buy this unit  .
get the 60csx  .
it is lightyears better .
i bought a garmin etrex  .
during the first year , the springs in the battery compartment broke because they are badly engineered  .
garmin customer support refused to solve my problem  .
i soldered the springs together several times subsequently , i is hiking down from the summit of mount harvard in a rainstorm  .
my garmin etrex became a rain guage  .
garmin charged me $120 to replace the water    logged unit  .
the first hike with the replacement unit indicated that i hiked to 24 , 800 feet , an impossibility unless i had oxygen tanks and floated on 10 , 000 feet of air garmin cannot be read in the dark , which is the only time when i have been close to being lost on a hike near mirror lake in the eagles nest wilderness area  .
garmin etrex did not track satellites in lodgepole forest  .
this year , i bought the magellan explorist xl  .
magellan is the gps that i should have purchased the first time around  .
i can easily read the large letters on the large color screen , even in the dark  .
the construction is far more solid than the garmin and has double the battery capacity , which enables me to hike multiple days without gps failures .
