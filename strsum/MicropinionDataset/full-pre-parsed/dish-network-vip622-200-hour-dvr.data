this is a great dvr  .

ignore the naysayers about heat issues , etc  .

i'm a ee and this thing is solid  .

out of all the dvrs i've looked at , this is head and shoulders above the rest .

dish is coming out with more hd programming so the shows and picture quality are getting better  .

this receiver keeps getting better year by year when they upgrade the software (done automatically) and add or update the features  .

web based timers side by side pip .

i agree with most of what is said in the above review except there is a use for the ethernet port now  .

dish recently enabled dish online (ip    vod) where you can connect either by ethernet or by homeplug and download movies through your broadband connection  .

homeplug   the receiver decodes ethernet signals from the power plug  .

cnet , please update your review  .

very user friendly  .

best hd dvr around and i have tried them all  .

tivo is ok , but its a rip off $499  .

95 for the box and $19  .

95/mo  .

are they kidding  .

directv hd dvr is garbage  .

locks up all the time  .

and it costs $199  .

95 after rebate  .

this is a great product  .

i have used directv's tivo for years now and i would say that this is as good  .

but keep in mind directv does not use tivo any more  .

so i can not compare this to directv's own dvr  .

as far as comparing to tivo i would give them equal scores  .

i tried dishnetwork about 3 years ago and hated thier equip  .

no dual tuner  .

now with this new baby with the 320gb hard drive , i do not regret the change  .

most will say i do not like the guide blah , blah , blah , blah  .

i am completey satisfied with my new 622 reciever and will not look back  .

i do not have any prob with directv but this is definitely a great move as far as i am concerned  .

directv has finally met its match  .

i cannot believe i am actually saying that  .

but it is true  .

great product dish  .

directv get off your high horse and try to focus on the most important thing , your customers  .

read reviews on the new directv hd dvr's and see for yourself  .

dish hands down  .

this is an awesome dvr  .

my 42 hd channels through dish network are picture perfect on my sony sxrd 60 inch television  .

i have friends that have comcast hd dvr's and are disgustingly disturbed at the difference between the two many different connections remotes behave well  .

multiple recordings while watching a channel at the same time  .

usb port in the front  .

super fast reaction time on actions .

this is the best hd    dvr you could possibly hope for  .

dish network is the absolute best tv provider , cable , satellite or otherwise , in the usa  .

the installation upgrade from my old dish network equipment is seamless and professionally done , the receiver works without any issues  .

you do get the occasional brief loss of audio and pixellation in the picture , but it only lasts for a second or so , and that's only because there are a few trees around my home  .

i wish the second tv that can be hooked up to the receiver is also in hd , but oh well  .

people who complain about dish network , i've found , tend to have either committed user error , or they just didn't bother to read the terms of service (which means they did not send in their redemption forms)  .

their customer service and tech support is top notch  .

they're really correct when they say it's better tv  .

i'd never use anything else .

great reciever  .

i have historically been a providers nightmare as i have tended to churn  .

got directv at its inception  .

have flipped to dish and cable a few times  .

unless you are passionate about nfl football , dish is clearly superior by a lot  .

this receiver is much better than previous dish receivers i have had including an original hdtv 9000 .

i have a 50 industrial panasonic hd monitor and yamaha av receiver in family room and 3 crt tvs in bedrooms  .

all work perfectly  .

my hd video is fantastic  .

my 5  .

1 sound is wonderful  .

i get surround sound from remote tvs by connecting avrs with rca outlets from remote tvs  .

love the 30sec advance and 10sec reverse to skip commercials  .

the search options are far superior to the old dish dvrs  .

its zapper also has functional control of my tv , dvd , and avr  .

this dvr offers everything i can currently imagine a dvr should deliver .

cannot live with out it  .

look i resisted getting a dish for the longest time because of that big dumb looking dish and i is quite happy with my local cable company  .

but when i had to down size my financial empire i is blown away at the price and quality of content you get from dish networks turbohd over the basic hd cable package  .

i do not need to have 150 channels , i only ever watched 5 or 6 consistently , now the ability to order movies and ppv events in 1080p for half the price of cable i can live with the dish   )  .

best dvr ever  .

fast , reliable , and has many options like pip , autotune , and reminder settings , plus can add exturnal harddrive for more hd recording space  .

4 custom favorite settings for each room  .

does 2 rooms dvr 1 hd 1 sd  .

1 wire solution  .

dishnetwork clearly the hd dvr leader .

we've been on dish for about 10 years now  .

our first dvr (low res) is still in use after 5 years  .

the vip622 is a rock solid unit that we have had no problems with hooked up to a sony bravda 4 , danon receiver (5+1 channel) using a harmony remote  .

it is super easy to set to record a whole series or a single show  .

my daughter recorded so you think you can dance and has watched it a million times this summer  .

make sure you have good ventilation for if you cook (overheat) the chips , the unit will become unstable (no different than any other pc)  .

just too small of a disk drive for all the stuff on the olympics i'd like to record .

i have been using the vip622 since september of 2007  .

this dvr has worked exeptionally well  .

i enjoy that i is able to easily take my off    air hd local channels and directly run them into the back of the receiver  .

this is a great feature that allows me to then use the recording capabilities of the dvr for the local channels  .

very impresive to friends when watching nfl football games etc another feature that is easy to use and offers a lot of value to the average television and movie addict is the recording features  .

i can quickly search for shows and movies etc , that i want to watch and then i am able to set timers on those shows and movies  .

much simpler to use then the counterparts tivo directv  .

being able to use this one reciever to control two televisions and not interfere with the other person watching is simply the most amazing part of this dvr i have had no physical problems with this device and i have not had to reboot it .

i've had the vip 622 for a little over a year now with no problems and no complaints i first hooked up a 500gb external hard drive to save movies from the many channels in hd then discovered i could order pay per view of new releases and save them also in hd  .

most movies i've recorded come in at about 6  .

5gb but with some as high as 11gb i could have never received the qualty of the movie on a dvd even duel    layered disc as i get with the one's i've saved to hard drive the only drawback is when you hook the hard drive up to the vip622 it will format it in a way that a computer will not recognize it in case i wanted to burn a dvd of a show i'm very happy with my dishnetwork vip 622  .

review is right on  .

i have had no heat issues and have used the dvr for over six months  .

the ethernet port has been activated by dish and can be used instead of phone line  .

i have a router powered by a sprint aircard cabled in and able to order pay    per    view w/ the remote as well as download 100's of older movies if desired .

i recently upgraded to this receiver from dish's older dual dvr receiver combo ; and previously had directtv systems  .

by far , this is the best system i have used or seen elsewhere  .

i am not a dish enthusiate entirely , but i do love this receiver  .

the hd picture quality is really stunning (i just got a new 1080 hd tv) , and it is so easy to use  .

i honestly enjoy using this machine and i cannot say that about many tech devices  .

while i have had it 3 months , i have not seen any particular issues , other than normal sattelite problems  .

i love the fact that you can do picture in picture with the dual receivers , and even have a side    by    side with two shows (great for watching two football games) , which is great on a hd tv (wide perspective)  .

the menus and recording features are simple and do the job well  .

the interactive menu for weather (with satellite) , news , and other stuff is great , along with watching six screens at once  .

i cannot say enough good things about this device .

longtime tivo user the first few days were very frustrating now , especially with updates , love the satellite dvr lots of ads , not truly obscene but kinda of irritating  .

i mean i'm already paying for subscription , already renting dvr i really do not need any ads still , overall , th best dvr i've ever used in 9 years  .

one word       awesome  .

good job dish  .

i've owned a tivo and a previous generation dish hd dvr  .

this device is a pleasure to own and does more than i can believe  .

picture quality and versitility is stellar  .

sortage and retrieval of programming is smooth  .

support for 2 rooms of tv is awesome  .

search and auto    record features are plentiful  .

surprisingly (for me) i cannot think of any legitimate complaints  .

(ok it runs hot but they all do keep it ventalated)  .

great product    has worked seamlessly for over one year , with constant firmware updates in the middle of the night  .

wish the second tv would receive hd , and over the air transmissions  .

love the external hard drive option and computer hook    up  .

picture is outstanding , as is sound through optical output .

we have been echostar (dish network's parent company) satellite tv service customers since 1988  .

the company tries to provide , and generally succeeds in providing , adequate , competitive service  .

based on our own experience when we had two home and on the experience of friends and family , dish network's service is on a par with , if not better than , cable service and directtv  .

keep in mind for any of them   sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't  .

with that said , we did not leap into dish hd even though we've had a 42 inch hd plasma tv since 2003  .

the reason is simple , we live in the redwoods and most of the initial dish hd signals were on satellites we cannot see  .

(the satellite companies are clear    lacking an unobstructed southern sky view can be a problem for service , a problem not found in cable service  .

) we still cannot get some of the hd service we theoretically are paying for because of this  .

but almost every hd feed we'd like to see we now can  .

(we also waited a few months for the release of the vip722 because it is black as are the other components in our home theater system  .

since we were adding to our dish network standard definition service (keeping our existing two receiver/recorders active) , we knew what we were getting into  .

if you are new to satellite tv browse the links at http  //www  .

dbstalk  .

com/ and particularly the dish network info at http  //ekb  .

dbstalk  .

com/  .

things went pretty much as expected  .

we called the dish network number and explained we wanted to add an hd 722 receiver/recorder to our existing two feeds    four feeds total  .

the woman took the order without needing alot of explanation and but she gave an incorrect price which she couldn't get straight , but oh well three days later two installers wearing shirts with the dish logo arrived in a old , but well maintained , unmarked pickup  .

one spoke only spanish , but the other who is the lead is fluently bilingual  .

(my spanish is comparable to george bush's so i speak english but listen carefully  .

) the lead installer discussed his flawed work order with me , called his supervisor to get permission to do what we had ordered  .

installation went well  .

but , you need to know that we had the cables to our theater system hooked up with the end plugs for the vip722 waiting on the shelf for the installer to plug in  .

he will likely not have with him more than rca's for composite video and two channel sound and an s    video cable  .

we have hd component connections and an optical surround sound connector to our theater system , plus an s    video and rca stereo to our additional room distribution box  .

he activated the system which resulted in most signals being activated before he left , but some (local channels for instance) took another three hours  .

(we knew this would happen from previous experiences with changing our programming  .

even though we had prevous service with older (508) recorders , the menu's for the 722 are complex and require some deciphering , the adequate operating manual notwithstanding  .

for us , the dish tech portal at http  //tech  .

dishnetwork  .

com/departmental_content/techportal/content/tech/receiver/722  .

shtml is very helpful  .

nonetheless , after about two weeks of setting it up like we want it , the hd picture and 5  .

1 sound is as good as our dvd player provides (no we don't have brand new hd or bluray) and certainly as good as we are ever going to be able to appreciate for us , several consideration were involved  .

even though we did not have cable service available when we first moved here , we now have comcast which is our high speed internet service provider  .

we had comcast in our other home and two of our adult kids have comcast  .

we have no problem with comcast but it would be more expensive and they are just now upgrading to be able to offer hd  .

we could have gotten a huge new customer discount from directtv , but directtv's packages are not what we want (we are not big sports enthusiasts)  .

additionally , no other service has provided the state    of    the    art recording technology as reliablly as dish  .

some people prefer tivo , but that appears to be a personal preference  .

we do have rare weather related signal losses  .

but our cable system goes down more frequently and in a power outage it simply goes down , while our battery backup lasts long enough for us to start up our generator  .

in a two or three day power outage which does occur every four or five years , this is a big plus .

great product  .

dns customer service is in foreign countries  .

i am not racist however , i am very hesitant to pass credit card info to someone in a foreign country not falling under us business laws  .

plus i dont want to patronize companies for this anti    us behavior  .

but the other cable and big satellite providers engage in the same practices so it all comes down to whom offers the best bang for my buck  .

dn bar none wins for me with the vip 622  .

my dvr gets very heavy use    i'm extremely happy with the product  .

the hd picture quality is excellent  .

i found the menus very easy to navigate  .

the program info is very complete and rarely incorrect  .

setting up timers and checking possible conflicts is a snap  .

the 'skip commercials' button works great  .

maybe i got a later bios update , but i have had no malfunctions or problems in 11 months  .

my only concern is that if the dish gets hit with lightning or has other problems , i will pay for the repairs  .

unlike the cable company , they do not replace them for free  .

but , check your contract to be sure  .

the other problem is with reception    this is not a problem with the dvr per se , but buyers should check with neighbors for bad weather outage possibilities .

it's easier to use than the comcast digital cable and ondemand box that i upgraded from  .

the multiroom feature is out of this world  .

when no one is in the other room i toggle the box to single mode to use the spiffy pip function  .

i've never tivo'd or dvr'd until i got dish so i cannot speak on its ease of use comparatively , i just know that i picked up on it the day the installer gave us a brief run    through  .

i've had it for about two months now and i love it and have absolutely no real complaints about how it works , just features that i wish i had .

this is a superb product  .

i have had it for about three weeks , and i absolutely love it  .

i have the hdmi cable hooked up to my tv from the vip622 and i have excellent picture and sound  .

i went with this product because directv is just extremely too high in price , and dish has much better programming  .

dish also has more channels  .

directv also does not have a reciever that has dvr for two tv's and hd for one .

i owned the dish hd dvr 942 for over a year and never had any problems with it other than the occasional crash every month or two  .

i have had this same problem with tivos and every other dvr that i have owned 622 installed easily with no connection problems , a picture is excellent and i have nothing to complain about  .

i is a little bit nervous about buying it from reading the reviews here , but it is basically a free from dish with the rebates that they gave you  .

there is $100 rebate when you send back in your old 942 , and another $10 a month off your bill for year , which basically negates the $200 price you pay the only slight negative is that there is occasional picture pixelization  .

what i mean by this is that occasionally the hd picture will break up into pixels for maybe one to two seconds before will return to normal  .

this might happen once every 10 hours of viewing time  .

you still get the sound while this is happening , so it's not really an issue at all to me  .

i guess if you're going to record the hd content on hd dvr , then this contest could conceivably be a problem for you dish network let me keep the old 942 for as long as i wanted so if i had a problems with the 622 i could just keep the 942 and return 622  .

but i've not had any problems with the 622 and the local picture is excellent the only other binary issue is that i wish the hard drive is bigger , or if you remember the tivo hack you could do , where you can install additional hard drive on your own and get double the recording time  .

so you have to be a little bit careful on what high definition shows you record because otherwise you'll quickly surpass the limit of the 30 hours of high    definition recording time incidentally this review is recorded using dragon naturallyspeaking version 9 , with no word corrections , other than the words that i spoke wrong to begin with , so that i is basically correcting myself , but the software did not miss recognize any words  .

it is recorded using a toshiba laptop with a 1  .

7 pentium m  .

processor and 1 gb of memory for anyone who is not typed at 50 words a minute or more easily and effortlessly , dragon naturallyspeaking 9 is must    have software .

i read some of the other negative reviews , i've had a great experience with this receiver and i would recommend it to anyone looking for the top of the line performance  .

i switched to dish network after the cable company jacked my price up  .

i had the motorola 6412 with cable  .

the vip622 blows the 6412 out of the water  .

there's no comparison to the hd quality , responsiveness of the box  .

hdmi connection worked fine  .

the voom network hd channels are great  .

one thing i would suggest is that your home needs to be wired correctly for this type of receiver if you want it to be the only receiver in your home  .

you need a back feed to your home cable box so that you can control a second tv with the box .

i have been a dish customer since 1998 with the same receiver  .

purchased new hdtv and upgrade to this unit with hd programming  .

i am amazed  .

this unit brings in my local hd and dish programming superbly  .

never had any problem with this unit at all  .

i run hdmi to my tv and optical sound out to my a/v unit for a great theater experience .

the fact that it has pip and that you can record 2 shows at the same time while watchng another is worth the price  .

you can also switch from one pip to another and rewind on both  .

hd looks good but the hdmi out from the receiver is very delicate  .

i am currently on my 2nd receiver because the hdmi just decided to quit  .

dish claims it it a software issue but they have not fixed it yet  .

other owners say it is a bad solder  .

i'm on my 2nd vip 622 and all is well so far  .

dish says if it goes out again they will not send me another one  .

that's not going to happen  .

they will send me another one  .

i still give it a user rating of 9  .

we've had tivo for a few years and loved it but when they finally came out with a hd tivo they made it only for cable customers  .

we switched to the dish hd dvr and are very pleased  .

in some ways tivo is better (like the 'deleted items' folder and ease of setting up season passes) but are finding our way around the dish box with little trouble and the picture quality is great  .

it has it's little quirks but so did tivo (tivo sometimes froze up and had to be unplugged and started again , and periodic problems with audio distortion , etc)  .

nothing is perfect in this world  .

we're happy .

hello dish  goodbye cable  .

dish rocks and the vip622 and vip211 receivers are great as well  .

i really liked my cable company , but for several years of trying to get them to add at least one german channel for my wife , i finally gave up and switched to dish  .

i wanted to switch to directv because i is an engineer at hughes space and communications when directv is being developed , plus i own a fair amount of dtv stock , but they had no where near the foreign language channels that dish had and no german  .

i is worried about getting the vip622 and vip211 because of all the negative comments on this forum and after reading somewhere that people in california had lousy reception on the voom hd channels because of the bad look angle to an eastern satellite after digesting all the negative comments and noting that the cnet reviewer had a high rating for the vip622 , i decided to roll the dice and go for it  .

because of the problems people were having , i decided to take the package that commits you to 18 months , but gives you a one month trial period  .

after a few weeks , i have no intention of ever switching away from dish  .

i signed up for the hd platinum package along with the southern california local channels (which includes prime sports) and the german channels  .

now i have 31 hd channels (including the nfl network in hd) and even a free french channel (not hd) because of all the channels i wanted , the installer put up a dish1000 antenna , which is a single dish that has four feed horns to support the four satellites i needed  .

the vip622 supports two tvs  a 50 inch plasma hdtv and an lcd standard definition (sd) tv downstairs in my wifes office  .

the vip622 is connected to the wall mounted plasma tv via a 25 foot hdmi that goes through walls by way of the attic (dont buy hdmi cables at stores  they are much cheaper on the internet)  .

the hd picture is 1080i and awesome  .

the sd tv gets its signal through existing coax from the cable company , so i didnt have to add any coax through virtually impossible cable runs (the rf signal goes to the vip622 and back out for the second tv on the same coax line)  .

the quality of the sd is as good as sd can get  .

the remote for the second tv uses uhf rf instead of ir , so it works throughout the house    allowing me to place the second tv anywhere in the house the vip211 is in my home office  .

while i is waiting for santa to bring my lcd hdtv , i used it with a crt sd tv  .

the picture quality is very good  at least as good as the cable signal  .

now that the hdtv has arrived , the hdtv picture (1080i) via the 10 foot hdmi cable is awesome the vip622 has great sound output  .

it feeds my bose lifestyle 48 surround sound system and i guarantee that the theater experience has not been degraded with the vip622 the vip622 and vip211 both run cool  .

i dont know why some reviewers complained about thermal runaway , but both of my units are slightly warm to the touch  no where near as warm as the dvr i is using with my cable system  .

perhaps their units were enclosed in cabinets with no possible way for heat to escape  .

my units are in cabinets , but not sealed in with doors one last comment about the overall system  our digital cable system here in laguna beach had occasional drop    outs on some channels  .

so far , through two rain storms , there has not been the slightest degradation in the perfect signal quality on any channel at any time i cannot comment on dish customer service  .

i have not had a reason to call them .

so far i am totally pleased with the vip622  .

i just switched from a cable co  .

motorola dvr and i could not be happier  .

everthing about this box is better  .

i have only limited experience with tivo , but i think this box will stand up to most tivo functions and ease of use .

listen to cnet , not the peanut gallery here  .

i had tivo from the bloody beginning and directv's version for years  .

this dvr makes tivo look like a joke  .

especially if you have suffered all the indignities of tivo , this is a get out of jail free card  .

the review is right on in almost every aspect  .

people rave about the tivo remote  .

this one is more complicated , but it's 10x better  .

took my girlfriend some time to get up to speed , but it is well worth it also , if you consider velocity , it's a hands down winner  .

we got 0 upgrades from tivo during the 5 year directv stint  .

dish has consistently improved their offering , and left the door open to seriously blowing this thing away  .

if they enable the networking , and allow the attachment of a drive array , this would be a perfect setup .

this thing is awesome  .

my family is hooked on dvrs (from the sd dish version) , and found the hd version an easy upgrade we have not had stability problems others reported  .

don't get me wrong , it's not 100% perfect , but it's pretty darn close  .

i do not know why anyone would pay the $700 tivo is asking for .

this is a fantastic component with glitches if dish can ever get a strong consistant signal to the west coast from sat 129 (all voom and starz)  .

receiver often gets blame for poor sat performance  .

110 and 119 transponders perform very well  .

if you live on west coast do not count on 129 channels apparently gyros not working on sat and it drifts out about every 20    30 minutes and then takes 5 minutes to come back in  .

when , if dish replaces or fixes 129 this receiver will be ready to function at a very high level  .

picture excellent on strong sats  .

locals , hbo , showtime , and othe hdtv come in solid i wish there is a way to add external or larger internal hdd so i could record and save even more hdtv shows  .

as number of hdtv channel increase (please  .

)more tuners would be nice  .

for now the 622 is as good as it gets and that is very good indeed  .

most enjoyable  .

very glad i upgraded .

i've owned sd tivo machines in the past , and i've even owned one of dish's other hd dvrs (the 942)  .

the dish vip622 has all of the features of a tivo but best of all dish network has more hd content than anyone else  .

and let's face it , what good is an hd    dvr with hd content to record on it i have not had any issues with my vip622 receiver since i received it in april of 2006  .

the machine has performed flawlessly for me  .

the picture it produces is stunning , and despite the recent negative campaigns of the cable companies against dish systems , i have never lost my sat signal during a rain or snow storm i love hdtv i love this receiver i love my dish network service  .

it's not just better tv  .

it's the best tv  .

while the first versions of the firmware were a littly flakey , the 622 has become a solid machine  .

the menus are easy to navigate and responsive to the keys on the remote control  .

it can record three hd streams at once (2 from the sattelite , one from ota)  .

the software is intuitive and easy to use my only complaint is that the hdmi connector is sometimes a little twitchy  .

because of this , i am currently using the composite connection to my television .

i bought this dvr in may  .

it has performed as i expected and better  .

it has multiple hookups    hdmi is preferred here , but component hookup is almost as good  .

recordings in hd are terrific  .

only problem encountered so far is occasional sound and lip movement do not match  .

this can be fixed easily by pressing your input button on the tv remote and cycling through the choices until you get back to the input you want  .

i do not know why , but this works for me  .

other than that , i would have rated this a ten  .

oh , by the way , i have not had any overheating issues with my dvr as others have and i have 2 hd tv's hooked up  .

again , i do not know why , but i am grateful .

i had been using an older directv system for the last eight years  .

when i wanted to upgrade directv wanted me to pay several hundred dollars for a dvr and several hundred more for one with hd , plus shipping  .

i said no  .

i called dish network and ordered the 622 for a lease fee of $200  .

00 this is a outstanding system  .

i is surprised how superior the video and sound were in both hd and sd  .

plus local channels that i received off an my rooftop antenna came in better too  .

also , recording two shows at once is great and all the menus are cool and easy to use  .

plus the remote works great , works with my other units and makes channel surfing easy  .

also , this has a dual turner , so it can be used for two tvs (one hd and one sd )  .

this saves you from paying an extra $5  .

00 per month lease fee  .

however , if you have a rooftop antenna and do not order dish network local channels , then you will not be able to see what's on locally using this units tv menu guide  .

also , like others said , this unit does get hot  .

i have my inside of a cabinet too  .

i solved this problem by using a pc whisper fan and placed it next to the unit  .

i powered it using a 12v d  .

adaptor  .

it has never overheated , even after over 12 hours of on time  .

the cabinet already had vents in it after i cancelled directv , they called two days later  .

they said they wanted me back and would now offer me thier equipment for free  .

too late  .

i almost never submit online product reviews , but this product is so exceptional that i can honestly say it is one of the best pieces of electronic equipment i've ever owned considering that i've got about a $10k investment in a/v equipment , i think that's really saying something  .

here's some comments i have    .

1) this is my first foray into hdtv (first time i've had an hd feed , even though i've had a sony xbr 40 , 4  3 aspect ratio tube tv that supports hd for about 4 years now) , and the hd picture quality is great not perfect , but definitely worth the upgrade  .

although the detail varies a bit with the feed , the average hd picture quality is very nice  .

sports , movies , everything i've watched in hd has been very pleasing  .

the sd on this set also looks very good , but you'll find that if you watch hd programming regularly , you won't like going back to sd you get so used to the detail hd provides that it kinda sucks going back to sd  .

the only real knock on the combination of this receiver with my tv is that there's a bit of flicker on text , and occasional artifacts on some solid colors , particularly reds i'm a bit picky about stuff like this , whereas my wife doesn't really notice it  .

i'm running the box in 1080i mode , and maybe this would be improved with 720p , but my tv doesn't seem to like it when i switch to that mode i guess the tv only supports 1080i for hd via its component input  .

2) the dvr functionality is absolutely magnificient , from the simplicity in setting up recordings , to the hd playback capabilities (which look spot    on like the originals) , to the pause/rewind live tv  .

the recording space is reasonable , except that if you do a lot of hd recording (where my main interests seem to lie) , it can fill up surprisingly quickly for example , being a big soccer fan , i got this stuff all setup just as the world cup is starting , and is regularly recording hd feeds of two games per day  .

with the added    on time to make sure the entire games were recorded , i got close to running out of space before i had viewed the games  .

this is the only issue that keeps me from giving this a perfect 10 rating  .

another neat feature is the ability to select which tuner is used for the dvr , so that you can watch/record a program on your main tv , while recording another program using second tuner (although the second tv is restricted to use that channel then) may seem overkill to some folks , but it's come in handy a few times  .

3) the menuing system is the most perfectly designed system i've experienced on an electronic product  .

it's extremely user    friendly , and has lots of neat features that just make sense , such as being able to scroll through the channel menus while watching the last channel is a 1/4 sized screen on the top right , and allowing you to scroll through the menu of channels one at a time while the currently selected channel takes up the entire screen  .

very , very neat  .

also , the speed on scrolling through the menus is exceptionally fast none of this delay nonsense that used to happen with older cable and dish receivers  .

there's also almost no lag when you do select a channel  .

the speed of operation of this box suggests that the processing hardware they used to build it is well above average  .

for folks that do a lot of channel surfing like me , this is a huge benefit  .

4) the extra tuner provided for a second tv (and i suppose a third , if you need the over    the    air tuner to get some hdtv channels that you cannot get through dish) is an awesome feature for a home that has one very high    quality hdtv , and a second sdtv (maybe in a small bedroom , like ours is)  .

our home previously had just a cheapo antenna on our bedroom tv , and going to this is a huge upgrade , without having to pay a second box fee per month  .

the rf remote is occasionally a bit flakey , but it mostly works ok  .

5) my setup is probably a bit unusual for this box , but as i'm a techie    tweaker , i found the following setup to give me the most flexibility  .

one drawback to using this box with a 4  3 aspect ratio hdtv (the older models available 5 years ago or so) is it's inability to show all programs in native format automatically in other words , for the 16  9 hdtv feeds , i want the aspect ratio to appear 16  9 with blank bands on the top and bottom of the screen , and similarly , for the 4  3 sdtv feeds , i want the picture to take up the entire 4  3 screen , instead of putting black bands on all four sides of the picture  .

if you don't mind manipulating the stretch feature everytime you switch between sd and hd channels , this works fine  .

my preferred approach instead , is to use multiple tv inputs , and toggle between the two using the tv/video button on my tv's remote  .

i used two sets of the receiver's main tuner outputs , the component output for the hd feed , and the s    video output for the sd feed the s    video output is really pretty adequate for sd anyways  .

the hd feed via component cabling is always set to normal 16  9 mode , while the sd feed via s    video cabling is always set to stretch the 4  3 output to fill up the screen  .

the installer (while very good otherwise) is not able to figure this out , and it took me a while playing around with this stuff to get it to work as desired  .

it would've been nice if the box automatically interpreted the feed's aspect ratios correctly , but it doesn't on my tv , regardless of how i setup the aspect ratios in the hdtv setup menu  .

this approach allowed me to watch all programs in their native aspect ratios , while taking advantage of the full 4  3 screen size for sd programming too often i've seen pictures that look warped/stretched incorrectly because the installers or users haven't taken the time to get the aspect ratio settings correct , and this just wouldn't have passed for my setup  .

admittedly , most of you considering this box will have 16  9 hdtvs , and so none of this will pertain to you , as you'll watch 16  9 feeds at their native aspect ratio , and 4  3 feeds will have black bars on the left and right sides (unless you choose to stretch them to take up the entire 16  9 box , which just looks bad to me) the second tv is connected via rg    6 coax , which for this low    end tv is adequate  .

i also have an sd output from the second tuner (using the rca connector) going to my main hdtv , so that i can monitor what's being watched on the second tv in the bedroom  .

this is a neat feature for keeping an eye on what your kids are watching  .

this would also allow you to use pip using the tv's capabilities , rather than the receiver's single/dual tuner mode/pip  .

the drawback to this is that you need to have both remotes in front of you to actually use pip this way , while the dish receiver can do everything with the main remote only 6) minor bugs i've experienced so far in about 6 weeks of operation   one lockup on the main tuner (which did not affect the second tuner for some reason) , which required a manual reset to recover from ; occasional 'stuttering' of the picture (maybe once or twice a week) which happens for about 30 seconds , and then goes away ; mismatched audio feed on the local hdtv channels in the chicago area i'm only seeing this issue on those channels which apparently use the mpeg    4 compression , so i cannot be sure whether this is an issue with the mpeg decoder or the feeds themselves ; box runs warm , but not hot to the touch i would not install this is a cabinet , but in an open air rack with plenty of airflow available to it 7) lastly , the manual is very well written , as least as far as i've gotten through it (about 1/2 way)  .

i tend to try things out in the menus myself first , and then go back to reading manuals to see if there's anything i missed later on  .

this one seems very well put together , by someone who's actually spent some time with the box overall , a superb product that i highly recommend  .

been with dish for years as an owner of a 501/508 and 811 and the 622 is , by far , the very best  .

is able to wire my entire house with one box  .

one high def set and the rest of the house on the sd conversion  .

let me tell you the standard def output is not really that bad  .

in fact , this is a huge bonus as you get dvd quality from the high def stations on even old tv sets the only thing i wish dish would stop is this insane pre    recorded pay per view  .

instead of offering pay per view every 15    30 minutes if you want , they pre    download a handfull of shows in    case you want to want them and cannot wait 15    30 mins for the show to start via the old way  .

this means that in the middle of the night they are downloading movies that 99% will never watch taking up space on the hard drive (this is extra space that does not take away from your portion)    just seems like a total waste i have had the 622 for a few months and it is rock stable  .

everything works great and i would recommend the 622 to anyone as a side note  .

unless your second tv is really cose to the first one you will be using coax (cable type wiring) to connect a second , 3rd or 4th tv's    keep in mind that this is not as good as using s    video or other higher quality connections but considering extra tv's are often 50    100 feet away in your house their is little options  .

for coax it looks pretty good but the prime connection will always be the tv next to the box so plan where you will be putting the box carefully .

now that the bugs seem to be fixed there is very little to complain about  .

the keyword search stops the blocks the image on screen but does not stop the playing of the system at the same time  .

it should be made so that the image remains on screen while one searchs for another program etc .

overall , this is a very nice hd dual tuner  .

in all this could be three tuners , 2 satellite and 1 ota  .

the 942 is the previous version and this unit is pretty much the same  .

it is mpeg    4 ready so you are up with the latest technology  .

the interface is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it  .

cannot be confusing at first to try and find your dvr recordings and to work the pip option  .

the unit does freeze up and has some gliches that require a reboot  .

this happens rarely though  .

but when it does , you wo not be too happy , especially if you are in the middle of watching a program because it will take several mintues for the system to come back up  .

lots of options for audio and video connections on the back  .

the best dvr on the market right now  .

blow dtv's options out of the water as far as price and technology .

the vip622 is worth your money or lease  .

super fast speed when changing channels , dual tuner , pip , etc , etc  .

honestly i love this dvr , the only draw back is that you cannot connect any other inputs like a camcorder , etc  .

you cannot stream , move or copy recording to your pc either  .

other then those minor issues this dvr will enhance your dish experience .

this is a great box  .

i've had an hd    ready tv for 2 years waiting for this mpeg4 , hd dvr , and it's been worth the wait  .

i have had no restarts , no lip    synch problems , and since i almost never watch anything live , i only encountered the video stutter once , which is easily fixed as described above  .

my area has no hd locals through dish network , and i can get only pbs and abc ota in hd  .

i have not encountered any problems in recording these two local stations using the ota tuner i have read about the problems listed in the review , but i've not had them  .

i record at least 2    4 programs each day , and some evenings many more my pocketdish syncs up nicely via usb and is a great way to play programs downloaded from my 622 , play music , view photos , or play games  .

it's a great companion to the 622  .

we watch only recorded shows , thus dvr is essential  .

we have had the 622 since acquiring our first hd set about two years ago  .

prior to that we had standard def two    tv dvr from dish , and before that a single set dvr , with second set operating only with real time receiver from dish  .

the ability to program the recorder from either tv at opposite ends of the house , knowing we can eventually choose to watch the show from either end of the house , is now essential  .

it is my non    techie understanding that this feature is not available from competitors  .

we cannot fathom stepping back to the day of setting a recording from the family room , and a week later settling in the bedroom to watch that recording only to realize it is recorded on the other machine , and is unavailable  .

so kudos to this system for that  .

on the other hand , since hd has been the standard format for several years now , i am puzzled that apparently even the updated 722 will not allow one to watch a recording in hd format on either tv  .

so though i intend to buy a second and bigger hd set , i will apparently have to demote the smaller set to actually only watching standard def  .

am i missing something  .

direct tv has told me that they cannot even supply me with an hd dvr that will operate two sets , even with one a standard def set  .

dish can supply me for more money with two hd dvr's , but they will work independently , a non    starter for us per the above note love the 30 second instant jump forward , variable speed forward or reverse scan , all of which i assume competitors have  .

have never used tivo , so no doubt i am missing something heretofore unessential to me  .

am concerned that if i upgrade to 722 , that i may get a lemon , considering all negative remarks on these reviews  .

though it would be nice to have more recording space , especially when more hd programming comes my way (live rurally , where comcast unavailable) , so far we figure if we haven't watched a program by the time the space is gone , we must not really want to watch it  .

we do not watch movies more than once , so no need to save watched shows  .

do , however find that sometimes we record from sd version of program to save space .

i can record two different shows at the same time  .

or , i can use the dish picture in picture using this 622 receiver  .

the menu system is a little tricky to learn    but seems to be occasionally updated  .

we've had ours for at least two years (maybe more) and will never be without an hd dvr again  .

it instantly relegated my dvd recorder to the guest bedroom  .

have no experience with tivo or any other dvr ; i am thrilled with this one by dish .

i am unhappy because they said i would have to keep the 622 and let them continue to try to fix the software problems or pay $75 for them to replace it with a 722 and extend my contract  .

this is the first big problem they have not resolved but since they know it is their problem i am very disappointed they tried to hit me up for $75 after 10 phone calls totaling approximately 11 hours  .

i am also unhappy because my neighbor said direct tv customer service is really lousy  .

( his opinion ) .

i've had this product for over a year now with barely any issues at all  .

i came to dish from twc's hddvr service , and this is a much better experience  .

i have no exp  .

with tivo so i cannot compare it to that i do run out of hd space alot , but dish is the only company that allows you to add an external hd , so you essentially have unlimited space and could actually create an hd library of shows  .

the cost of turning on the front usb port is a one time fee then you have unlimited recording the dvr interface is somewhat cumbersome with my biggest complaint being that i cannot sort by date with the oldest on top  .

the dvr deletes the oldest first , so i try to watch them first , but it's really annoying to have to scroll all the way to the bottom when you have 100 shows saved  .

also , if you delete the show you're watching from the popup box at the end of the recording , it puts you back at the top of the list , so , here we go a    scrolling again  .

it does have a page down button to speed up the process , but the buttons on the remote aren't easy to get to as someone else stated , the unit does get very hot  .

i do have mine in an enclosure with another shelf right above it and it gets hot enough were you cannot hold your hand on it  .

however , it's never shut down on me because of heat and the unit almost never crashes  .

the heat probably diminishes the life span of the unit i'm sure as electronics aren't generally designed to withstand this kind of heat one thing the review is incorrect about (at least in my area of the country) is the ethernet not working  .

i've had mine hooked up to my home network for a while (just plugged it in to my old xbox wireless box and it found the network and connected by itself even though i have my security settings on , must have recognized it as the xbox)  .

you can download (stream) sd movies on demand , for a fee of course  .

i personally have not tried it as i have a netflix account , so i cannot review it  .

hopefully cnet can get their's to work and will test it and add it to the review  .

if they upgrade the content to include hd , i would most definately use it overall i am very happy with this box and it's way better than the one the cable company gave me  .

plus , with the sd output , my daughter can watch tv upstairs without us having to purchase a second box and pay a monthly fee for the second box .

overall good product       no major problems except hard drive size , and we use it to death  .

this is the best receiver dish has offered and i have had 5 different ones  .

they have finally fixed some of their previous flaws  .

from the 721 and 921  .

while i have had some bad pixilization issues this is most likely b/c of a bad satellite signal  .

i do wish i could run coaxial and hdmi at the same time so i use my tv's pip  .

dish also had a great hd package with a lot of channels that are not available with other providers .

i is one of the first people to get this box when dish released the box  .

at first there were issues with the dvr only recording one channel at a time  .

they have since upgraded the code to make the dvr smart  .

it can now determine a overlap in recording and switch which tv is available for recording  .

the local hd channels are either in hd or letterbox  .

my second tv is a standard def 4x3 and the locals show up in letterbox with a smaller footprint    less viewing area overall    i have been very happy with this box since the fixed the dvr code  .

my only complaint is the standard dish issue    everynight when the box checks for new code the system is always set back to the dish logo and you must press the select button to watch any show  .

they need to make the system just go back to the last channel watched .

having being a dishnet customer for over 7 years i decided to take a break and went with comcast for cpl of months had two many problems with the motorola box give credit to comcast customer service for making available a replacement of box  .

in fact they deliver the unit  .

decided to switch back to dish and paid $ 199  .

00 for the new unit and dish 1000 antenna extremly satisfied with the unit .

installation took a while as we needed to keep the 61  .

5 dish as well as upgrade to the dish 1000  .

we had problems about ten years ago with the original dish player and had it replaced  .

the 622 also quit/died about 45 minutes after the installers left  .

tech support was not sure if it is the switch or the 622 that is the problem  .

i thought it is likely both  .

within a couple days replacements for both the switch and 622 arrived  .

the replacements have been working about two weeks    no nasty problems  .

i have needed to 'reboot' the 622 twice holding the unit's power button for about twelve seconds each time  .

the unit has worked fine otherwise  .

we have the full programing of dish/voom hd as well as the local hds of the detroit/flint/lansing areas  .

now if someone could explain why comcast and charter want us to ditch the dish for cable when they recieve just about everything from satellite themselves .

wow  .

my first dish dvr is the 921 (the grandfather of the new 622)  .

buggy and never fullfilled the advertised features my new 622 is stable and performs far better in nealry every way by comparison i liked the 622 that i've leased so much i have decided to purchase a second unit (with which i am equally as pleased) i have the secondary tv2 outputs , modulated into my home's antenna system and have picked up a couple additional remote controls  .

now any tv in the house can pause live tv while someone in another room can continue watching martha stewart  .

i highly recommend it  .

this will be a great box once they stabilize the code as a subscriber from the new york city dma , i can get the big 4 networks in hd  .

all but fox are great (the fox feed is full of audio drops that will have you climbing the walls and switching to sd mushyvision in frustration       at least in my area) large hard drive , can be hooked up to pocketdish , a psp looking portable player that can make your recordings portable  .

a usb port on the front makes a handy charger for you xbox 360 wireless controller users (it is always on as opposed to the 360 which kills power to the port when the unit is off) lightning fast guide scrolling (tivo users will get whiplash)  .

two satellite tuners plus an ota tuner for those within range of their local affiliates lets you laugh in the face of sadistic network programmers who decide to put all their best shows against each other (sunday 9pm anyone  .

) hdmi output or components , your choice both look good  .

can be set to output to 480i or p , 720p , or 1080i  .

if you have a dvi input only on your tv you will need an hdmi    dvi cable (only standard rca patch cords and a coaxial cable are supplied    no hd unless you spring for a cable)  .

if you want to reuse your eexisting dvi to dvi cable , you can buy an adapter to save you from having to drop another $100+ on a new cable all in all a good box  .

the score jumps to 9 if they ever get the code totally stable note   filmfest , a voom channel only available on dish has gotten the rights to most of the james bond films  .

mmmmm , bond in hd  .

this box is the only way you can record it (unless you use the non pvr mpeg 4 receiver from dish)  .

you cannot help compare this with tivo  .

i is a long    time customer of directv and when tivo came out for it , i is among first in line tivo is amazing and offered a lot of flexibility not found in this box  .

after directv forced me away from their tivo box (long , sad story) , i switched to dish network and got the vip622  .

it does have a lot of cool features i did not have in my old tivo box    like being able to still see video when in certain menu screens    but it also is too limiting in other regards  .

for example , with tivo , i is able to remove channels from a list so that if i recorded something , i could make it not record from a channel  .

what i mean is right now , for example , channel 417 (fsw) is offered in sd and hd modes  .

i record certain sports there and have the vip622 set up to record in hd when available , yet it always only records the sd mode  .

if i change the option to record only hd , then it records nothing at all  .

some kind of bug this is  .

in some months    with hd soon becoming mandatory    i'm hoping this will go away , but it is things such as this lack of ultimate flexibility that keeps the vip622 from being as good as tivo .

receiver does and excellent job on both sd and hd audio and video  .

optical to ss receiver works perfectly  .

video to sony xbr2  .

got unit in august 2006 as replacement for dish 942 mpeg2 dvr with hdmi that worked perfectly  .

only problem is hdmi dead out of box on new 622  .

still (12/16/2006) no fix  .

dish will replace but says there is still and unresolved problem with hdmi  .

only usable hd output is component video .

while this dvr offers the benefit of being able to watch recorded shows in another room too , it is way less friendly than directv's tivo in many respects  .

with dish's dvr , you cannot search for a specific actor and/or have those shows autorecord anytime that actor is found in the cast  .

when you set up a timer , you can request all episodes , new episodes , once , weekly , etc  .

if you choose all episodes , that is what you will get all episodes , with possibly many duplicates for shows that are in syndication  .

if you request new episodes , you get all of the current season's episodes again with duplication of shows possibly being broadcast several times during the week  .

tivo elimitates any show that you have already recorded in the last 21 days unless you specifically tell it to record duplicates there seems to be a fairly low limit on timers  .

when i had tivo , i would sit down once or twice a month and scan for movies and shows that i might like to watch and schedule them all at once    no limit  .

with dish dvr , i have to do this at least once a week and this is during summer when i do not have my timers dedicated to my favorite weekly shows i am looking forward to my commitment ending with dishnetwork so i can get back to real convenience with directv's tivo  .

i am quite pleased with this satellite hd receiver  .

it can control two sets independently  .

the 2nd set is only sdtv , not hd but it is good quality and it comes with a uhf remote so you can control it anywhere in the house  .

the primary hd output can be component , or hdmi  .

they both put out a great 1080i signal and also gives you the ability to take 480i signals and stretch/zoom them to fill a 16  9 widesecreen receiver  .

i generally do not like to do that because it distorts the picture in order to stretch it out , so i leave it set to native 4  3 with black sidebars for normal definition transmission  .

btw , there is such a big difference between a good hd signal and standard def that a standard definition (480i) signal looks pale in comparison  .

luckilly , more and more stations are converting to digital signals , so that in the next couple of years they will all be digital , and most of them (hopefully) will also be hd (720p or 1080 i/p) the menus and channel guide on this 4th generation dishnetwork receiver is great  .

i've seen channel guides from other companies including my local cable provider (comcast) , and i think that dishnetwork's is one of the best now for my gripe with this receiver   i have both cable  and  satellite (dishnetwork premium hd package)  .

my local cable provider has my local channels , as well as some pretty good digital hd channels to compliment my dishnetwork subscription  .

now , what i'm aggravated about is the fact that i cannot have the cable plugged into the dishnetwork vip622 receiver  .

it has an input for it mind you , it even has a setup menu screen to choose either external digital antenna (ala   atsc) or cable , and if you choose cable it gives you the option of selecting one of three different cable versions (standard , irc  .

and cannot remember the third type )  .

anyway , the menus on the vip622 do have instructions for connecting either an external antennae or a cable (straight cable or from a cable box)  .

the menus even have a setting to scan the channels  .

unfortunately , it doesnt work  .

there is no way to scan from a cable provider making this receiver totally useless if you happen to want to use another provider besides dishnetwork  .

since i am in a rural remote area that has no analog or digital over the air capability , i cannot confirm or deny that the receiver even will work with an outside antenna (analog or digital)  .

someone else will have to test this function , but i can tell you that it dont work with a standard cable provider  .

it simply cannot scan the cable channels  .

i have called dishnetwork's tech support about this issue  .

they acknowledge that this is a design flaw in this unit  .

they had intended it to be able to hookup cable into the vip622 and have the capability of switching inputs from either dishnetwork programming , over the air analog/digital programming or from a cable provider  .

somehow , this function didnt work and although they still have the physical hookups on the back , and the software menu items (not to mention instructions in their owners manual) , it wont accomodate cable inputs  .

they told me sorry you'll have to figure out another way to get both cable and satellite at your home  .

basically , i is able to do this by hooking up the cable to my samsung hdtv , which has multiple inputs and select the 'source' from the samsung  .

i would have preferred to have everything hooked into the vip622 and selected my desired source from it , but its not to be , at least not till they fix this problem  .

i suspect it's a programming glitch in the receivers firmware , but who knows  .

anyway , this is my main gripe with this receiver and is why i give it only a 6  .

my previous dishnetwork receiver is able to accomodate both satellite source and cable source and i assumed that this newer piece of equipment could do the same  .

i is wrong  .

after years and years of happy tivo ownership , i had no choice but to move on when i upgraded to an hd system  .

the series 3 tivo is way too expensive and would have required a switch to time warner cable (which i didn't want  .

to do)  .

directv's dvr looked like a bad piece of hardware with a bad ui  .

cnet's review of the vip622 swayed me and i signed up with dish network and got two 622's after a couple of weeks of remote    hurling frustration over the ridiculous ui (talk about not user friendly  .

) , i'm getting used to the system's quirks  .

but still , compared to tivo , it's like going from a rolls    royce to a yugo  .

it gets you where you want to go , but there is not much to recommend the yugo , if you have the choice having two recordable satellite tuners plus an ota tuner , and still being able to watch a fourth program while recording three others is fantastic  .

love that feature picture quality is terrific  .

picture in picture capability is great (i don't use the capability of sending an hd signal to one set and an sd signal to another , since i have two hd sets  .

) having the current channel running in a window while you're in menus is great but but but like many vip622 users , i experience a lot of video dropout       couple of times a day  .

i experience audio dropout once in a while  .

reception on some hd channels is hit and miss for a while       sometimes i'd get a channel , sometimes i wouldn't , and it seemed random when i'd get reception and for how long  .

had to get the installers back out to reset the dish to increase the signal power on satellite 129 , fwiw most annoyingly , the box sometimes records a show , it appears in my list of recorded programs , but the box won't let me replay the show       i just get error message 04  .

customer service is quick to tell me this is a known problem and immediately shipped out a new box to replace the bad one  .

but this just should not happen oh , my second vip622 , in another room , but pulling signals off the same dish has had no problems at all  .

perfect functioning from day one (knock on wood) the box itself is fine  .

the ui is learanable and ultimately functional but feels as if no one involved in its creation ever used it (i mean , a virtual keyboard with no wraparound function  .

having to go about four menus deep to cancel and/or delete a program  .

come on ) the technical problems are unforgiveable i'd give a lot for a tivo box hooked up to a directv dish  .

or even a tivo box that supported all of time warner cable's functionality  .

sadly , such things don't exist so the vip622 probably is the best of the rest  .

but that does not make it good call it a 7 for functionality (vs a 9 for tivo) and a 4 for reliability  .

quality of picture and sound (and dish network's hd offerings) bump the average up a bit , so call it a 6  .

grudgingly .

i've been a directv customer for a long , long time i wanted to upgrade to hd and basically it is going to cost me $300 for the unit and they couldn't install it for 2months so there ya have it i'm with dish now , and here's my take while many think having one box control two tv's is revolutionary ; to me it's simply a way for them to cut expenses on hardware  .

prior to the 622 , i could watch a live show , and record 2 other shows at the same time not anymore  .

you can record one show and watch a live show or you can record 2 live shows and watch one pre    recorded what reviewers , dish or anyone fails to tell everyone is this when you are recording one live show , and watching another at the same time the second tv has to be viewing whatever is being recording  .

after the installer is going over the system with me , and told me this i is floored  .

how stupid  .

it basically makes the second tv useless if i'm recording one show , watching another , the second tv must show what is being recorded  .

stupid  .

try changing the channel , and you'll get a nice warning screen bah  .

i've also had multiple problems with the 2nd tv just not working or picking up the signal (it's only about 15 feet away) i'm also not fond of the menu system and dvr system  .

tivo is much easier to set up events for example if you wanted to record a whole season of a show , it literally took like 2 button presses now , you have to jump through menus filter out events , etc my last complaint about the unit is that it loses settings or something i've had the unit for a week , and had to call dish twice to have them reconfigure the signals on the positive the hd quality is brilliant amazing even  .

i love the hd picture the menu is very nice , and much easier to navigate than my last dvr i especially like by simply hitting the 'menu' button , you can switch between   all subscribed channels , all channels or all hd channels very useful  .

now don't get too excited about dish's claim of 'more hd channels than anyone' sure , they have more than dtv but give me a break  .

they play the same show , over and over and over again on most of the hd channels the cartoon channel has 3 shows , for example again , the hd is really amazing and well worth the cost of programming (i did not have to pay anything for the unit) however sd is horrible i've heard mixed reactions , but for me it is just horrible compression  .

sadly , i cannot get local hd channels from dish just yet ; so i'm forced to use 'regular' local channels  .

the picture quality looks like someone too a video and compressed it to make it web    viewable pitiful to me , the bottom line is this if you want great hd content and can get local hd in your area ; it's a must have but , if you are spoiled by tivo and live in an non local hd area ; i would wait i like my unit and the service is fair i still find it totally unacceptable to have dvr where one tv is forced to watch what is being recorded .

i acquired this unit from dish in april of 2006 in order to view orlando network channels and several additional channels in hd  .

the unit is hooked up with no problems by the dish installer with one notable exception   the hdmi hookup to my phillips lcd tv did not function  .

i had this same problem with the dish's previous hd dvr  .

they continue to tell me they're still working on resolving the problem the hd picture using the component cables looks very good  .

the unit is easy to operate , but offers little improvement over the previous model  .

most notably , the hd recording capacity is still only 25 hours , which can be used up fairly quickly here i should also note that , almost 10 months after receiving this unit dish still has not upgraded its orlando network stations to hd , in spite of their representations that all top 25 markets (orlando is #19) would be upgraded to hd by may of 2006 a continual frustration i experience when using this unit is the frequency of notices telling me to run the point disk diagnostic  .

i'm unable to use the unit until i run this diagnostic (everything's always fine) or turn the unit off and on a few times another scary notice i've received several times states that the hard drive is corrupted and that i must completely erase it before it may be used again  .

fortunately , so far at least clicking ok on this message has not resulted in the loss of hard drive content or any other actual issue .

i've never had dish , but this letter may be reason enough to not ever get direct tv  .

your technician arrived at my house last tuesday and set up 1 out of 6 boxes  .

he then left my house  .

after spending 90 minutes on the phone with direct tv , your company suggested sending out another technician  .

i is told by the local office that the manager would be calling me that afternoon  .

he never showed up or even bothered to call  .

the next day , i is promised the manager would be calling by mid morning  .

once again he did not call or show up  .

this all comes after a lost work order for my install that backed it up 2 weeks , 2 calls that were promised to be returned by management that were never received , an excessive amount of time wasted by me , and numerous headaches and frustration  .

i'm not even sure what i'm paying for at this point  .

i have now spoken with at least a dozen direct tv employees all expressing their sorrow for my situation , only to pass the buck on to the next guy who does not give a rats ass about me  .

it has been handsdown the worst customer service i have ever received  .

it's hard for me to beleive a company of your size allows this sort of thing to go on  .

in any other company someone would lose their job for the blatant disregard your people have had for me and my family please feel free to contact me if any of you people give a s  about my service or my money  .

in the mean time i will tell everyone that i know the way that i is treated and the horrible service your company provides yours truly  .

when hooked up via hdmi images look very blotchy , especially dark shades  .

i had 2 of these  .

i thought the first one is defective but the second one is the same  .

i compared it against component and the component hookup looked mauch better  .

i also compared it with a second tv i own and the results were the same the last test i did is with batman begins  .

i recorded it and compared it against the quality of my sony upconversion dvd player (using hdmi)and again the dvd player quality is much better than the watching it through the dish network hdmi connection .

i switched from tivo/directv to dishnetwork  .

what i've found is that each side has drawbacks that could be easily rectified with simple programming    or if each system just took the benefits of the other  .

tivo is overall an easier interface to use , but there were some significant drawbacks that dishnetwork has solved  .

but , there are an equal amount of drawbacks that dishnetwork could easily solve but have not (as mentioned above)  .

also , the 30 hours of hd space gets filled up very quickly    to my surprise  .

once you start watching hd , you find normal programming to be very poor  .

so , i focus on hd recordings and am always full the second tv recording option is a pain in the rear  .

it's not like tivo/directv where it will just easily record 2 shows at once and resolve what to record by priority  .

with this receiver , you have to pick which tv to record to (tv1 or tv2) , and you have to pick it in advance most of the time (when you create the repeated    program mode)  .

it's hard to explain , but the end result is that i often cannot record a second program depending on what tv i am watching at the time i want to record the second program  .

my receiver does not record 3 shows at once    hd or otherwise    and dishnetwork has told me only 2 can be recorded at once  .

but , the way they have it setup , i frequently cannot accomplish this another huge problem is that the hd quality programming can only be viewed on one tv with this receiver  .

the output to the second tv is not hd  .

so , if your watching of tv programs is balanced between your living room and bedroom , you will not be able to enjoy hd quality on one of the tvs  .

huge drawback there is a limit on outputs on this receiver as well  .

with my directv , i could output an extra set of audio channels for my receiver (which helps with zone 2 or 3 outputs on many receivers)  .

as a result , i cannot listen to dishnetwork music through my outdoor speakers or wireless speakers anymore i am considering buying a second hd dvr for my second tv so that i do not run into some of the above problems  .

the cost is significant , however , and it's very hard to find these for sale anywhere  .

so , i'm inclined to wait for another model or for more availability of this one .

i have had the 942 for over a year  .

i have had vonage for longer than that  .

their receivers cannot support vonage as a phone provider and they are very rude when you ask them why  .

they charge an additional 4  .

99 a month if the receiver is not connected to a phone line  .

i asked them to forgo the additional charge on the 942 and they were rude that i would even ask such a thing  .

look , it's their lack of forsight that has caused the problem with the oledre and new 622 dvr'  .

when i asked if the newer 622 is going to support vonage they treated me badly again  .

their charlie chat is a joke  .

i'ts all staged for the questions they want to answer , not for questions that will actually help make the product better .

first of all , cnet is wrong  .

you cannot record 3 shows while watching another  .

you can record 2 shows while watching a recorded one , or record one show while watching one live show this dvr has nice features and a good interface unfortunately , it too often has no audio , constantly needs to be rebooted , sometimes records nothing but a black screen , and will sometimes show something on a channel , but when you record or even go to that channel , that show is not there (may be a dish problem , rather than the dvr) we have had dish for several years , and have had to get 3 or 4 of these 622's , because they just get worse and worse  .

they never work 100% correctly , even when brand    new  .

sometimes , something will be recording , but there's no red light  .

sometimes it is recording a black screen , but if you go to that channel , the show is there  .

often , there is no audio , either on the recording or on live tv , but there will be audio on the other  .

has a lot of trouble connecting to the phone line for ppv or uploading dishgames scores sometimes , if you fast forward the end of a program , it will automatically restart that program , and you're ffing through the beginning w/o realizing it right away  .

sometimes , you simply cannot ff or rewind a recording we stuck with dish and these dvrs for many years , but between this dvr's constant problems , and dish networks lack of customer service , we are switching to uverse  .

better features , more channels , and a better price .

i'm glad i didn't purchase this device  .

i am not pleased with the recording options available  .

i don't have an ota way to get tv signals , so i can only record 2 shows at one time , but then i have to watch something i have previousely recorded  .

i do not understand why i have to watch the show i want to record  .

there are times when there are 2 shows on at the same time that we like  .

we want to record one and watch the other  .

this can only be accomplished if we record to tv2 but then my kids usually cancel the recording because they want to watch something else  .

if the cable companies can provide a dvr that allows you to watch one show and record another at the same time  .

then it seems like an advanced dvr like this one should also have that technology .

it's nearly impossible to consistently specify which tv the dvr records to  .

we have even provided the dishnetwork tech support people with detailed , step    by    step instructions on how to reproduce the problem , but most of them are too dumb to follow or report the problem unfortunately , directv and comcast are both just as poor choices this product is a great reason to take up reading again .

the summary is as follows  .

it's great when it works  .

but i had severe problems with it 1  .

first one is doa 2  .

after 10 months , the hdmi port died  .

dish updated firmware which caused an incompatibility issue between this box and my panasonic projector  .

i had to ship my projector to panasonic for an upgrade it's great when it works , but very unreliable .

we had a directv sd tivo  .

we wanted a high definition dvr and directv had few hd channels and a poorly rated hd drv  .

the dish networks dvr works well  .

the positives are   the rf remote is awesome , why do we have to live with ir  .

the fast forward so supper fast  .

picture quality is very good  .

deleting multiple programs at once is a plus  .

choosing what channel you want to send out each of the tuner on  .

the negatives are   they charge you for two tuners  .

the charge you if you dont have it hooked to a phone line , it calls mid day and does not detect if your on the line  .

the software is poor compared to a tivo  .

i think tivo must have patents on a lot of the features that they offer , otherwise dish network needs to hire me to help them fix it  .

the software is everything on a dvr  .

to find shows to watch is difficult on dish networks dvr  .

on a tivo you simply start typing the name of what your looking for and it will give you a list of shows starting with the letters you typed in  .

it will show you all the shows and what channel that they are on  .

type in star it will show you star trek enterprise on udn (hd) , star trek enterprise on scifi (sd) , star trek voyager , star wars episode i , star wars return of the jedi , etc  .

you could pick a season pass to just to star trek enterprise udn and it would only record star trek enterprise on udn in hd , or list it higher in the season pass and it would record the hd first then the show on scifi  .

secondly if you find a show that you want to record but is at a time when there is two shows that are more important or you dont want it to record during prime time  .

the tivo will show a list of show times to pick from , i usually pick times in the middle of the night or when im at work  .

you cant do that either on a dish network dvr  .

i switch from dish network to comcast and bought a tivo hd box  .

dish network is requiring me to return the hd dvr i paid $300  .

00 for , the sd dvr they gave me and the lnbs off the dishes  .

they also had a guy call me to try convince me to stay with them  .

he is really aggressive and argumentive , finally i had to hang up on him  .

if you never used a tivo you will be happy  .

if you have used a tivo you will never be satisfied with this receiver  .

i have a suggestion to dish network and directv , stop being greedy and give us tivos with our service , then we will choose you on your programming , not your dvr .

starting july 1 , cable operators will be required to provide set    top boxes that don't include integrated security features that link the box to that operator the fcc believes that by separating the set    top box from the cable operator , a marketplace would be created in the sales of the boxes , which could lead to driving down the prices consumers pay for cable television several major consumer electronics manufacturers have argued that if set    top boxes weren't directly linked to the provision of cable service , they could enter the set    top market  .

consumers could get a cable card from their service provider that they could insert into a set    top box purchased at a consumer electronics store  .

the cards would ensure that consumers could only access channels that they paid for comcast had appealed to the fcc , saying that cable cards are soon to be made redundant by technology that would allow the security features of the card to be downloaded directly the industry's lobby group , the national cable telecommunication association , has estimated that the fcc rule will cost consumers an extra $600 million a year , based on an estimate of $2 to $3 per card the fcc rejected this argument , but did leave comcast the right to appeal in a statement late wednesday , comcast said it is very disappointed and called the fcc's decision regrettable  .

the rejection of this waiver means millions of american consumers won't have the opportunity to enter the age of digital television easily and affordably , the company said  .

this amounts to an fcc tax of hundreds of millions of dollars on consumers with no countervailing benefits  .

comcast said it will immediately seek a full fcc review the fcc did conditionally approve a waiver request from a smaller cable operator , bend cable communications , which said it planned to make the full transition to a digital signal by 2008 this transition is seen by the fcc as a higher priority than the creation of a market for set    top boxes the fcc also said it would delay enforcement action against other smaller cable operators that have placed orders for new    style boxes with manufacturers , but have been told they wo not be ready by july 1 earlier wednesday , speaking at a question    and    answer session at the consumer electronics show in las vegas , martin said that he is not likely to grant the waivers of the largest players in the cable industry who have asked for them simply because they think a better technology is around the corner the deadline has already been extended twice ; companies were initially supposed to have been compliant by july 1 , 2005 the dispute over set    top boxes is the latest in a rapidly deteriorating relationship between martin and the cable industry in december , martin pushed through reform of the cable tv franchising process , which makes it easier for telephone companies to provide video services and compete with cable operators and martin has repeatedly said that the cable industry is the only industry the fcc regulates in which rates have consistently increased while all others have dropped off in the last decade    contact   201    938    5400  .

i think this is the 'king' as far as integrated receiver , dvr , and programming in one component unfortunately , reliability , software glitches , reboots , etc  .

take away a lot of enjoyment the 622 is another reason proprietary equipment is a huge mistake  .

we shoud be able to buy receivers on the open market and let dish , dtv , comcast , and the rest just compete for services  .

let the quality electronics manufacturers build the equipment and compete for low prices .

i upgraded from a flawless 522 to the hd 622 recently and had nothing but headaches since the trade  .

first , installer put up a dish 1000 next to the dish 500 satellite dish  .

now i have two sat dishes aside one another (looks like mickey mouse ears)  .

tech said that i would receive the best signal this way  .

i thought the 1000 would take care of that  .

anyway , first 622 worked for about 20 minutes after the tech left  .

i called dish , went through all the debugs , and after about 2 hours on the phone , the tech returned , and stated the first 622 is bad  .

five days later , the 2nd 622 arrived  .

so far , i had to reboot this 622 once due to pixelation and pauses  .

arrhhhh  .

i am this close to switching to directv  .

dish did give me one month of free service for my patience  .

so far , 1 week , some twitching here and there , but nothing major  .

one more black out or pause , i'm switching the 622 back to a 522 or going to another carrier  .

good luck  .

i have had three units in two years and my current one now dead  .

i am not credited with down time for my dish network  .

i need to pay for shipping the dead unit back to them .

i've been a dish network subscriber for about 14 months , and am currently waiting for dish network to send me my third vip622 after my second unit died just yesterday  .

to be fair , my first unit worked flawlessly for about a year before it bit the dust  .

basically , one day , it simply would not power on , and the reason for this failure still remains a mystery  .

after a lengthy troubleshooting call to dish network tech support , they finally ran out of unplug the receiver and wait 15 seconds solutions , and decided to ship out a replacement dvr  .

five days later , i got a refurbished unit via ups the replacement unit came with instructions on how to set it up , but they were not correct as they instructed me to skip the comprehensive setup test after connecting the receiver to the tv  .

after following the printed instructions , and not getting any picture , another call to dish network is made , and i found out that the comprehensive setup test is in fact required  .

interestingly , it turned out that i would have had to call dish no matter what , since they had to activate the receiver from their end anyway  .

this is not mentioned in the included instructions , either  .

from start to finish , this process took about 60 minutes longer than it should have , and the whole ordeal left a bad taste in my mouth the refurb only lasted two months before suffering a similar fate  .

again , i spent some quality time with the customer support people at dish network , and is ultimately told to unplug the unit and wait 45 minutes for the receiver to finish its 'recovery cycle'  .

if that doesn't work , call us back  .

with this third receiver , i insisted that a technician come out to our house free of charge to install the new receiver and eliminate any possibilities of this happening in the future , which the dish network folks agreed to with surprisingly little hassle  .

as it stands , i have to wait at least 3 days for my new receiver (i insisted on a new unit , and not another refurb , which dish agreed to) , and another 3 days for the technician to come to my house i guess it wouldn't be such a big deal if it was not for the fact that we lose all our saved recordings and have to re    establish our timers and scheduled recordings with each dvr that dies  .

as it stands , i have never owned any electronic equipment that is as unreliable as this    ever as a rule , i'm pretty dissatisfied with this receiver so far , and am very disappointed in dish network in general  .

i'm still very irritated that they canceled their voom network programming and replaced it with crap like tennis channel hd and hd fishing  .

i would switch back to directv in a heartbeat if it was not for the fact that their hd dvr got universally poor reviews from cnet users  .

my only other option is comcast , and i do not really consider that to be much of an option at all .

the vip 622 is not set up for timer recording of off    air programming  .

using my antenna for local channels , i do not receive an on screen program guide and therefore , am not able to record the network/local channels after inquiries with dish tech support and cooperate people , i have not made any progress  .

this situation is common for all 622's i have been told  .

my previous hd receiver (811  .

) (not sure of the model #) had the capability if i want to record the local channels i would have to buy the local channel package two years ago , before we had the antenna , we subscribed to the local channel package and the picture quality is terrible  .

our antenna gives us excellent picture quality  .

i wonder if this is legal  .

anyone have experience with this problem  .

it's a shame that neither directv nor dish network will break down and pay tivo what ever it is that they want had an old tivo (phillips) with directv but it is incapable of hd  .

but it is wonderful went with dish network and have this dvr  .

it's awkward to program , and horrible to find a program to record  .

and , if a network should time shift a program , the vip622 goes ahead and records the replacement program , completely loosing that which had been moved to another time slot occasionally it will lock    up and just quit for no apparent reason  .

then , one waits forever while it reboots and re    finds the satellites , even though neither they nor the vip622 have moved  .

if one is watching a sport contest or the news or something that is not going to be repeated , the 5 to 10 minute wait while it finds the satellites it lost is quite aggravating if you liked recording vhs tapes , you'll love this unit  .

but if you ever had tivo , you'll be as frustrated with the limitations of the vip622 as have i .

the dish dvr 622 works great as long as closed captioning is not needed  .

however , as a deaf individual , i do need captioning  .

the system requires freqent hard resets because the captions disappear  .

a reset solves the problem , but is annoying because a reset takes several minutes  .

meanwhile , whatever you were watching keeps on going get the drift  .

another problem is that when you have the second tv option enabled , software glitches cause the system to malfunction (captioning problems)  .

the remedy is to make sure that both remotes be used to turn the dvr 622 off , or to stand    by  .

if one is left on , there is often a captioning issue requiring a hard reset when you turn one tv back on captioning issues also include dish's hd offerings  .

although dish's channel guide lists programs as having captioning , when you try to watch the program , there is no captioning  .

of the hd locals (houston tx) , only two have working via satellite captioning ; however , using the over    the    air antenna , those locals that do not have hd captioning through satellite do have hd captioning over    the    air .

i had issues getting the 622 installed but that another story  .

i have been with dish for 5 years and decided to upgrade to the 622  .

i had the receiver hooked up to our sony 43 crt rear pro  .

at first and the picture is ok  .

the tv is 4  3 and set up for 1080i but only had component cable hook ups  .

we purchased a sammy hl 5687w 1080p and hooked it up via hdmi  .

the picture is out standing  .

the tv is everything the reviews said it would be  .

the picture in hd is amazing  .

is is the proper word here  .

the connection lasted 3 days and then went cows udder up  .

it did not go all at once it would lose signal and a little shake of the wire would restore the picture  .

i called and ask waass up with this thing because i thought that it is an internal connetion of the cable  .

but the tech told me that it is a software problem  .

now it does not work at all and we are back to component cables  .

dish says that it will be a month or so before the can address that software poblem  .

but now i read that others have been waiting for months to have the same problem solved  .

i should have read the review and studied up like i do on all my other purchases  .

i am suprised that cnet rated the piece of equipment as high as they did , when this does not seem to be an isolated problem  .

this really sucks big time .

i is one of the first customers to receive the vip622 in may of 2006  .

it worked great for 3 weeks and then i lost the picture from the hdmi output  .

it works on component video cables but you buy hdtv's for the highest quality picture and that is just not available on the component video cable  .

with all of the problems this receiver has its best to wait another year until dish has time to fix the bugs  .

i have had the receiver for 3 1/2 months and they have fixed none of the problems and with the software updates that dish sends and they have created more problems with each successive software update  .

i have been a dish customer since 1996 and this is the first time that i regret upgrading my equipment  .

its not just the bugs , it is also the fact that for the first 2 1/2 months dish tech support tried to blame my cables , the way the dish tech hooked up the receiver , they even tried to blame it on hdmi and its standards and when i didnt buy that i is mysteriously disconnected  .

what it all comes down to is that a software update that dish sent to the receiver knocked out the hdmi and caused all of the other problems and in 3 1/2 months they are no closer to finding what they did wrong with the updates that caused the problems this receiver has great potential but it will be some time before it is bug free and worth purchasing .

i cancelled my dishnetwork service after being a customer for over 4 years  .

the same day i had my new box installed , a large pop up appeared and would not go away unless i connected a phone line  .

when i called dishnetwork they informed me that a phone line is required  .

(this is the first mention of this)  .

i know enough about technology to know that the box will function without a phone line and the only reason to attach a phone line is so they can upload data about my viewing habits  .

i would have no problem with this if they asked my permission but instead they try to strongarm you into connecting a phone line  .

the real kicker is that if you pay them an extra $5 per month they will download a fix so that you do not need the phone line  .

they also offered me a free wireless phone jack but i refused since i consider these practices to be unethical  .

they also offered to waive the $5 fee for 3 months which i also refused i never thought i would go back to cable but i am now witing for cable to be installed  .

too bad dishnetwork has would rather loose a loyal customer than not collect my viewing habits  .

i guess that shows where the real money is  .

ps    i also have a tivo box with a phone line connected so i am not paranoid about big brother etc  .

i am upset that they tried to force me to connect a phone line and they want to charge $5 a month not to collect data on me and my family .

this unit has promise , but do us , and you a favor and dont release something until you have it working in a dependable fashion  .

the ideas are great , the features are wonderful , the application sucks .

i'm on my second unit  .

first one would freeze when going from one recorded show to another  .

remote would not work  .

if it is recording when it froze , it would continue recording until it is reset  .

second unit when i hit the back button on a recorded show it froze  .

remote would not work , then it shut itself down  .

when it came back on it is with a (015) screen searching for satellite and is stuck on 1 of 5  .

called service , reset by unplugging then had to wait through the searching for satellite sequence and then reloading the program guide  .

so i missed another program i wanted to watch .

these units do not last , if you have one , back up your movies to a usb hd  .

if it worked for me like cnet described it would be a 9  .

i have owned a 622 for about a year  .

i hate the fact that it changes channels without warning  .

this is a common problem with sports  .

if you are watching nba finals from the buffer and it's programmed to record a simpsons re    run , it switches without warning and you loose the buffer  .

i miss tivo's software , but have to use satellite in my area  .

second   about 60% of the time i turn it on and there is no audio on non    hd channels  .

look on line and you will find lots of people with this problem  .

exchanged units with no change  .

can unplug unit to reset and audio might return  .

dish has no answer  .

it's so frustrating because it has the potential to be great  .

i'd love to take a sledge hammer to it , if there is any other option .

dish recently (as of 5/24/08) dropped it's voom network  .

this is roughly about 20 genre specific channels all with 1080i programming  .

instead dish has added several channels which simulate hd  .

but they  killed  these hd channels , opting to save some money i suppose  .

if you are looking to get dish for hd , i'd recommend considering other alternatives at this point  .

it's pretty sad that their kung fu , monster/horror , style , news channels in hd are now all scrapped and they are no better then any other distributor of hd content .

this has been a headache for me  .

first i purchased the product under the assumption that it is hdmi ready based on thier ads , then after a while i lost my hdmi signal just like the other reviewers have commented    i is told it is a software problem on their part and that they are working on it , 6 months later i'm still waiting on them to fix  .

now i purchased a new tv for room #2 and i is getting a very snowy picture  .

after talking to the dish netork tech department i is told that they have a software problem with thier equipment (again) and right now thier is nothing they can do about it  .

i asked to be released from the contract without penalities since i is sold on a clear picture and since they could not provide this , that i is going to be searching for a new provider  .

they again insisted that they could not release me from the contract without penalaties  .

i am currently searching for an attorney to bring a class action lawsuit against dish network for not delivering what is advertised and paid for  .

i have been aggrevated , lost of income waing for resolve and tech's to come to my house , installtion payments and now the role of hiring an attorney  .

after reading the reviews i think i have a pretty good support group .

i notice that this review took place more than a year ago but i just got mine at the end of february and it is still not ready for prime time  .

software is full of problems  .

does not seem to be a priority for dish  .

freezing of picture is maddening and it takes at least two or three minutes to reboot  .

additionally , for the hearing impaired , the closed captions are a problem  .

the hdmi out does not support dolby and if it is connected to a home theatre system , another connection for dolby (like optical audio) is necessary .

i upgraded from a 942 to a 622  .

i have found the 622 to be buggy , suffering frequent audio and video drops and video stuttering  .

if you copy to dvd you are likely to end up with an unwatchable program due to above mentioned issues  .

i have gone through three of these machines in 6 months , the last one arriving doa the hardware is of poor quality and i also think there are flaws in mpeg4 transmission  .

and do not even think about a dish1000 for hd reception on the west coast , it will not pick up the 129 bird well , you will need a dedicated 24 dish .

the 622 is plagued with audio issues in its recorder   audio drops out , breaks up and/or is out of sync  .

dish acknowledges the issue , but months later have no fix  .

its a known software problem and our engineers are working on it .

i've been with dish for several years but am now ready to leave them far behind  .

you cannot place this unit in a cabinet , it overheats  .

i had problems with audio/video syn immediately after getting this unit  .

first i is told to re    boot the unit  .

after re    booting constantly with no success i contact service and is told that the unit , despite having a hdmi connection , is not really compatible with hdmi i should switch to component cables which should fix my problem  .

it didn't  .

i still have recurring audio/video syn problems  .

i still have distorted/garbled audio problems  .

i just have big problems with this unit and dish want do anything to fix the problem  .

maybe dirttv will be better either way i'm gone  .

surely nothing could be worse  .

unless you want headaches do not get this dvr .

do not buy get a vip 722 skip the 622 it is defective  .

listen to me dont get dish network  .

their customer support are so bad you will regret ever getting their service  .

we paid for their monthly equipment protection , but when the dvr over heated , they wont send us a new one .

i've been a dish network customer for a little under 1 year  .

in that time , i'm now on my 3rd vip622 unit  .

twice , my unit has suffered a fatal crash for no apparent reason  .

each time , i lost over 100 hours of programming  .

that lack of reliability is just unacceptable  .

my former dvr , a tivo unit , never crashed in the 5 years i had one  .

do yourself a favor    do not get this unit  .

when my 18 month contract is up , i'm going back to tivo .

learn from my experience  .

dish network provided the best television picture i have ever had  .

the channel selection is terrific  .

their dual tv receiver is a wonderful product  .

if anything goes wrong , however , dont plan to ever get it fixed  .

this is their achilles heel  .

you will be put through a never    ending gauntlet of irrelevant questions , delay tactics and stumbling blocks  .

there will be a transparent and desperate attempt to prove that the problem is not theirs  .

in the event they deign to favor you with a service call , expect to wait a month and expect to pay for it  .

apparently , if the dish they installed is not aimed correctly , it is your problem , not theirs  .

if the receiver goes on the fritz , well , no tv for you  .

i is a top    of    the    line , premium hd service customer and this is how i is treated .

i'm now on my fourth vip622 in the last twelve months  .

my first one worked great , with hdmi video output , for about six months  .

then it went out , and each of the replacements dish network has sent me haven't worked out of the box , or have worked for only a very short time before going out  .

i've read lots of posts on the internet from others with very similar experiences  .

so if you're planning on installing this hd    dvr on your new hd television , be warned  .

hdmi may not work  .

dish will probably tell you to use either the coax or component video output alternates on the back of the machine  .

but these don't provide you the same video quality , and it's really not the solution is it  .

if you buy an hd dvr with hdmi video , you deserve hd video  .

dish has told me that the problem is software related , but i've waited six months now for that software download that's going to fix everything  .

it hasn't happened and i doubt it ever will  .

in the meantime , my $600 , 400    disc dvd player is going unused , because i'm now connecting to the vip622 the component video cables i used to have connected to the dvd player  .

this is my only complaint about this machine , and it is a big problem which lots of people are experiencing  .

do not be stupid like me and buy ths machine without first doing your homework , or you'll be sorry like me .

i want my tivo back  .

i had directv with tivo and switched to dish when i went hd  .

what a mistake  .

i'm now watching much less tv because dish doesn't have an alphabetical listing of upcoming shows  .

i used to search through this on tivo and come across all kinds of interesting shows to record  .

now , if i don't see something in today's newspaper tv listings , i don't have any idea if anything good is coming up  .

dish doesn't have a trailing 60 minutes on both inputs so usually the channel i want to watch is on the input that cannot be backed up  .

dish tv has to be shut off when you're not using it ; directv never had to be shut off  .

i saw a full page ad in my newspaper today that said cnet raved about dish tv  .

i could not believe it  .

i hate dish tv  .

i talked 3 people out of getting dish tv in the last month alone  .

they conned me into an 18 month contract or i'd have dropped them already  .

i'm counting down the days until i can be free of dish tv  .

it's so bad that , everyday , i think i should just break the contract and dump dish tv .

i changed from a directv hughes dvr2 with tivo to the dish network's hd    dvr vip622  .

i swtiched to dish because directv refused to give a very long time customer any perks for upgrading their system to hd  .

they begged me to stay with cash off when i is cancelling their service  .

too late  .

i know that if i had upgraded with directv that their units no longer have tivo so i'm sure i'd be just as dissatisfied  .

this unit is so freaking un    user friendly  .

it takes 4x as many steps to do what my old dvr did  .

it's so over the top and complicated       why  .

it's so frustrating just to set up your regular shows to record  .

and , i found out with the 200 channel package i've lost a lot of channels so now i have to upgrade for $10/mo to the 250  .

there's pixelization blips which i never had before with my old dvr  .

sure , i've only had the thing since saturday so i've got some re    learning to do but why do i have to press select when i turn the tv on to get past the dish logo  .

totally annoying  .

if anyone has any helpful hints they are most welcome  .

oh , and why does cnet only show the oldest reviews  .

should not you show the most recent first  .

i cant believe this is supposed to be the best dvr out there  .

i am on my 2nd dvr in 4 months and have to get this new one serviced i have recorded hd shows that have only background sounds , no voices  .

skipping is a big problem too  .

the most consistant problam is stuttering , this annoying blurr of sound when someone is talking  .

i cant understand what is said when this happens  .

this occurs so frequent that i am ready to cancel service and send this unit back for good my dishnetwork reception is very strong so that is not the problem .

i recently upgraded to a dish 622 receiver  .

the hd programming is perfect , but the sd programming is very poor quality  .

i described the picture as grainy with color bleed  .

this is on both my brand new hd tv and on my existing tv  .

the tech is 7 hours late showing up for the install (scheduled for 8    12am and showed at 7pm) and i only had it on hd channels while he is there so i didn't see the problem with the sd channels until he left  .

the tech is very nice and left his personal phone # so i called him first thing the next morning  .

he said he's seen this same problem about 10 times and it's a receiver problem  .

even so , i called dish and they sent me a replacement receiver  .

same problem with the replacement  .

called dish again , and they scheduled another installer visit  .

he ran a cable straight from the dish to the receiver to eliminate all house wiring and the problem still existed where hd pic is flawless and sd pic is grainy  .

i is using an hdmi cable  .

we also tried s video and the banana jacks and all 3 methods looked poor  .

(also keep in mind i had dish before and i know what the pic quality should be with sd programming from them  .

) the 622 is nowhere close to the quality i had before with my 625 receiver  .

this installer called several co    workers and 2 of 3 guys he called admitted seeing this problem several times before  .

i called dish again  .

this time they sent a regional technical manager to my house  .

he didn't even try an experiment to fix the problem  .

he acknowledged this as a known problem with the receiver and that there is nothing he could do to resolve the issue  .

i called dish yet again  .

they wanted to sent another tech to my house by i refused to continue on with this painful waste of my time  .

i sheduled an installer to come rip out everything hd and returned to my 625 receiver and have good quality picture again , i just do not have hd  .

i'll wait for directv to add more channels and switch to them .

i bought the vip622 because directv did not have an equivalent hd dvr (they do now)  .

i is struck by the excellent image quality but everything else is a nightmare for anyone familiar with the tivo user    interface , this box will be a challenge  .

finding and recording shows is an exercise in frustration another problem is with the rf remote  .

one of the big theoretical advantages of the vip622 is its ability to serve up programs to two tvs simultaneously  .

unfortunately the reach of the second remote control is such that , for me at least , this turned out to be a pipe dream within days , i had decided to send it back under their 30    day money back warranty but that's when the story really gets ugly   to my surprise , dish has refused to credit me $200 out of the $250 i paid for the system , claiming that this is an upgrade fee  .

when i ordered it , i is assured that every penny i spend is refundable if i am not satisfied but now they say i is misinformed .

this unit sounded great when we decided to upgrade from our standard receivers to an hd/dvr combo  .

we were very excited about this unit to go with our new plasma tv  .

when the installer is done i could not believe how terrible the picture quality was  .

also , the unit required multiple resets and the dvr recordings would freeze and show little squares across the screen  .

the picture on the remote tv is even worse  .

after three attempts to fix it and bringing in another new receiver , we asked for our money back and now have our old receivers back  .

terrible product that caused way too much stress  .

i expected more from a product this expensive .

do not buy this piece of crap  .

i have had nothing but headaches with this equipment and dish network in general  .

i have gone 3 through 622s and all had the same problem , they all over heat  .

this box runs super hot to where it can almost burn your hand  .

first i had the box in my cabinet , that is well ventilated , with my receiver and xbox 360  .

all seemed great but after just 45 minutes of watching tv a screen would appear saying the box is running to hot and i need to unplug it to have it cooled off  .

next i took it out of the cabinet and put it on a shelf that is completely open ; now it only over heats every 90 minutes  .

i called dish and they would send me a replacement vip 622 free of charge  .

well i received the new box with in 5 days and sent the old one back and guess what it still over heated  .

heck this thing would over heat in a blizzard and dish is so kind to charge me again , $300 , for this  .

talked to dish again about the problem with the box and they said the would ship another replacement , and yes they have charged me another $300 for this replacement even though it is supposed to free since it is a replacement  .

the only saving grace in all of this is the people at sprint they have put my one month bill of over $1000 in dispute  .

i have cancelled my dish network as of 4    11    06 and tried to ask for a refund on this equipment since it has never worked which they refuse to but i have to return the box or they will charge me the full amount for the box  .

i have put up with dish for 7 weeks and thank god the local cable company is now in our area so these guys no longer have me buy the short and curlies  .

i would tell anyone interested in dish not to do it , unless you are into s m .

you lose tv for at least a week , it will overheat constantly usually when you are in the middle of a great foot ball game , etc  .

the product will not last over 4 month until it either crashes or overheats and shuts off i speak from experience of going through 4 of these even attempted to chargeme for one saying , i damaged it now i have another one that is approximately 4 months old that has started overheating this is when i started researching google and found others are having the same problems  .

i'm sick of it  .

bottom line do not let them pawn one of these units off on you .

do not use this product i've just finished talking with dish network customer service , and they are sending my 4th replacement receiver (3 vip622 and 1 vip722) within the last 6 months  .

this most recent receiver (vip722) only lasted 2 weeks before it had the same issue as all the previous receivers  .

they all begin to reboot themselves multiple times per day  .

this happens while watching tv and while recording       which makes the recording unwatchable  .

i'm lucky in that i do not have a contract commitment with dish , so i am highly considering switching to directv  .

however , i do like the second tv option only provided by dish  .

please think long and hard about how many times you're willing to lose all your programs to swap out your receiver .

once again dish terrible network has refused to replace or refund me for my equiptment i sent to them in error  .

despite my filing a better busines bureau complaint , they simply off an apoloogy for inconvience  .

the took my personal property and destroyed it without any notification to me , in any form , by any route  .

i mistakenly sent my dvd recorder with a harddrive to them  .

it looked similar to the dish receiver i is returning to them and i just packed the wrong one  .

they were both out of my media tower , which i is rearranging after switching to directv  .

they continue and adamantly refuse to cpensate me or replace my dvd recorder with harddrive  .

the show a total disregard for other's personal property , yet would charge me without hesitation for keeping and destroying their property .

we are considering a class action lawsuit for false advertising , deceptive trade practices , fraud and contract breaches for this product  .

the programming and hard drives fail at very high rates resulting in loss of service , out of pocket expense and lost time in reinstalling replacement units  .

daish is well aware of the problem and has been unable and unwilling to remove these from the market  .

we would like to hear from others with these problems  .

we have fired them and are going with a competitor  .

it has been a complete waste of money .

could be a great product if the bugs are worked out  .

dont buy this product iof you really expect to have functionality of two tv's wont work that way  .

if you decide to watch a program on tv 1 and record a program on tv 1 tv 2 will not work  .

poor marketing and explination of function when you sign up  .

dont do it if you intend to use dvr as designed unless you intend on watching everything on your second tv while tv1 records a program  .

i must also point out that i have two older tv's that the standard tuner will not show a picture on because the tv's are not compatible with the second tuner part of the reciever  .

as per the dish network online brochure independently watch and record dish netwok programing on two tv's do not fall for it folks it wont do that period  .

i wish there were a lower rating for this product it deserves it  .

as much as i hate cable i will go back to cable and eventually buy the direct tv dvr and pay a litlle more far a system that works as i have seen at my friends homes .

dear cnet's david katzmaier and public    .

i wish i could write up my opinion on this product being that i am a dish network customer in good standing and have been for 2 1/2yrs according to the company but i cannot  .

not for lack of words or expression but because i've just been told that i cannot have one imagine my dismay  .

plain and simply it's because i've been a customer for 2 1/2yrs  .

i cannot lease the marvelous piece of technology from them  .

i cannot buy the item from the either i is told i must backtrack a bit at this point because i must also add that upon upgrading to the vip211 , unbeknownst to me , due to technical reasons and the tech dept  .

stating that the original hd box is old anyway they reset my acct  .

to begin anew so that now i have only been a customer for the last 18 months  .

what the  .

has this happened to anyone else and does not it smell funny  .

back to the dvr upgrade i'm not allowed to have by dish network  .

i ask then , has this happened to anyone else  .

please let me know if you've been caged in this way by dish network  .

sincerely , pc4me .

well i've had none of the problems of overheating , etc  .

but the issue is the hdmi which worked for 6 months then quit  .

the dish customer support suck  .

they know of the problem which as far as i can tell has been going on for a year  .

they keep claiming that a software update is coming  .

when  .

they make every effort not to replace the unit saying that is only a software issue and will occur again with another unit  .

what i want to know is the truth  .

i been with dish for almost 10 years and the customer service seems to vary from excellent to right now is downright horrible  .

the whole purpose of this unit is to watch hd in all of its 1080i glory  .

but i guess that is not going to happen  .

maybe they should refund the cost of the unit that i paid for  .

what do u think  .

this receiver is plagued by audio problems  .

then you call dish network and they claim that gee whiz , this is the first time they've heard of this receiver having audio problems  .

then you do your homework (a little late unfortunately)and you find out that the forums are littered with people complaining about the same thing you are experiencing  .

these complaints are from 9 months ago and dish still hasn't fixed this so    called software bug  .

i work in the software business and you cannot tell me that they are still working on it  .

what they are now doing is called damage control because they cannot fix the problem  .

the symptoms are   the audio drops out , or goes away completely until you turn power off and on  .

doesn't sound to bad  .

well when you do turn power off , it has to reload the satellite  .

what a pain  .

don't buy this receiver , and do not choose dish network  .

i'm sorry i did .

i am now awaiting the delivery of my third 622  .

the first one quit working a week after installation  .

the second one is a constant headache       it crashed often and had to be re    set , recordings would stop before completion if they recorded at all , during recordings it would often not allow viewing of other live programming , and finally the hdmi port quit working all together  .

so now dish is sending me a third unit i look forward to the day when tivo wins their lawsuit against dish and dish will no longer be able to market such lousy dvrs .
