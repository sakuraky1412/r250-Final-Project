Accuracy is within a few yards .
0 out of 5 stars GPS Navigator doesn't navigate accurately on a straight road .
Speed of calculation, accuracy, and simplicity of operation are top notch .
Accuracy is determined by the maps .
Plus, I've always heard that there are  quirks  with any GPS being accurate, having POIs, etc .
It provides immediate alternatives if the route from the online map program was inaccurate or blocked by an obstacle .
It has yet to disappoint, getting me everywhere with 100% accuracy .
