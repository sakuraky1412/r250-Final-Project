Firewire &#38; ESATA connectivity pretty quiet .
500 mb .
Automatic Sleep mode. ; Inconsistent performance .
Spouses crashed after 3 months .
Then only works periodically .
are you kidding .
my hardrive holds 500 gb .
very good storage backup .
do n't believe in disaster recovery . -RRB-
thanks a lot .
hi , .
thought this would compare .
so why not an esata cable .
i 'm running windows xp pro .
gradually after two weeks file can not be read .
supplied backup software is worthless .
for total system backup use norton ghost .
Thank god for DVD backup I had .
what the hell .
power would go off for no apparent reason .
