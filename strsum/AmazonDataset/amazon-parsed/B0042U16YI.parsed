I/PRP bought/VBD this/DT by/IN matching/VBG up/RP the/DT pictures/NNS ,/, not/RB the/DT model/NN number/NN ,/, and/CC guess/VB what/WP ?/.

It/PRP does/VBZ n't/RB fit/VB ./.

My/PRP$ bad/JJ ./.

I/PRP waited/VBD over/IN thirty/CD days/NNS before/IN trying/VBG it/PRP so/IN I/PRP ran/VBD past/IN the/DT window/NN of/IN being/VBG able/JJ to/TO return/VB it/PRP ./.

Make/VB sure/JJ you/PRP are/VBP replacing/VBG with/IN a/DT model/NN that/WDT is/VBZ compatible/JJ with/IN your/PRP$ fridge/NN ./.

The/DT unit/NN I/PRP got/VBD looks/VBZ workable/JJ and/CC probably/RB would/MD be/VB fine/JJ for/IN the/DT right/JJ replacement/NN ,/, so/IN I/PRP ca/MD n't/RB fault/VB them/PRP for/IN the/DT quality/NN -LRB-/-LRB- or/CC anything/NN else/RB ,/, really/RB -RRB-/-RRB- ./.
