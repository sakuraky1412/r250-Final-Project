i have an mp3 player that i purchased serveral years ago and and fought with it every single day that i have owned it  .

i have the 16 and have had no problems at all  .

it is very quick and easy to get it up and running  .

i find the menu very easy to navigate  .

i love the cover flow  .

i bought it strictly to listen to music , but have found i like watching the music videos on it  .

i would not recommend it if you want to watch full length movie , allthough it has the capibility , i just do not see myself watching a whole movie on that size of screen and the movie would probably use up most of the memory  .

if you are looking for an affordable music player it seems like this is a no brainer  .

i would recommend it to anyone and especially to those who want a simple easy to use , no fuss player .

if you want an ipod that is easy on your eyes and wallet then i suggest this  .

great  .

it rocks i say you should get one there great trust me i'm hard to please .

this ipod nano is the best i've ever seen  .

its lightweight , pretty and is very entertaining  .

i don't know what everyone is talking about with the glare on the screen because i don't see it on mine  .

even in the lightest setting outside , i can still see the screen clearly without glare  .

overall , this new ipod nano is the most beautiful one yet  .

i love how slim it is  .

i personally think its better than the 2g and 3g models  .

its not too hard to control the ipod when in video mode  .

its actually really easy  .

you just have to be aware of what button you're pressing  .

in closing , this is a really good buy and if you do not have one yet , you should go and upgrade  .

^_^  .

overall its a great product , so i very much reccomend it .

i've had 3 ipods so far and this one is the best i've had  .

i love the shape  .

it is easy to hold and is very cute  .

the only problems with it i've had is all the software updating i had to do  .

but otherwise i love everything about this model  .

i hated the square version  .

it is ugly but it did have a good screen to watch videos on  .

but this one also had a good screen  .

and i love the new cover flow option  .

it makes look for music very easy .

bottom line is it's a good product from apple and is another amazing ipod  .

people who's ipod freezed reset is menu and center at the same time for six seconds , the ability to play video is good for long car rides  .

games suck the battery away from your ipod but are fun  .

i also dropped it (yes i'm a klutz)and it did not show any dents or things like that  .

the screen also seems scratch proof (i said seems)  .

it is great , but the adds are all mouth and no trousers  .

what happened to the days when you could just press one button and hear beethoven  .

good to slap them 510 bay songs  .

this is my first ipod but not my first musical gadget  .

i am a gadget maven , i really love my electronics  .

just about everything i own plays mp3s so , why did i finally break down and buy an ipod  .

for all the other gadgets i can get for it , of course  .

why did i choose this ipod  .

16 gigs , sleek thin design , music , movies , tv , podcasts in this little thing , i am wowed  .

the one real drawback for me is that you could not turn off coverflow  .

if my ipod is in my armband and i wanted to turn up the volume the coverflow would be flipping a million miles an hour but the sound stayed the same  .

with the new software update 1  .

3 you can turn off coverflow and solve that problem i am really loving my new ipod and now i'm going to ask santa for the bose speaker system , the sony cd clock radio , and let's see what else do i need .

i've had my ipod for 2 days and i'm loving it , but i would say its just as cool as the other ipods  .

i like how thin it is but that just makes it more susceptible to getting lost because it weighs so little  .

i'm really dissapointed in the battery life  .

after playing a game for a mere 10 minutes the battery life turns red  .

after fully charging the ipod and then turning it on and scrolling through my music i noticed about a 1/4 notch dissapeared from the battery  .

over all it's a good product  .

well expected more than which it has  .

overall i miss my gen 3 which i misplaced  .

it is nice to listen to music while charging in docking station  .

this is not possible with this version  .

i like it cause it does have nice features but needs some fixin  .

it is not a problem for me to install the new itunes  .

but i do not like the info required for the genuis feature so i do not use it  .

i hate that no other chargers are compatible with this generation , making all my other accessories useless  .

did not have much of a learning curve in using the new product , although i still cannot seem to master the shake feature .

all though the 4th gen nano comes in a whopping 16gb , a full anodised body and a few extra funky features i still prefer the 3rd gen shape  .

why , because you dont need to turn the screen around to view a movie  .

also the short and fat design felt more comfortable and less suseptible to damage when carrying the nano in a tight jeans pocket or on the optional shoulder strap  .

i think the 3rd gen nano shape with 16gb capacity and full anodised colour aluminium casing would have been perfect .

overall , it's great  .

but if you get this ipod , plan on replacing the other accessories too  .

so it will cost you a pretty penny .

i've been using this nano for over a year now , and i'm really starting to get sick of it the audio quality is fine , provided you upgrade from the headphones that come with the nano  .

the screen is large and bright , but attracts fingerprints if i'm grabbing it  .

the battery life only lasts longer than four or five hours if i make the backlight turn off within five seconds of not touching it  .

the motion sensors are annoying when i need to run , but can be turned off  .

the circle's sensitivity is off , leaving me to either not move the cursor at all or to skip two songs ahead from what i intended  .

the fact that apple only allows support with itunes to transfer music onto the device is a hassle , as i use wmp to listen to all of my music on the pc , and i only buy cds (no digital distribution) if you want to be trendy and hop on the apple bandwagon , i suppose you can spend your money on this , but you can probably find a nicer product that actually has buttons and a battery that can last entire trips elsewhere .

i would not waste my money on this ipod updated  .

on aug 27 , 2009  .

device software has frozen twice in last four months ; menu wheel does not rotate as smoothly as previous generations ; not compatible with my bose docking station (purchased only 6 months ago) or my fm radio transmitter (purchased 2 years ago)  .

i also find the tilt sensitivity to be down right annoying       i'll be listening to a song and if i move my ipod the wrong way , it automatically skips to another random song .

poor design  .

dial is too sensitive  .

any little touch turns on the unit , even if it is in your pocket , and before you know it , the unit is out of power  .

also volume control is too sensitive .

just dont get it if you will use it for things that force you to be far away from so sort of charger  .

you want to use the product to listen to your music wherever you are  .

this nano is not compatible to accept a charge .

it's crappy  .

eurghhhhh .
