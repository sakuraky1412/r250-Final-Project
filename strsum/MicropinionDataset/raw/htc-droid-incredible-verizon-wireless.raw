Pros:. Runs applications very fast. Very good design : big screen, rubber made back makes good grip. Speakers run clear voice and sound. Android phone with so many apps availabe for download.. 
Cons:. Default alarm clock is missing vide setting. With WiFi and Explorer running atteries run down fast. Considering how thin / light this phone is it is still ok.. 
Summary:. Very good looking fast phone that would satisfy pro needs.. 

$$;
Pros:. There is way to much stuff on this phone to list all of the pros, but almost a flawless phone to make your friends jealous.. 
Cons:. The Built in camera app isn't very good at focusing, but there are camera apps in the app store that make up for it. no front facing camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sense UI. Quick. Responsive screen. Nice screen size. Camera. 
Cons:. Low battery life. 
Summary:. It is an amazing little phone. The sense UI is beautiful and not laggy at all. The only con I could find is the low battery life, but that is expected with how well it performs. Definitely worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well constructed, the user interface is easy to use. Has the ability to change the home screens to different scenes for social, work, travel to suit your preferences. Easy to connect to wifi and bluetooth. Strong call reception signal.3g works fine. 
Cons:. Many widgets running in background that are unused. Unable to permanently uninstall them. Using advanced task killer on Froyo (2.2) to stop these applications from running. Am not having problems with the battery as others have mentioned.. 
Summary:. The Incredible is a great product and the size is convenient to carry in your pocket or a holster. The sense user interface is intuitive and works flawlessly. I compared this product to the Droid x (very large) and the Samsung Fascinate and selected the Incredible for its ease of use. I have large hands and find it easy to type in landscape mode for messages. The scrolling feature and pinch to zoom or close works well on the web browser. I have the new SLCD screen instead of the amoled display and find it very sharp with good color and contrast. There is a favorites screen of your favorite contacts that make communicating easy whether by phone or email, etc. Well pleased with the product .. 

$$;
Pros:. The droid is easy to use and very handy, small and sleek and just darn pretty! The pics are great, and I'm constantly finding more and more useful apps.. 
Cons:. The camera flash is too bright - it whitens out most of the pictures when it's dark. I wish they made a case that would protect it from my drops.. 
Summary:. The phone was my first ever smart phone. The latest upgrade offers HotSpot capabilities which is great! I'm glad I have my droid!. 

$$;
Pros:. ITS OS ANDRIOD I LOVE IT. 
Cons:. it should have full qwerty keyboard. 
Summary:. this device is incredible good and have alot features of latest technology ...but have some back sides.from iphone. 

$$;
Pros:. 8 Megapixel Camera with 2 LEDs. Features of Froyo -ex: 3G hotspot, 720p, etc.. AMOLED screen (Originally designed that way). Call quality: Excellent!!. Google integration + Apps. No locked bootloader like Droid X. Lives up to it's name!. Superfast. HTC Sense. 
Cons:. The camera sticks out of the original backing poses a threat for camera lens damage. Battery life could be better, similar to any other high performance smart phone.. No 16GB + card included, not really an issue for me when you have 8GB on-board.. 
Summary:. Overall this phone has worked out extremely well for me and the fact that it is on Verizon Wireless. With this phone you have many CHOICES as customization, apps, and accessories. The design of the phone is great. Only thing I didn't like is that fact that the camera sticks out the back. But with the topographic design of back and the fact that it is removable, you can get a bigger battery that will protect the camera lens. The cases for this phone are great!. Another good thing about this phone is the AMOLED display and its pretty high resolution. It might not have that many pixels as the iPhone 4 but the colors and contrast are amazing, and it is a bigger screen in the same size package.. Call quality is one of the best I have heard. You cannot hear any hissing sounds and it is loud enough to hear anywhere. Speaker phone is great when need. + No dropped calls or "pocket calls" ever!. Removable memory and battery is a bonus, unlike the iPhone lacks. Phone is built solid even though it is thinner than the iPhones. HTC Sense is a simple and beautiful layover of Android when compared to other layovers such as annoying Moto Blur.. Battery life could be better, similar to any other high performance smart phone.. You can get extended battery packs for the phone, as big as you want (biggest size is 3500 mAh) due to the topographic design of the backing.. The backing of the phone is made of a scratch resistant rubberized material that feels good and protects the phone. If it gets damaged, you can replace it for very cheap.. The number of available apps might be less than that of an iPhone, but with the growth of Android Market, this will not be an issue for the time to come.. Currently you can root this phone, add custom roms, overclock it, etc.. You cannot do this with the newly released Droid X (except for root) , and the fact that it runs Moto Blur.. With the release of Froyo in late August, this phone is even more Incredible. It will run faster and have more features than before.. In conclusion it is:. Fantastic. Get one before stock runs out again. You will not be disappointed. And you have freeedom!. 

$$;
Pros:. With the update of the Android operating system, this phone performs smoothly and quickly. Ever since the update, I have not had a program crash. The screen is bright and very receptive to input. The battery life is more than adequate for my needs. 
Cons:. Before the update, there were some conflicts with some programs, most noticeably Pandora and the BBC applications. However, the phone performs very well now. The screen will need a protective cover to cover your investment.. 
Summary:. I have been very satisfied with this phone to date. It actually has surpassed my expectations wtih the recent update of the Android operating system. I own a MacBook Pro and with the program Doubletwist (freeware), I have downloaded the majority of my music libary to the additional microSD card (16 GB card cost me $50). The only other con I can see with this phone is the lack of standard memory (8 GB) which will likely require the purchase of an additional card. The camera is of fairly high quality so both pictures and video are clear and crisp. The only down-side the the camera is that slight movement of either the field or the camera itself will cause some blurring. This effect does not carry over to the video.. As for the Android operating system, it is quite intuitive and highly customizable. I have not been an Android user for very long so I cannot compare it to previous iterations. Many people might question my decision to use Verizon when I have already invested in Apple products. I prefer the concept of an open system more and the call quality of Verizon, especially in my area, is unparalled. As a final note, it was not difficult at all to transfer music and my calendar from my MacBook Pro to my phone. Transferring photos from my computer to my phone is somewhat more convulted, requiring a third party program (such as Picasa) to accomplish this.. 

$$;
Pros:. The size and screen clarity, very fast with the 2.2 Update. 
Cons:. battery life is shortened with extended internest, GPS use. 
Summary:. With the huge cell phones comming out this one is a perfect size for pocket use and can be easily handled. The bigger units are nice for screen size, but have become to big to be handled like a true cell phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast. Reliable. Easy to use apps. Awesome graphics. Makes me wonder how much I am going to need my laptop! Also acts as a mobile hot spot! One less wire to carry around. I am using it to write this review instead of my laptop. Get the picture?. 
Cons:. Way too addictive.. I thought at first the screen was too small (compared to the ego) but now I realize that if it were any larger it would be hard to carry around... in my pocket, case, etc.. 
Summary:. Fantastic. Get one. You will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great web integration, high performance, great GPS service. 
Cons:. Battery life, similar to any other high performance smartphone.. 
Summary:. The best phone I have come across, including when compared to the Droid X, Droid 2 and IPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, great network, not too big, like the evo. 
Cons:. shape pf the back panel, its a little busy, but it does stand out of the crowd. 
Summary:. After replacing my Storm, I do not envy any other phone on the market, this is the best combination of speed, apps, network, and price. They combine to create the best available. 

$$;
Pros:. Love HTC Sense (some may hate it or choose to go vanilla but personally I love it). Phone is very snappy even with 2.1. Have played with 2.2 and it's even more impressive. Love the customization and different scenes.. 
Cons:. Verizon discontinued the dock. Battery life. If you're smart with turning off 3g, wifi, gps, etc., you can make your phone last a long time. I can get a few days out of mine with the stock battery when only turning on needed radios at needed times.. 
Summary:. I love the phone and the OS. Sense has plenty of features and it's open to alot of things (especially if you root). Unlimited amounts of customization and there is always an app on the Market if I'm missing something. Rooting and installed custom ROMs is simple and it's fun to experiment with (Just remember to back up your data. Although Verizon supports the Droid 2/X more, I would highly recommend this phone. The Skin (HTC Sense) looks cleaner and more integrated and it's always Incredibly fast. Some things to look into if buying is an extended or extra battery.. 

$$;
Pros:. Aweome AMOLED screen display, much much better than LED. It does internet, email, and most other apps just like a laptop computer. Lightning fast processor. Has 3G and wifi, bluetooth, this phone has everything you need. Hundreds of downloadable apps. 
Cons:. none really. Verizon is slow to send the Froyo update, but who cares. phone works fine now.. 
Summary:. best phone i've ever had. I've had a blackberry curve and several Motorola phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast Phone. Fast Camera. Lots of memory. 
Cons:. Battery life - but that is to be expected of all smart phones!. 
Summary:. This phone rocks! It is really fast and I have not had a single problem with it so far (had it for three weeks now). I can only imagine how much faster it is going to be with the Froyo update.. I upgraded from the Eris and was considering the Droid X - but when I went to the store to look at it, I laughed at how huge that phone was - rediculous. If things keep progressing in that direction, we will all be holding up netbook sized phones to our ear (dumb...)!. The Incredible was named appropriately!. 

$$;
Pros:. does everything!. 
Cons:. None - the phone works exactly as I want it to.. 
Summary:. Buy It. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well with basic aps, dont need to download droid aps. Navigates easy.. 
Cons:. Touch pad keypad takes a bit to get used to, and battery life is not good. Extended battery fixed issue and getting used to touch keypad.. 
Summary:. no wonder still on backorder, good solid unit, and many phones this first really works well with the screen cover film.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use -- not being 'locked in' -- great connectivity -- looks great too -- HTC Sense doesn't get in the way. 
Cons:. installed battery lasts one-day max (if you're normal, you'll use apps and they eat power) -- I have the extended battery and will consider installing it if it looks like I can't get through the day. Needs 2.2 though --. 
Summary:. One of the best phones (smartphone included) on the market -- if not the best. It gets lots of comments on its looks and the HTC has done a great job on fit &#38; finish. Can't wait for 2.2 (perhaps within the next 2 weeks).... 

$$;
Pros:. This is the most useful and versatile smartphone bar none.. 
Cons:. None that I can find.. 
Summary:. This device does everything I need it to do and more. I find that I use my computer a lot less and my MP3 player, Kindle, and GPS have basically been gathering dust since I got my Incredible. Every day I find something new I can do with this device -- and best of all I can cold it any way I want and it makes incredibly good quality calls. I've never dropped a sincle call.. 

$$;
Pros:. much faster apps and most are free compared to my old G3. Very flexible and all but one app was free.. Bought one for $4.95 from G. Market and the same one on Apple store was $9.95. Guess the $5.00 additional went to Steve's pocket .. 
Cons:. None yet !. 
Summary:. Like the HTC google open operation system with all the flexibility. The 8mg pix camera replace me carrying around my Sony 10mg camera.. I use Google Premium Apps that auto sync my laptop, desktop and D-Inc to perfection for only $50.00 per year. Calender,contact and email using Outlook 2007.. 

$$;
Pros:. HTC Sense. Verizon. Android OS. Battery is not that bad. Large screen, but not too large. Fast, fast, fast. Size is great to hold and for the pocket. 
Cons:. Battery, but it's not bad if managed properly. I can get a day out of it with. Less than that with my old Hero.. 
Summary:. I have had this phone for about a month now and I think I can give it a pretty fair review. I came from the HTC Hero and EVO 4G.. Compared to the EVO my Incredible is managable. The EVO was entirely to large to hold, type on one-handed, and too big and bulky to put in the pocket. Compared to the Hero, uhmm, thats not even worth comparing too. The Hero is junk compareed to this phone.. Battery: I can get almost a full day out of this phone with moderate use. I am playing with this phone all the time. As long as you use Advanced Task Killer to manage the processes of the phone, and keep GPS and wi=fi off unless needed, the phone lasts just fine.. Screen: The screen can be a little hard to see in direct sunlight, but it definitely isnt a deal breaker by no means!! The screen is small enough to put in the pocket but large enough for my man-size fingers to type on. And not make any mistakes.. Speed: This phone is fast! The Snapdragon processor is great! Nothing more to say about that!. HTC: I find the HTC Sense to be suprior to Motorola Androus OS. But thats just me. And in a side-by-side comparison, The Incredible just seemed all around better than the X. The X is bigger than the EVO! If I want something that big I will bring my ipad along with me.. All-in-all, this is the nicest, fastest phone I have ever owned. And Verizon service seems just as good as the Sprint service I left to get this phone. Except Verizon costs a little more for the same features I got from Sprint. $33 more!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright screen. Great apps.. 
Cons:. HTC Facebook for Sense has a big problem by not allowing phone to go into standby. I reset the phone, omitting the Facebook setup and my battery lasts 3x as long.. 
Summary:. HTC Facebook for Sense has a big problem by not allowing phone to go into standby. I reset the phone, omitting the Facebook setup and my battery lasts 3x as long. Easily a full-day without recharging, which I could not do before. Check to see if Settings-Battery UP TIME and ACTIVE TIME are the same. If so, you have this problem. Afterward, the ACTIVE time is one-third of the UP time.. Music lacks bass response.. Updated. on Jul 30, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Scree/camera/apps/google sync with mail, contacts and calendar/7 home screens for easy access to programs, Google Sky, and on and on. 
Cons:. Can't think of any cons.. 
Summary:. Have not had issues with battery life...keep plugged in when at office, use car adapter when on the road, plus have a travel wall charger that keeps an extra battery charged and on hand at all times. Also have installed Juice Defender app which adds greatly to battery life. Plus, I have bothe ATT and Verizon accounts and the VZN network is a plus.. 

$$;
Pros:. So flexible and customizable. Fun! Very functional as a phone as well as a toy.. 
Cons:. Obviously hard to see the keyboard in the sunlight. 
Summary:. This is my first smart phone. I waited until my 2 year contract was up to get the extra $50 off and then I had to wait a little over 3 weeks to get it since they were on backorder. I had lots of second thoughts while waiting for it to ship. I had even been debating getting the iphone, since I love my ipod touch so much.. This was well worth the wait. The longer I have it the more I learn about it and the more I like. I use texting now, which I never did before, and I love checking email while on lunch break at work, and checking the news headlines or weather while on breaks. While waiting in doctors offices I play solitaire or read news headlines or whatever. Love it!. I bought a 1750 extended battery and never have any problems with battery life at all, (usually lasts 36 to 48 hours) though I'm not a "heavy user". I don't stream Pandora very often or play intense games on it, just light phone and texting use, and some use of the various apps during the day. I really recommend it and love the flexibility and endless ringtones and wallpapers and apps available for it. Not at all sorry I decided to get this instead of the iphone. Phone is clear and loud. Good reception.. 

$$;
Pros:. The snapdragon processor and half a gb of ram really make this phone fly through actions while having dozens of apps running in the background. I have never had any issues with reception and the call quality is phenomenal. Sense UI is a big plus.. 
Cons:. Its not fragile as I have dropped it many times, but construction and weight mimics cheap design.. 
Summary:. If you want the fastest android device to date and don't care to lug around a giant brick, this is your device. The web browsing and camera are my favorite workings of this device. This is by far the closest to desktop experience I have had in a mobile device and I have owned many windows mobile devices in the past. The froyo update for this device promises 3g wifi tethering and 720p video recording just like its big brother the Evo on sprint which makes this device near perfect. I don't do many games but flight control is fun and the screen is very sensitive and responsive for accurate mapping. Typing is as good or maybe a little better than iphone due to the slightly larger screen and accurate text prediction. Not to mention being able to speak in your text and emails is a literal life saver on the road. I have never had this device crash or freeze in the couple months that I've had it. I only turn it off to change the battery. HTC's great device building reputation does not suffer here as the incredible is a great representative of that.. 

$$;
Pros:. it is feature packed and offers a great battle against the iphone which is great. 
Cons:. i think that it is a little on the big side but that's it .. 
Summary:. i like this product because it's beautiful and functional. 

$$;
Pros:. Super FAST processor, 8 MP camera Voice search and voice texting, extremely customizable.. 
Cons:. Battery Life (But I brought an extend one and it the same size as original). ALSO what's up with NOT HAVING A MANUAL. Only phone I have EVER purchase that didn't come with one. (still gave it 5 Stars can't knock the phone but can knock HTC.. 
Summary:. This is my personal, I had my last phone for three years and after trying this phone and reading ALL the reviews, I was sold. My work phone is the HTC HD 2 from T-Mobile, and I have to say, VERIZON IS THE BEST service out there. I. 

$$;
Pros:. camera, download time, apps, complete intergration among features. 
Cons:. battery life at the beginning.You play with it to much. No desktop charger and car dock!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Pictures, Great Call Quality, Great Apps, Great FREE Stuff, Great Multitasking, Great Screen Quality, supports 32GB micro SD cards (despite Verizon saying otherwise). 
Cons:. Pics turn grainy sometimes, some apps kill the battery quick if left running in the background, needs a quicker or easier way to take a picture. 
Summary:. This is an excellent phone, with lots more features upcoming in the next OTA software update and FROYO. We will soon have 720 movie recorders, WiFi tethering and much more.. For Verizon, this is one of the best phones out there. The two main things you will be deciding if you want to get this is Screen Size and UI. The Motorola DROID X has the larger screen, but is it too large for normal pocket carrying? The Incredible has the HTC Sense user interface, while the DROID X has the Moto Blur interface. The Moto Blur UI, in my opinion, is inferior to the HTC Sense UI.. I personally wouldn't complain if I had either phone, but I am extremely happy with my DROID Incredible. Even things like call quality have not been an issue for me. I actually get compliments on how clearly things come through on there end. The DROID Incredible is my first experience in owning a Smart Device (if you don't count an iPod Touch), and I am glad I started here.. 

$$;
Pros:. incredibly fast browsing, fast apps downloads, outstanding GPS unit running Google maps, great signal reception, slim and attractive, tons of applications, 7 screens. 
Cons:. Short battery life but, if you know how to "suspend" most of the apps (with Appkiller software- free download) you will be able to extend battery life by 3/4. 
Summary:. I have own this phone from day one of it's release and it is great phone. In my opinion THE best Verizon smart phone by far! You can run many apps at the same time and in that aspect it clearly beats iPhone 3G S (not sure about iPhone 4) not to mention that it belongs to America's biggest network. I would highly recoment this phone to everybody. Thanks for reading. 

$$;
Pros:. HTC is cheaper and it doesn't have much anything except that is a product from another country. 
Cons:. Nothing to add here much except that this model has only more memory and everything else seems to be regular as Iphone. 
Summary:. HTC Droid Incredible (Verizon Wireless) is cheap which means it will have many users and still have the same style. We guess. But ordinary as Iphone. Updated. on Jul 16, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, app market, design, etc.. 
Cons:. Keyboard mistakes. 
Summary:. One of my favorite things about this phone is its speed. It can do everything I need (games, texts, phone-calls, email, facebook, etc.) without slowing down a bit. The phone LOOKS sexy. The keyboard doesn't give me many problems once I get used to it, and I can find my way around it quite easily.. Honestly, I can't think of anything I don't like about this phone right off the top of my head. Maybe the virtual keyboard makes me make some mistakes sometimes, but I have big hands.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) AMOLED High-Resolution Touchscreen. 2) 8 megapixel camera. 3) HTC Sense UI on top of Android 2.1 = One customizable device. 4) Live and interactive wallpapers. 5) I love the weather--the weather widget blows my socks off!!!! Very interactive!!!. 
Cons:. 1) Delayed ship time. 2)Battery life. 
Summary:. Overall, the HTC Droid Incredible is a very customizable and high-end device offering myriad ways to show that the Incredible is yours!!! The internet never could look better on a smartphone, thanks to the gorgeous display and 1 gigahertz processor. Ok, so the battery may not last as long as with some other smartphones but if you consider how much the Incredible offers, the battery life would not matter--just charge it every night before you go to bed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best all around smart phone that still fits in our pocket. It does everything.. 
Cons:. Dont use latitude locatable and you won have issues with battery life. This is my 3rd smart phone device this year and nothing comes close at reasonable size. My only grip is that the camera is a little better quality on the iphone.. 
Summary:. By far the best smart phone on the market with the best network. Verizon wake up and smell the roses, you need to produce more of this phone. Even Apple knows not everyone wants to carry a brick around in their pocket. (DROID, EVO, DROID X = HUGE!) MAKE MORE OF THIS PHONE. FOOLS..... The only mistake Verizon made is not having enough units available on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very snappy, Awsome Display, and has a great operating system in Google android!. 
Cons:. Not a very good media player. 
Summary:. I absolutely love this phone!!! i was waiting for the nexus one to come out on verizon but when i saw this phone i was sold on it right away! The 1 Ghz Processor is lightning quick and even when you have multiple apps running it really doesnt slow down much at all. I primarily bought it because i wanted the google maps gps... but i have discovered so much more i can do with this phone. It is very customizable so if you know a bit about computers and you like to play around and change settings and UIs this is definitely the right phone for you. I learn new stuff about it every day and absolutely could not be happier. 

$$;
Pros:. The Droid Incredible is super fast, looks awesome with it's unique design, and small enough to fit in my pocket. Picture quality is good enough to where I have no need to carry around my digital camera anymore. Phone calls are crystal clear.. 
Cons:. Battery life isn't as bad as people make it out to be but it could be better. Sometimes it reboots for no reason, it doesn't happen all the time but it is annoying when it does. Music app really sucks.. 
Summary:. If I had to do it all over again knowing about the new phones coming out I would, I don't see a phone out there that would make me want to trade my Incredible. With the new update coming out (2.2) my Droid is only becoming more Incredible! If your on Verison and you want the iPhone for Verison this is not it, it's way better!. 

$$;
Pros:. Being an iPod Touch user, I was able to adapt to this phone very quickly and easily, with only a slight learning curve. The email functionality is important to me, and being my first smart phone, I'm happy.. 
Cons:. Yes, the battery life is considerably less than I am accustomed to with my previous LG ENV2. I am also surprised by the level of the signal on this phone, I previously had no problem with full bars on my ENV2 in my house, but can only get 1 bar now.. 
Summary:. My previous phone, LG ENV2, has been my phone for the past 2 years. Because I am on the board of a non-profit, it is important that I am able to get my email on my phone. Frankly, the email experience on the ENV2 was a nightmare. Not feeling hopeful about the iPhone coming to Verizon anytime soon, I decided to go Android, and even with other Android phones to pick from, including the upcoming Droid X, I really wanted to go with the Incredible. The number 1 reason was the size. A co-worker in my office recently got an Evo, and I had to set up his office email on it. Nice, phone but just too big for me (felt like I had an iPad to my ear). The only downside with the size is the web browsing experience, and I can live with that.. The battery life is less than I'm used to, but based on my usage so far, I can get almost 2 days out of the phone (not much talk, low to moderate text, and moderate email and app usage). I use Advanced Task Killer for all but the most crucial apps, and I use it often. I also turned the brightness down slightly and turned off the haptic feedback on the home keys. These couple of settings dramatically increase the battery life and have not interfered with my usage of the phone features.. I haven't had the phone very long, so I haven't gotten to fully test my signal, but I was surprised by the fact that my LG ENV2 could get full bars inside my house, but this phone can only get 1 bar. I'm monitoring it carefully in case I have a defective phone, and so far, no dropped calls or reception problems. I'm away from my office on vacation, so I'll have a better chance to test it then.. Other than the "incredibly" (no pun intended) long wait for this phone and the poor and delayed response from Verizon when the phone was delayed well beyond what it should have been, I am very happy with this phone. My experience with Verizon customer service in that matter was mixed, and I almost canceled the phone order. However, I'm really glad I didn't. Having done some research and talking to other users, I really like the way HTC has handled Android compared to other manufacturers, especially with the interface. The phone is snappy and responsive, the screen looks great, the camera is easy to use, takes great shots (even in my house), and does everything I expect it to do. I knew it didn't get an CNET Editor's Choice for nothing!. I really recommend this phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Really fast, great apps, multitasking, 8mp camera!. 
Cons:. preloaded apps that you can't remove. 

$$;
Pros:. Very very fast OS. Web pages come up faster than my laptop. Everyday there is a new program, app, or upgrade to choose from.. 
Cons:. Its my wifes phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen is gorgeous, phone is super fast. talk to text works perfectly. battery life is great, excellent call quality. internet is blazing.. 
Cons:. it will not pair with alot of bluetooth devices. other than that have found no complaints. 
Summary:. the phone is amazing. the name suits it, incredible... my sister has the motorola droid and the incredible won every test i could think to put it through. i was hesitant on having no physical keyboard, but the touchscreen works so well.. you can do everything with this phone and more... you can customize it to exactly how you want.. 

$$;
Pros:. this is the next step in phones, fast, do not belive the negitives. Lots of Apps and Widgets, Camera is excellent and I'm a pro-photographer. Verizon wireless none better if you travel.. 
Cons:. NONE keyboard takes gettng use to and I have large fingers. limited Manuel so its a learning curve. 
Summary:. Get a life phone fans. Battery life is solved by cycling in 4 times when you get it (4 times) I get 3 days in use but I don't live by phone and seldon have to use WiFi. Oh must have APP killer. Outlook no problem just Sync as per instrustions. If your having issues its probably not the phone for you and maybe you first smart phone, I've had them all.. 

$$;
Pros:. very fast,does everything I'd want a smart phone to do..got tired of waiting for iphone on ver...no regrets. 
Cons:. battery life could be better, sometimes pinching to get larger fonts doesnt hold..keeps returning to small print... 
Summary:. best phone ive ever owned...easy to use and not to big..screen is great... 

$$;
Pros:. I upgraded from an LG Dare and the first thing that caught my eye was the web browsing experience. This phone is absolutely fantastic. The speed is awesome. I'm glad I decided to wait.. 
Cons:. Battery life seems a little short and I didn't like the wait...it took almost 3 weeks to get the phone.. 
Summary:. Go for it - you'll be glad you did.. 

$$;
Pros:. this phone has a more powerfull processor than my first computer and way more ram and that was my windows xp computer. the 8MP camera is amazing. ever since i got the phone i have had so much luck and have taken many amazing pictures.. 
Cons:. The battery can run out quickly but if you understand how different things like network usage affects the battery life then you can extend its life for a long period of time.. 

$$;
Pros:. The snapdragon processor is crazy fast. You can scroll with your finger as fast as you want and the processor will keep up. The crisp display is one of the best I've ever seen. HTC sense combined with Android 2.1 is a match made in heaven.. 
Cons:. Hmmm.. if there is anything to gripe about its the battery. Yes I run ATK and I check it often. Even so it still seems like they could of done more with it. But given how much power is inside I'm still giving 5 stars!. 
Summary:. I love my Incredible. I agree with CNET in the fact that Verizon's service puts this phone over the iPhone with at&#38;t's questionable service. The calls are very clear even with the speaker on. The 8.0 mega pixel camera is a nice added feature that I can easily e-mail pictures or upload them to Facebook. HTC sense has tons of customizable features to make this phone your own. The android market has fewer apps but there are several FREE apps that you would never find with the app store. The Snapdragon processor is blazing fast. I dare say it will pull up a webpage almost as fast as your laptop. This has tons of small features that most don't know about. Ie: you can touch and hold your finger on a word or phrase like on a webpage or e-mail and you will have a few options like cut n paste. But you can also search the word quickly in googles dictionary or translate it for you in several different languages. The speech to text works perfectly almost every time. You can even complete a web search by speaking into the phone. Now that they announced iPhone 4 from what I have read I'd still rather have my Incredible.

Pros:. Too many to state. Just an incredible phone. Whatever you don't like about it; you can overcome it with downloading an app to fix it.. 
Cons:. Battery life is not all that great, but not really the phone's fault. It's just doing so many things (multi-tasking) at once. The OS Android is always doing something. There are apps available to help with this.. 
Summary:. The Verizon Wireless Droid Incredible really lives up to its name. There is just so much you can do with it. Every week I discover a new way to use it. Because I am a Verizon customer, I don't have an iPhone, but I have a iPod Touch that I love also. But since I bought the Droid Incredible, I have yet to use my iPod Touch.. 

$$;
Pros:. this phone is the perfect phone for hd enthusiasts and geeks everywhere. It is almost completely flawless and without a doubt deserves a place above the latest iphone.. 
Cons:. The only complaint iv heard from other people is that the os is too hard to use. Buy if your reading this review then you are smart enough to use the os. And the battery life isnt as good as I had hoped but its enough to get you through the day.. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface, wi-fi, screen resolution, camera, multitasking, widgets, live wallpapers, voice input, free navigation, integration with Google, Verizon network, scenes configuration. 
Cons:. Battery life, Facebook app, entire back half of the phone comes off when opening it up. 
Summary:. This phone it's at or above every other smartphone on the market today. It competes well with the iPhone, BlackBerry phones, Palm devices, and even the Evo (too big in my opinion.) It really lives up to the "Droid Does" slogan and would encourage anyone to check it out when shopping for a new phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. I feel like I stole this phone off of a secret governmental gadget project. It seems ahead of technology. The Web Browsing is super snappy. Pages load as quick as my new laptop.I feel privileged to own this piece of technology.. 
Cons:. I didnt get it the first day it came out. 
Summary:. Durable pocket device that seems like NASA had its hands on. So much to do on it that ill be entertained for years to come. I did a lot of research on phones and picked the right one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fastest phone out there, very responsive and faster than the iPad. Awesome games, google earth, google maps, etc.. 
Cons:. needs some metal. 
Summary:. First this phone had widgets, widgets are very useful and creative. iPhone does not have widgets, also this phone can do awesome video streams, iPhone and iPad can't.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's very fast.. 
Cons:. None. It's a rechargeable device obviously the battery will never last long enough.. 
Summary:. Having never owned a smart phone before i decided to take the plunge with this one because it had everything i wanted. I know i made a great purchase because my wife enjoys using it. She is not very tech savey. Everyday i learn some new exciting thing the phone is capable of doing. There is a bit of a learning curve with it but with a little time you get easily acclimated to the phone and it's features.. 

$$;
Pros:. I think everyone will agree that this phone, based on performance, features, support (Adobe flash, mini sd card, etc...) is the best smart phone on the market today.. This being said, do not be ignorant when leaving reviews!. 
Cons:. None - anyone foolish enough to complain about battery life must not realize that this phone allows users to swap out batteries (without destroying the phone). 
Summary:. I believe it is only fair to compare this smart phone (apples to apples) with the 2nd best smart phone available - The iPhone.. If not, you mine as well compare it to Dell Laptop! If you don't understand this reference, perhaps you should stick to owning a Motorola Flip Phone.. Anyone can speculate on what may be released in the future, who knows, one day we may be able to communicate telepathically?. Until a smart phone is released and for sale to the general public it is not fair to even bring it up.. If your at all like me, and must own the latest and greatest technologies, I am sure you will agree with my review.. If your ignorant, or naive, then you should not share your opinions -. "It is better to be thought a fool, than to write a review and remove all doubt!". 

$$;
Pros:. Everything, great scree, runs lightning fast, great camera, great web, great functionablity as a work phone. 
Cons:. Nothing at all. 
Summary:. The phone is just incredible, it truly is. I see some people complaining about the battery life but it works just as long as all other smart phones I have owned before (Palm, Blackberry, Etc). Just a fantastic phone, if you have any doubt ...don't the thing is great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen quality. Very initiative Navigation,. Full GPS with turn-by-turn. Full voice integration that works. Lots of cool apps that really integrate with the phone (unlike iphone).. Widgets - better then apps. 
Cons:. I like the phone so much that it?s hard to think of something to complain about. The battery isn?t as good as blackberry. Enough for a full day for my usage. The screen is not great in sunlight. A little bit of a leaning curve (but worth it).. 
Summary:. If you want a really cool phone with tons of features and you don?t need to have your email delivered to you every 2 seconds then you might love it like me. I don?t pay attention to bars but call quality is good and I haven?t dropped a call.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1 GHz processor. Best voice recognition software Ive ever seen. Customization, not tied down to any software. Verizon 3G = fast. Convienent 8MP camera on phone+decent quality = can replace digital camera. 8 gigs internal storage+ 16 gig micro SD card. 
Cons:. Android learning curve is a bit more than iPhone OS. Sometimes u can customize too much and simple tasks become frustrating. Media player is terrible, Android Market offers alternatives for free. BATTERY LIFE!! needs a 1500mAh OEM battery. 
Summary:. First things first, it has the best voice recognition software Ive ever seen and when paired with Google everything.... it makes life much simpler. Ive reduced the amount of text I have to input in text fields by 50%, all you have to do is speak what you want to type and it is accurate 90% of the time (depending on background noise of course). I can get a full voiced turn-by-turn directions in about 20 seconds flat just by using the voice input, instead of opening up the maps app and then typing my destination or searching first then selecting it. My Tom Tom car GPS is now completely obsolete.. OS: This phone is for people who are a bit more tech savvy and care about how/why a phone can do what it does. The Android OS is a bit more complex than the iPhone OS, but this is mostly due to the amount of customization available. The HTC Sense UI alleviates some of this with a unified inbox, friend stream, widgets, etc. The best part about this phone is that if you dont like something about the OS, there is usually a way to change it. Also, IF YOU DONT HAVE iTUNES or DONT LIKE iTUNES, YOU CAN STILL USE THE PHONE! Although the stock HTC and Android media players are not very good, you can download better players for free. There are syncing software out there that can help transfer music, movies, pics, docs, etc, but you can still mount the phone as an external HD and use the old drag'n'drop method to transfer anything you want. HTC Sense has plenty of useful widgets that can eliminate digging through menus, etc. and there are always more on the Android Market. Also, dont worry about how many Apps are available compared to the iTunes store..... there are plenty of good, free apps to download and besides how many do you really need? of the 100,000+ apps, probably only 40% are actually decent enough to download and of that 40%, how many do YOU actually need? Quality should be paramount over quantity. Hardware: As usual, the phone hardware is tops in the market right now, but will be surpassed in the near future. Its just the nature of the cell phone industry. Dont worry about other phones coming out w/ better specs, etc. The Incredible has enough RAM, processing speed, camera quality, touch sensivity, call quality, signal reception, and style to last you through a 2 year contract.... and by then, another awesome HTC phone will be available. Pop in a 16 gig micro SD card and you have 24 gigs of total storage. The processor is pretty fast, and it helps when "multi-taksing". I use quotations because most people dont intend to "multi-task" but do so inadvertently, i.e. listening to music while playing a game, then you get an email and check that. Then you go to the web browser to look up something, and finally you ask to navigate to an address. So far you just opened up the 1) music player 2) email client 3) web browser 4) Google Maps 5) Google Navigator. UNFORTUNATELY, all those applications will stay open until you close them (sucking up battery) so you need to download a free AppKiller that can close things once youre donr with them. But still, with 5 or more applications open, the phone does not slow down because of the 1 GHz processor.. Style: The form factor is great. Some dont like the rubbery &#38; topographic battery cover, but I say it helps hold onto the device and prevents it from sliding when placed on inclined surfaces (car dashboard, couch, your lap, etc ). The display is amazing, has one of the top resolutions out there, but washes out in direct sunlight. The phone is just as thin as an iPhone and the optical trackball is actually useful. SERIOUSLY, people frown at extra physical buttons on the front face, but the 1) Home 2) Back 3) Menu 4) Optical trackball are time savers and MORE IMPORTANTLY fingerprint eliminators. If you can reduce the amount of finger swipes you have to make in order to perform a simple task, it helps reduce smudging up the beautiful screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed. Ease of use. Flexibility. Screen clarity. 
Cons:. Haven't figured out how to get my Apple Lossless iTunes onto phone. Should be easy.. I thought it would save me time...no...I spend hours dinking with it because it is fun...kind of addicting.. 
Summary:. Impressive. Friendly. Cool tool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast, Great Software, Nice Design, Fantastic display. 
Cons:. none really - battery life is the only draw back but acceptable for such an incredible phone. 
Summary:. I turned in my Moto Droid when the HTC Incredible fell into my lap and I couldn't be happier. The Incredible blows away my Moto Droid. It is much, much faster. There is no lag time switching between screens. The display color and intensity is, well, incredible. My download speeds for web browsing are phenomenal to the point that when I show friends they are stunned. It is almost as fast as my wired cable connection on my PC. The build quality of the phone is very good. It has a nice weight without being too heavy. My Moto Droid was so heavy that if I threw it at your head I could kill you.. The other major selling point for me is the HTC Sense software. It makes the android experience much better. Everything is more seamless and flows really well. The Sense software has great widgets - from Email to calendar and weather it is far superior to the Motorola product. If there is a down side it is battery life....the charge doesn't last more than 6-8 hours with moderate use. This is minor to me considering all of the functions of this phone and should be expected with heavy 3G use. All being said, this is probably the best Android phone currently available. I can't wait to see what comes next!. 

$$;
Pros:. -Great Screen. -Straight forward interface. -Responsive. 
Cons:. -Touch buttons on home screen lighting seem fairly mis-directed. 
Summary:. The best device on the market to include I-Phone. I've used each extensively and this is the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Verizon network. 'nuff said. But for those wanting more... IPhone is an IPod with text, as the phone and service suck. This is a phone that works and does cool stuff.. 
Cons:. Battery life is not better or worse than IPhone.. 
Summary:. Awesome. Got mine at www.wireless.sasmaso.com for cheaper than Verizon's own website.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen, Android, Network connection, Sound Quality, build quality. 
Cons:. Not perfect battery life. 
Summary:. This is the best phone Verizon has ever released. The difference in usefulness between this and the Droid by Moto is night and day. All of my Iphone owning friends are jealous. The perfect phone!. Read more here: http://www.crappytechreviews.com/2010/05/verizon-droid-incredible-hardware.html. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast. No, REALLY fast!. Intuitive. None of that 3 day learning curve stuff.. Does everything and then some. Way cool.. 
Cons:. Took so darn long to come to market.. Wish the sync between Outlook and Android wasn't held hostage by MS and Google's "love" for each other.. 
Summary:. Bought a Palm Pre Plus in January and really wanted it to work. Everything on it was great except the POS keyboard. So bad I tossed it and went for the Droid Incredible. A little concerned because of the comments about battery life, camera, etc. I didn't find any shortmings with the Incredible. It is at least as good as the hype and most importantly, the learning curve was about 3 or 4 hours to be competently functional. Can't say enough positive about this phone. Use CompanionLink USB to synch and it's wonderful (a plug for their support team).. Couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything! Had a blackberry before - was not impressed with RIM's current phones. This phone is absolutely Incredible. From free applications, super fast, love the pinch &#38; don't need my Ipod anymore! Free Pandora!. 
Cons:. short battery life!. 
Summary:. Incredible takes Android to a new level. Watch out Mac &#38; MSFT - Android is here!. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Web browsing, Camera, Style, Verizon. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. Amazing phone, the call quality is amazing and the web browsing is really fast and responsive. Had an iphone and jumped ship and couldnt be happier. I really think this is the official iphone killer.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Multitasking Galore!. - Tons of great apps, something for everyone. - Responsive touchscreen. 
Cons:. Battery Life - Not horrible, but the extended battery will be out by the end of the month and that will make this phone unstoppable.. 
Summary:. It may take a little while to learn about everything this phone can do, but once you get the hang of it it really is Incredible! I had an LG Dare and was worried about only having a touchscreen again, but the Incredible's HTC Sense UI is amazing, lIghtyears ahead of the older touchscreens.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Incredible has the power and hardware needed to support any leading edge connectivity app out there. I have been stunned my purchase.. All the supplies apps are good, some are great, being able to voice search is a big plus.Camera is very good.. 
Cons:. The back is a little flimsy if you plan on replacing batteries often I upgraded to a 1500mah immediately to improve on the 1300 supplied. If you stay away from lots of camera use, the largest battery hog in the unit. Display issue of signal strength.. 
Summary:. I have had at least 10 different varieties of smartphones in the last 7 years. I think the overall capabilities, speed power and sound quality and is excellent with no dropped calls, I have no issues making it all day without a battery charge, and that is with plenty of browsing and other use, that would normally burn up battery (beware of lots of camera use). I have noted, and read many threads on the lower than normal bar display that seems to be bothering people, I too have that issue, with a 2-3 bar instead of 4 bar reading, when my other phones would diplay maxed out signal, but no sound quality issues, or dropped calls, So this must be a display issue, as the real bottom line is the signal strength is -dBm not "bars", and since this is always great, I have been ignoring "bars" I would expect an OTA update to come out soon to sync the bars with the real signal strength. The apps available are great, but as a IPad and Ipod owner I miss the depth of applications and especially games, I hope with the new phones available for this platform the application base will grow exponentially as the Apple segment has. I wish the people that are complaining about call quality would talk to Verizon and verify if they actually have a defective phone or quit posting to make this phone look bad, because there are way too many happy people with this phone's call quality for it to be a "problem design" I do suspect there are folks trying to bring down the rating of this phone because they love the competition (Iphone) and may not even have one of these. Even my wife who doesn't like techie phones fell on love with this one. The ease of integration with social networking apps, great Google built in and HTC apps and the super fast internet capabilities pushes this over the top. HTC/Verizon,it's about time.. All in all the phone is the best smart phone I have ever used.. 

$$;
Pros:. FREE modem for laptop when no wifi. Fast. Many good free apps. Nice GPS &#38; Voice recognition. Integration with Outlook, FaceBook, Twitter, Pandora, Rhapsody, Grooveshark, etc. Minimal mis-keyboarding. Good pinch zoom. Multiple home screens.. 
Cons:. Battery life seems a bit short. No LED flashlight app yet. Easy to accidentally change volume just holding phone. iTunes integration not great yet. So customizable that it'll take a while to tweak to your needs so longer learning curve than iPhone.. 
Summary:. I haven't had it long enough to give a full review but, so far, it pretty much lives up to all my expectations! The more I use it, the more I find it can do AND there's a constant stream of new apps and upgrades (PC access is coming soon).. Two thumbs up - cuz I keyboard with my index finger ;-). 

$$;
Pros:. -Camera (once you learn to use it). -Speed. -Overall responsiveness. -HTC Sense: Truly improves the Android experience. -Any and all google features/programs/apps. -Size/Build. -Sound quality. 
Cons:. -Camera:It is a bit sensitive to movement and low lighting. Learn to keep very still when snapping a shot. And learn to play with your ISO and pre-shot settings when in a dark room. I also wish it had a side mounted camera button. But no big deal.. 
Summary:. I love my Moto Droid. But even my rooted Moto OC'd to 1ghz doesn't match the speed and fluidity of the INC. I will tackle some common Con-listings. Battery life. 95% of people who complain of battery suckage are running EVERYTHING fullforce, full time. Tip: Use the power management widget. If you are not using GPS, turn it off. If you are not using WIFI turn it off. So on and so forth. Tip...go into your main settings and uncheck Gmail calendar and contacts Sync, leave the mail. You can still sync these as you need them manually. Tip...turn your brightness down. Doing this alone will give you at least an extra 3 hours of battery. Tip...download ATK. Enough said. Tip...get an extended battery. Tip...download Screebl. Some debate as to its effectiveness, but I am certain it improves my battery time.. Even on the stock battery, doing all of these took me from roughly 10 hours worth of battery to almost a day and a half of pretty consistent usage. Try it. You might be surprised.. Here is another peeve of mine. Many people complain of the signal bars, yet they don't actually complain that they drop calls or lose speed. Amount of signal bars for ANY phone by no means indicates actual quality of service. It is more or less a "ballpark" estimate. I have my Moto Droid and INC activated on two different lines and comparing the actual DbM in the settings menu reveals nearly the same measurements for both.. Web browsing on this phone is amazing. Flash 4.0 comes preinstalled, and will be upgraded to 10.1 once it is released and formatted for the device.. Overall, I switched to this phone from my Moto because I LOVE the Android platform. But the HTC sense, with its added functionality and widgets, is what polishes it all up for me and gives me an even MORE pleasurable experience. I thought I would miss the keyboard on my Moto, but I don't. I thought I would miss that solid metal build of my Moto, but the INC has a great feel to it (no, not "too plasticy" by any means). I will be in this phone for quite some time. Good stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. You can read about these in reviews on the internet.. 
Cons:. None what so ever.. 
Summary:. People have complained about the battery life and I am completely baffled by this. Granted, I am not talking to people all day long on my phone but with a few 30-40 min conversations and messing around with the phone throughout the day has left me with about 50% charge. This is my first smartphone so I have been messing around with it the past few days and the battery has not been an issue. I would recommend this to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blazingly fast. Responsive screen. Exceptional call quality &#38; Speaker. Thousands of apps. Beautiful Display. 
Cons:. It's a smart phone, so the battery could be better. Extended battery is coming!. 
Summary:. I bought this phone the day it came out, and have put it through the mill! I have yet to stop playing with this phone. Browser, E mail, messaging are exceptional. The phone is faster than my laptop. The call strength sometimes reads 1 bar, however I have Never dropped a call. I just drove through some canyons in So. California, as an ultimate test. Again, I did not drop a call and that is saying something!. Listen to music, while browsing the web, answer an e mail, than send a text, with no lag what so ever.. Simply amazing phone, unbelievably functional for anything you could do, or consider doing. Wi-Fi, &#38; 3G are very powerful, and there is absolutely No lag even with several apps open. Battery life? It?s a smart phone, of course the battery life is not good; however there is an extended life battery which will take care of that. Absolutely the most ?Incredible? piece of technology in the wireless phone industry. Exceptional phone!. Updated. on May 18, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Everthing! It's sleek, fast, thin,. call quality is unparallelled, screen is awesome, etc. It's Incredible! They picked a good name for this phone!. 
Cons:. I sometimes miss my hardware keyboard, but I'm getting along nicely without it.. 
Summary:. They named it aptly, Incredible. My first Android phone (coming from Windows Mobile 6.5 Touch Pro 2) and I love it! Haven't missed my Touch Pro 2 at all! I would highly recomment this phone to any serious smartphone users, if you can get your hands on one.... 

$$;
Pros:. Incredibly fast device, No phone faster. Screen is beautiful and all the possibilities through apps and programs are really endless.. 
Cons:. Honestly, my only complaint is that the snap on case that I bought with it does not snap on all the way. Thats an easy fix(replace the case) the battery is not bad at all as long as you manage your apps well and tell programs not to push too often.. 
Summary:. Really powerful phone. Can't think of another device that can hold a candle to it. Strongly recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Call quality. Personalization. Integration. 
Cons:. Wish is synced with iTunes easier. 
Summary:. I'm thrilled to have the Incredible. I was turning blue waiting for the iPhone on Verizon, the annual rumors became tiring. Apple waited to long.. 

$$;
Pros:. Takes a while to understand. Take it slow, were not stupid, it's a lot of stuff to learn. 
Cons:. The lid and and the port are flimsy.. 
Summary:. I like giving Apple a run for their money. The Incredible does that. My experience has been a delight.. 

$$;
Pros:. Muti-task on top of muti-task... This phone will update your social accounts all will listening to a song an checking you email all at the same time. Show me an iPhone that can do that. Its also just a well made phone, completely customizable.... 
Cons:. Battery life...... its a smartphone.... need i say more..... 
Summary:. This phone is well made super fast and doesn't stall like the other smartphones out there. No phone can top this phone right now... not even the iPhone.... 

$$;
Pros:. I like everything, including how fast it is. 
Cons:. Lack of a User's Manual. 
Summary:. Being in marketing I thought HTC's product name, Incredible, was a poor choice. I have now used the phone for 5 days and it is truely incredible! I am still learning all the functions, and playing with various downloaded apps, but so far I am most impressed with it. The most impressive thing about the phone though is it is just flat fast. Huge speed advantage over my previous smart phone. With so many apps to select from the people in my office are tired of me gee whizzing as I try a new app. There are just too many good things about this phone to list. Bottom line, best phone purchase I have ever made and it is on a superior network.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything works great. Downloaded tons of apps and no blue screen of death.. 
Cons:. Nothing so far.. 
Summary:. I was able to get mine last Thursday and can not put it down. My first smartphone. Really impressive and INCREDIBLE!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. (You thought I was gonna say incredible). Anyway, this phone will beat the pants off of its competitors. Reception is amazing. Screen, gorgeous. Touch screen, extra responsive.. HTC Sense is beastly.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better. Google Earth and Amazon MP3 store are not in the market. You need to download the .apk manually.. 
Summary:. This product has pretty much been the best gadget I have ever own. It is open, easy to use, and is wonderful to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Talk and surf with any WiFi connection (which to me is a good compromise). 2. The 3.7" screen looks great. 3. Can handle antying I throw at it.. 4. Flash (Apple if you had it I would be an iphone user). 5. The Verizon 3g network is awesome. 
Cons:. 1.battery life. 2. screen a little too bright in dark room. 3. Can't see screen in direct sun light. 4. Not a fan of the charging port.(hard to plug in charger). 
Summary:. With the Android operating system and HTC's sense UI, this phone is just what the doctor ordered. It handles any program easily. Plus with the never mentioned option of talk and surf, by way of wifi, I humbly say screw you Apple, enjoy verizons's expansive coverage, and say good bye to ATT's dropped calls, pathetic 3g, and crappy edge service. Did I mention flash support. Now I can actually watch videos without clicking on a YouTube app or trying to hack and brick. Lastly, android is a heck of lot more open. So I don't feel like a convict on the run from the anal apple police. I won't say this phone is the best phone ever. It still has moments that it does something crazy.(like randomly turning on Pandora will I'm taking a leak). And let's face it, the battery isn't what I expected with a 1ghz snapdragon processor. Still, this phone is the best phone I've ever owned and I have high hopes for the things that are to come. With small tweaks and updates, this will be a big contender for a long time. HTC.......good job. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Size, Weight,. 
Cons:. Media Syncing. No explanation of HTC Sync in the manual. Battery could be better but all Smartphones eat up power depending on how you use it. Download Advanced Task Killer and use it. My phone last for about two days with low to moderate use.. 
Summary:. Bottom line for all of you IPhone users is go into a Verizon store and just try it out. Appreciate it for what it is and try not to compare it to your IPhone but if you do I doubt you could honestly say that the IPhone is a better Unit. The HTC Incredible allows for complete user customization and sure it may not have hundreds of thousands of apps but it has all the ones that most Iphone users use and the market hasn't been around that long. Developers are catching up and Android versions of your Apps are on the way if they aren't already there.. I have been waiting for Verizon to come out with a great Smartphone for a LONG time. I thought that the Iphone would be the one but when Android systems came out on Verizon I wasn't so sure if Apple would get my money. I was excited when the Moto Droid came out but even more excited by the HTC Eris which received almost no advertisement. I didn't like the slide out QWERTY for MOTO so considered getting its cousin. That is until word of the Nexus One came out. I was ready to buy that until HTC announced the Droid Incredible. I came into my Verizon Store at 8:00 on April 29th and immediately bought the Incredible. It is SO fast and HTC Sense makes customization easy. I have shown the phone to several people in my office who have IPhones and they almost all are ready to make the jump. One thing that keeps them happy with the IPhone though is how it links with ITunes. I don't really use ITunes so this didn't bother me but I did find Syncing Media on the Incredible confusing. Nothing was in the manual about how to do it and I had to do a Google search to figure it out. Even then I haven't downloaded the program from HTC because a version for the Incredible doesn't exist. I called HTC and they said I can use the HTC Eris version instead.. As far as the battery goes it all depends on how you use it. I have gotten two days of usage out of it so far between each charge but I don't use it overly much. I am not complaining about it though because almost every IPhone user I know charges their phone every night.. 

$$;
Pros:. *screen size. *touch screen is very responsive. *speed of the phone. *quality build. *Android marketplace. *verizon communications. *ah hell everything!. 
Cons:. nothing so far. 
Summary:. i have had many phones in my time. but this is only my second smart phone. i came from the BB Storm. i liked that phone at first but got real tired real fast with it. the Incredible is something fresh, fast and just Incredible...pun intended. if you are in the market for a new phone. then look no further. best phone on the market to date.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.1. 8MP Camera. Sense UI. 1 GHz proc. (lightning fast). App Market. 
Cons:. Battery Life (1300 mAh Come on HTC). The body could have been better.. 
Summary:. I'm another one of those guys that never submit reviews. But I have to give this device praise. Pound for pound, this is the BEST smart phone I have ever owned. Here is my phone evolution: Motorola (That is from when I started caring about the device I carried) v60p which I still have, LG enV, Samsung sch-i760 (my favorite), vx6800 (What a brick!).. The body could have been better. But this isn't bad at all. I got the black shell case from Verizon plus the ZAGG invisible shield and I'm good to go. Google has slipped up by not letting the Nexus 1 hit Verizon's stores. This phone has it beat head and shoulders.. Battery life is mediocre. But that's mediocre for MY tastes. I would call my self a power user that has all the bell and whistles an signals on all the time. I text ALOT. I'm on the net ALOT, I use the GPS ALOT. I run my mouth on the phone ALOT. Your results may vary. But hey there is a 1750mAh battery out there for 50 bucks that solves this problem. And if your on a budget (like the cost of this phone left you broke), a cheaper alternative can be had on eBay (2x 1500mAh batteries plus desk charger). Under 15 bucks to your doorstep! There are even rumors of a 3500mAh battery. Similar to the one for the Eris.. If your are on Verizon already and are due for your "New Every Two" Upgrade, your getting a banging deal on the phone ($99 "150 with taxes").. Using an Android device is taking some getting used to. But that is only because I am used to the previous limits of smart phones (former win mobile prisoner). Every day I have an Ah ha! moment with this phone. If you want to stay connected to your digital world, then this device is your leash. Even you CrackBerry users may be swayed by this one. It even supports an Exchange Server. Flawlessly I might add. I'm content with the fact that I waited and bypassed other devices for this phone (read: droid milestone, Storm2).. Getting over my need for a keyboard is hard. Yes I have fairly big fingers. But I can type on this device faster than I could with my LG enV (by leaps and bounds) and accurately to boot because of the predictive corrections it makes for me. And if you don't like that, it has the Voice to Text feature nailed. Seriously, let this be the review that makes you pull the trigger on this phone. I almost don't want to tell anyone. Like its my secret so I will be the only cool kid on the block. While the rest wait for the newest CrackBerry or IPhone. Even If/when Verizon gets an iPhone, this device will make an iPhone on Big Red seem like an squirt in the bucket.. Here is the skinny. In need of a new smart phone/business device?. GET THIS PHONE NOW. You will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Versatile, Fast, User friendly, all the bells and whistles. 
Cons:. Some features are not apparent almost hidden. 
Summary:. The Best phone on the Market!. 

$$;
Pros:. snappy speed, slick UI, robust app store, expandable memory, you can access the battery, its on the Verizon network.. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. having used both phones it out iphones the iphone. its lighter, quicker, and it just does more than the iphone while doing it on the best network.. 

$$;
Pros:. I just got mine and its the best, yes I only have 1 or 2 bars but I haven't lost a call. 
Cons:. battery does stink but I can live with that. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size. Screen resolution. Vivid colors. Touch sensitivity. Battery life. Call quality. Sound quality. App availability. Ruggedness. Android OS 2.1. Sense UI. 1 GHz Snapdragon CPU. 
Cons:. No data/voice at the same time, but that's a Verizon problem. 
Summary:. I have had this phone since launch day and am extremely impressed. I have used many phones in the past, including the coveted iPhone, but this blows them all out of the water. I am a long-standing Mac user, and love all Apple products, but when something is better you just have to accept it. This phone is incredibly fast, fun and easy-to-use. The Sense UI is such a pleasure to use, and is much better than the standard Google Experience in my opinion. The speed of this phone is just unparalleled. It just flies. The battery life is actually much better than I expected, as I use apps all day from Pandora playing in the background while I use Navigation to find my way around, to watching a movie while I work out, or listening to my tunes while I play a game. It has so far lasted me a whole day's worth of content and I am pleased with that. The HTC Flash add-on is great for using some flash content, but unfortunately not all. The new "leap" feature is very handy and reminds me of Expose on my Macs, which I use frequently. It has just been an extremely pleasant experience so far and I look forward to holding onto this phone for some time. Especially with how unimpressive iPhone OS 4 is looking so far. I also tested the 3G speed here in central MN, where there is no AT&#38;T 3G, and a Spring MiFi was pulling 1.4 Mbps and this beast was getting 2.4 Mbps in the exact same spot. Can't complain. If you are on Verizon, or even if you are with another provider, and want the best phone to date, get out and get yourself an HTC Droid Incredible, you won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. pure awesomeness and trumps current iphone on every single level. Next Iphone however will be a better competitor with front facing camera and faster processor.. but still this phone rocks. CNET needs to filter some of the BS reviews.... 
Cons:. Pictures although 8 mp is still a bit grainy. Need an app/customization so the photo is taken by touchscreen or volume rocker. Center button causes phone to move when taking pics = blurry pics.. 
Summary:. For those complaining about low battery life, I bet you have opened several apps... and didn't fully close out of them. Mine had all my apps running at once (unknowingly) and battery life was 4 hrs. If you run Advanced Task Killer, you can close your instances of apps... read the manual. Batt life is much better now.. 

$$;
Pros:. highly customizable, micro sd card expansion, google voice searching,. 
Cons:. battery could last longer but thats with all smartphones...about 14 hours under moderate usage. 
Summary:. great phone, definitely the best on verizon and maybe the best period...love it. 

$$;
Pros:. Blazing fast, intuitive, customizable. I didnt think i would care about the ability to have 7 home screens. but its great! Excellent browsing capability. Touchscreen is perfect. The resolution on the screen is stunning.. 
Cons:. I'll write battery life, but all smartphones eat batteries.. 
Summary:. I love this phone. i walked into VZW to get my girfriend a new phone, and i walked out with a new one too. The DROID incredible is one of those products that you must experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast..with tons of flexibility.... multiple home pages for easy access to email, contacts and calendar..... Just a great product out of the box!!!. 
Cons:. Even with an app killer, the battery is is the only weak link so far.... 
Summary:. I have sat on the sidelines for years waiting for a phone that would be a pocket size computer. This is it. In a matter of minutes I had set up my Google calendar on my PC. I checked my calendar on the Incredible and it's all there. I have multiple email accounts and with the multiple home pages I can check email with ease. My old phone was was an HTC and I was very happy with it, very reliable. I downloaded the user guide....very helpful.. 

$$;
Pros:. I came up from the Eris, humongous improvement. Sense UI is as slick as ever, the Snapdragon processor makes it very hard to make the phone lag. Internal storage is nice, dropped a 2gb MicroSD for some apps.. 
Cons:. Not a single one of the batteries have gone through their adjustment stage. I'll post back with an edit whether or not the battery is better. It lasted an entire day on a charge, from about 8 am to 1am, and it had 9% when I plugged it in.. 
Summary:. It's by far the best phone you can get on Verizon. A friend of mine has a Moto Droid, he loves it but he certainly has some phone envy. HTC's widgets and other wonderful work just make Vanilla android seem well vanilla. The touchscreen is ultra responsive, visibility outside leaves something to be desired. But nothing you can't turn your back against to slightly improve sight.. Still on the fence? Go to the store and play with one, the display phone really set into stone that I was buying it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Hardware and software honestly blows the proprietary Apple iPhone away. Still above the iPhone 4.0 OS. No doubt. Use it and you'll see.. 
Cons:. The battery life isn't incredible, but what do you expect? The phone is really thin and, from my experience thus far, boasts a full 5 or 6 hours of HEAVY use with automatic brightness, haptic feedback, push, and sound on high.. 
Summary:. Truly an "iPhone Killer". This phone does it all. Android at its best, running the latest, seamlessly smooth Sense UI. I was a previous Motorola Droid owner and I loved it, but this phone simply blew it out of the water for me. The hardware and software shine when compared to others. It is truly incredible.. 

$$;
Pros:. The OS is great. Ease of use combined with the depth of data access make this a multi-purpose phone. The "unbelievable".. 
Cons:. Battery life is less than desirable. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim design, great camera, super easy texting, VOICE COMMAND TEXTING that is actually surprisingly accurate. snap dragon processor was appropriately named. noticeably faster than moto droid and less choppy. FAST web browsing. 
Cons:. I would like to see a flashlight app that uses the camera flash that WORKS on incredible, but thats not in anyway a negative of the phone. Im sure with time one will be available. everything else has exceeded my expectations.. 
Summary:. I dont think the issues noted by other users are as big a deal as the drama queens make them out to be. Ive had the phone for 6 hours now and have been thinkering WAY more than i probably should since its a new phone and its a sick phone i mite add. and after six hours of texting, youtube, web and app surfing.. not constant.. i do have a life and other things that snatch my attention. but a good chunk of the last 6 hours, and its still on factory charge that it came out of the box with.. ALSO.. ive noticed it showing 1 bar of service at times, but i picked it up and called my buddy,, clicked over to youtube.. sent texts.. with one bar and had no issues.. im not in a basement thats notorious for being a deadspot for some of the lesser cellphone providers and i have full use of my incredible.. i bought this phone because to me other than typical phone usage the most important functions to me are the camera and texting.. and both are.. incredible.. 8mp with a more than generous selection of editing options... and the texting.. ive been using the voice texting, where you push the microphone and say whatever you want to say.. wait half a second and there it is in plain text word for word what you just said.. and you can say "question mark" or "period" for punctuation... its invaluable for responding to texts while driving.. makes it much simpler, quicker, and safer.. and surprisingly 99.9% of what i said came out flawless in text.. and the other times it actually had ####### to hide my swearing.. and it changed "this" to "these" but i kinda mumbled... go to the verizon store.. play with the incredible they have on display.. as i did.. the moto droid is a sweet phone too but texting, and camera were two areas it was unimpressive.. its all up to personal prefferance. also check videos on youtube. ive seen head to head videos putting iphone 3G, and moto droid up agains htc incredible.. in two seperate videos, and in both.. incredible was faster than both.. but dont take my word for it. go to youtube, or google and check it out.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feels so good in hand, So fast, soooo fasttttt, ease of use, everything.. 
Cons:. The only problem is the battery life. 
Summary:. Love this phone, at first thought it felt flimsey but when I put the back on and held it in my hand , best feeling ever, love android os, love this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very thin, great screen, great color, clean simple and elegant design, FAST FAST FAST!!!!. 
Cons:. None yet really. Everything I thought I might not like turned out to be just fine.. 
Summary:. I can't say enough that this phone is great and truly the best smartphone in America. For those complaining of reception problems there are none that I have seen. The bars on the phone appear to be incorrectly reporting the signal. I've talked on the phone and used 3G and had no drops or problems even with one bar. I came from T-Mobile and had not only voice but data drops that simply haven't occurred with me going the exact same places with the Incredible. I'm sure there will probably be an update to correct the bars.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing UI, Great social networking functionality, Great screen, Great camera, Google Navigation, Great call quality, Excellent media capabilities, HTC sense, Android Marketplace, Phone is open as compared with Apple's locked down environment. 
Cons:. Takes a lot of fingerprints, No voice dialing. 
Summary:. Near perfect phone with amazing features and a superb browsing experience. This phone works perfectly as a business and a pleasure phone. I can't say enough about it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazingly fast Multitasking, Sleek, Small enough, Accurate GPS, blazing fast internet, Voice entries, Easy to setup - transfer from Blackberry to this, And excellent Apps. 
Cons:. If you have 1 Gig Hz processor in pocket, it's going to need few battery packs to go.. Let's face it, you are doing same as or faster as you would do it on your laptop, heck laptop won't give a 8 Meg camera or voice entries!!!. 
Summary:. Everything else suck... 

$$;
Pros:. Big ol touch screen, fast like a like a brand new computer, get lost in android market.. HTC SENSE + ANDROID + VERIZON 3G = one cool deal for me. 
Cons:. You will do so much with this phone besides just talk that the battery never stood a chance. Get a USB car charger and stop complaining.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is simple. Its been a long time coming but Verizon finally got the best phone out. Go Big Red.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Wicked fast. 2. HTC Sense interface is really slick. 3. Great Camera for a phone. 4. On board Memory. 5. Superior technical specs. 6. Tethering backed by verizon. 7. No pre-installed Verizon bloatware (a.k.a. crap). 
Cons:. Can't think of any.. 
Summary:. Buy this phone guys, it's really fast and responsive, best smartphone I've ever had my hands on. Serious competition to the Iphone and a worthy successor to the successful droid.. 

$$;
Pros:. FAST processor, lots of memory, nice big screen, android 2.1.. 
Cons:. Battery life is good for a smartphone, but isn't going to last mulitple days like a simple flip phone.. 
Summary:. I got the Droid Incredible after having a Blackberry tour and Motorola Droid. This is the best by far. If only for the processing speed alone, it's worth the money. No lag or slowdowns, even with multiple apps running. The camera is at least as good as the Motorola droid. The screen is awesome. Responsive and bright. I was at first very worried about typing without a keyboard (especially after coming from a blackberry), but this screen is so big that I'm not finding it to be a problem. Android is a GREAT OS. I loved it on the Motorola Droid and I love it on the Droid Incredible. Once you get used to it you really see how outdated the blackberry OS is.. Battery life is pretty good. In my test day I was streaming music from pandora, browsing the interent, and texting. I got a full day of use and that will probably increase once the battery cycles a few times. Yes, I would love a smartphone that could go five days without a charge, but really the Droid Incredible's battery life is on par with what your going to find in smartphone these days. Battery tech is still catching up to smartphone energy demands. That being said, is it really that hard to plug in a phone every night?. Overall, GREAT smartphone. If you want a touch screen only smartphone with Android, there arn't any better (for now).. 

$$;
Pros:. -Blazing fast. -beautiful. -camera is amazing. -love sense ui. -honestly, nearly everything except one.... 
Cons:. -only con: battery life so far. 
Summary:. Honestly this phone is amazing, I can't believe how far smartphones have come. I've had a iPhone 2G, and a BB Bold 9000 before this and I've never had a phone this fast and seamless between everything. Now I JUST got this phone in and have messing around with it all day. I've heard the battery needs a couple cycles to improve. But as of now the only downside I see is battery life. But I mean seriously? With this kind of speed and power what do you expect???. Updated. on May 28, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast; web browser is fast and great to use; easy to customize; android market; linking all contacts from email, facebook, phonebook; quick search from home screen; navigaton. 
Cons:. battery life - ive gotten about 12 hours out of my charges with moderate-heavy use. 
Summary:. This phone is incredible. Its super fast and easy to use. Web browsing is almost as good as on a computer. Linking all of your contacts from all of your accounts is easy and centralizes all messages and updates from them. Browsing through pictures on facebook is so fast its crazy. Its faster than browsing photo albums that were stored on my old phone's SD card... Almost everything about this phone seems just about perfect to me so far. The only downside so far is the battery life. I have a feeling that its going to be sitting on its charger a lot.... 

$$;
Pros:. this phone tops Iphone and Motorola Droid. it does everything and more. I love the way that I could text with voice and it works perfect.. 
Cons:. the camera takes a while to focus but not to bad. 
Summary:. throw away your Motorola Droid and your The Iphone this is the best.. Updated. on Apr 29, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. - Better Quality Touch Panel than GN1. - Fast Browser with Flash. - Connectivity with TV or Large Display (Can be Used as an Internet Browser on TV. - Crystal Clear &#38; Bright Display. - Better Video Experience. - Less Worry over 3G Wireless Connectivity. 
Cons:. - Video: Need to do a bit of homework to know how to upload a video from PC, DVD, and BD. (The video quality is better than competitors). - Cannot stop spending time playing on this device. 
Summary:. - Incredibly Great. - What Else Can I Say. - Better as It Is not on AT&#38;T. 

$$;
Pros:. -sturdy feel. -plenty of screen space. -8mp camera, 1ghz processor, 8gb internal memory, came with a 2gb micro sd card!!, great OLED screen - crystal clear picture - bright colors. - LIGHTweight, cant tell its in my pocket. -LOW learning curve. 
Cons:. - i dislike the charger. it sticks outta the wall, looks flimsy. they do make other types tho... - youtube hd videos took a while to load off 3g. havent tested off wifi. prob alot faster.. 
Summary:. this phone came 2 days early due to a glitch at VZW.. i LOVE this phone.. this phone is it!!! much better than the iphone. i have the ipodtouch mp3 player and have had since launch. this is just as sensitive as the iphone, same weight, bigger screen, SOOOOOOOO much faster than my neighbors.. i love it to death!. i have had 1 samsung, 2 lg, and 1 droid and returned ALL of them because the phone itself was just horrible.. trust me - just trust me... this is the phone to get.. 

$$;
Pros:. The best part of this phone is the speed. Nothing slows it down. The next best part is the google integration thanks to Android, plus the HTS sense sitting on top of it. Anything you have ever wanted a phone to do, this phone does exceptionally.. 
Cons:. I wish the battery lasted longer, but until we have a revolution in the battery industry this is reality for any device.. 
Summary:. Buy this phone if your on Verizon and have wanted a world class top quality smart phone, you won't be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. It runs Android and the latest firmware and it's open source compared to the crappy iPhone. HTC Sense. Runs on Verizon 3G so it's BLAZING FAST!. 8 megapixel camera. 8GB storage and much more. 
Cons:. You can't use voice and data at the same time.. This really isn't a con but I would have liked a slide out keyboard.. 
Summary:. I have the Droid from Verizon. It was a great phone but it was missing a few features such as a great camera and the storage was certainly lacking. I know you can add a microSD but you can't use it to store apps. That is where the Incredible comes in. It has storage upon storage for all your app needs. The UI is also HTC Sense with Android which makes for a very sleek experience. I tested the phone at a Verizon store and I have to say I'm really impressed with the UI.. Being a touch only phone, they made it really easy to navigate around. Grouping contacts, moving from screen to screen etc. I was able to get it on pre-order and will get it the day or day after it is available. Android is really going places!. 

$$;
Pros:. very easy to use. 
Cons:. none really once you figure out how to turn on/off wifi and 3g. 
Summary:. This is my first smartphone; I've never had a blackberry, iphone, droid, etc.; never had a PDA, itouch, etc. either. My wife and I had samsung flip-phones from Verizon for a few years; I couldn't justify the $30/month data charge per phone, so when Verizon changed their pricing structure, we decided to get smartphones.. I had been researching them over the past 6 months, and had narrowed it down to the Incredible, Droid X, and Droid 2. The Droid X was just too big; the Droid 2's slide out keyboard worried me; so we decided to go with the Incredible.. It's awesome. Like I said, I've never had a smartphone, so I have nothing to compare it to. But, we've had them for around 2 weeks, haven't had any problems. Voice is fine. Camera/video works well. We've been using the calendar app. Music is ok. Very easy to click and drag files between phone and laptop.. As far as those complaining about battery issues. I noticed the battery going down the first week or so. However, one thing that seems to help, is to turn off the wifi, 3g, gps, etc. when you're not using it. I don't use this phone for work, it's strictly personal, so I don't need to be "connected" all day every day. If I want to check email quickly, I just turn on wifi or 3g depending on where I am. And, I use the phone as my alarm clock now, so I just charge it every night anyway. I haven't had any battery issues since I started manually turning wifi and 3g on and off, vs keeping them on all day.. Anyway, I love this phone and recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. Power. Super fast web browsing. Thousands of free apps.. 
Cons:. The only con (and it's minor) is battery. 
Summary:. I researched this phone to death and finally bought it. I am so glad I did!! Amazing smartphone. I don't understand some reviews that say "worst phone" Are you kidding? They must have received a reject because this phone lives up to it's name for sure!!! Starting with turning it on, a simple push. You don't have to hold anything down. You can do everything from this phone. I love how easy it is to use it. Just a push of a button gets you on the web, facebook, gps, wherever you want and whatever you want. And it's super fast and super smooth! Customizing the 7 home screens is awesome and fun. The Droid Market is amazing with thousands of free apps. Link up your contacts to email, voice mail, facebook, twitter, whatever you want. Great backgrounds, and the list goes on!!!! I don't have any trouble seeing my screen in daylight or in the sun. Sensative to the light so your home keys come on only when the ambient lighting is down. I use the phone alot and the battery needs charging by late evening and I start it up around 7am. So the battery isn't that bad. I'm going to get an extended battery anyway. If you are considering this phone, don't hesitate!! The greatest phone out there. The cool thing, is that I am still getting surprised by all the things this Incredible phone can do. Don't listen to the naysayers out there. IT's truely INCREDIBLE!!. 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is beautiful, the phone is FAST!!, It gives you little bonuses like a 8mp camera, It's stylized in a cool way, Android is simplified with HTC Sense and it's my favorite version or android.. 
Cons:. Only one it's not a GSM world phone and if im on a business trip(or a vacation) in say europe then ill ave to buy another handset and i can't imagine using anything else. 
Summary:. Like i said when you have Android, a manufacturer like HTC, a 1 gigahertz processor, a amazing screen(even if it's not as good as the galzxy s), and little goodies like a 8mp camera dual LED flash and HTC Sense simplyfying a sometimes confusing android os, theres no reason to not love this phone,................... except one if i ever go abroad on a vacation or a business trip than i wont be able to use this phone and even if i shell out 500 dollars for a phone in the new country without a contract(i'll probably have to buy a different one for everywhere i theres different carriers) it will still be different and probably inferior to this phone and that in itself is A BIG PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Blazing Fast Internet, Bright Crisp Display, 8MP Camera, Design and Comfort in Hand, Lightweight ~ Just all round awesome device!. 
Cons:. The only con I have found in this phone is its visual display in bright sunlight.. 
Summary:. I am the female equivalent to a cell phone geek. I usually get bored with my phone after about 6 months and am ready for the next newest and greatest device. I am also an Apple junkie. I have a macbook, the ipad, and of course, the iPod Touch, but could NOT be sold on the iPhone. I bought the very first one, and gave it to my husband after 2 months of being frustrated with its simple missing functions and ATT's shoddy service. For me, you can throw ANY freakin feature you want to on a phone, but if it can't MAKE and HOLD a PHONE CALL, then its absolutely worthless.. To me, the Incredible gives you ALL the great features of the iPhone and then some, but INCLUDES solid phone service with Verizon. The speed of browsing still blows me away. All the free apps blow me away. Its functionality is near flawless. Ive been a Crackberry addict ever since I passed on the iPhone, and desperately wanted the new Torch, but REFUSED to return to ATT. I stopped at Verizon to see what they had instead. Ive never played with a Droid, but after 10 min with the Incredible, I was SOLD. This is just an all round amazing phone. The first 3-4 days, I did have issues with the battery life, and thought I may have to return it. But it seems that after 3 or 4 cycles, the battery seems to work just fine now. I've been using the phone all day, texting, browsing, etc (about 12 hours) and I still have about 60% battery life left, so I'm a happy camper. You wont regret getting this one! Its DEFINITELY a KEEPER!. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is the the slickest piece of technology I have ever held in my hand. It does everything I want, only faster. If your looking for a phone, go to your local Verizon dealer and try an incredible. You will come away an owner.. 
Cons:. I would have given 5 stars but, as all have mentioned, the battery life is impressively limited. I realize I could turn things off to help and conserve power, but come on, its like giving a kid candy then telling them not to eat it... it's just mean.. 
Summary:. Step 1: Go to your local Verizon dealer. Step 2: Try this phone. Step 3: Buy this phone. Just that easy. 

$$;
Pros:. 8MP Camera and 720p HD Video recording through Froyo, Adobe Flash 10.1, Brilliant Display, Excellent Multimedia capabilities, Fast navigation through apps and home screens, Free Google Navigation with Voice Search compatibility.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better, even for a PDA.. 
Summary:. I have had a variety of devices from the most basic to some of the most complex, including the Motorola Droid. The Droid Incredible really does live up to the hype that was built. To start, the phone is fast, which is the result of the 1GHZ Processor and this translates to other functions from apps to the camera. The camera's resolution is crisp and the detail contained within the pictures that I have taken is full (from about 75-100yds away, individual leaves of a tree still show with distinction). The video recording capabilities are also outstanding, but there are times in which the recording hangs briefly while playing, but this rare. The navigator function on the phone is amazing and coupled with voice search, by pressing the microphone icon, you can ask the phone to navigate to a certain location and not have to touch the phone again, which is very convenient for travel. Google Marketplace is also a great feature, which offers over 68k apps, many relevant apps being free such as Google Earth and various background/ringtone/game apps. I am also pretty current with multimedia technology, possessing a newer iPod Touch and the Incredible has made it rather obsolete, which is a drag because I have probably thrown down several hundred dollars in music and videos. My primary complaint is that the battery life is not the best around, even regarding PDA devices, which is one of the reasons behind the recent change of displays on the Incredible.. It lives up to the hype and offers great capabilities, with more versatility than most other devices out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast response from the Snapdragon proc. Great OS. Just updated to Froyo and have better battery life afterwards. It is open source.. 
Cons:. Still have a tough time thinking of any cons...guess the only thing to say is somewhat limited battery life and somewhat limited dedicated accessories.. 
Summary:. The Incredible has been just that for me. Though this is my first smartphone I have used other brands and still believe that hands down the Incredible beats them all. I may sound like a fan boy but who isn't when they like the product they use. Anyway, call quality is excellent, app selection is excellent (more apps then I know what to do with), camera takes quality photos and easily rivals most point and shoots. I have not had any problems with battery life since I uninstalled ATK...you just have to back out of the app to have Android close it down like it should. At any rate, this is certainly the best smartphone available in my opinion and I would definitely recommend this product and also would upgrade to the next Incredible if there is one.. 

$$;
Pros:. fast fast fast. perfect size screen very bright and clear. 
Cons:. battery. I use advanced task killer all the time, lowered the screen brightness, turned off off a lot of animations and it can barely get through the day. Just plan on charging it every night. 
Summary:. Love the phone. I can hardly set it down. Glad I went with the incredible and not the X. The incredible is plenty big.. 

$$;
Pros:. Faster than any iPhone or iPod I've ever used, Android&gt;&gt;&gt;iOS, the 1ghz snapdragon processor is extremely fast, dual LED flash, 8mp camera very sharp, design is nice. I love the back design. Optical joystick is great for pacman, beautiful screen. 
Cons:. Power-hog, battery only lasts 6-7 hours of heavy usage (But I heard that the battery gets better as you own the phone longer), screen is hard to see in bright sunlight (better when the brightness is on it's highest, uses more battery), plastic body. 
Summary:. The phone is better than any other phone I have ever owned. It is light-weight and has a great screen (not in bright sunlight), but feels a little cheap with the lightness and the plastic of the body. Optical joystick is unique and very useful for some games (especially arcade games), but no dedicated camera button on the side. Buttons under the screen are responsive with vibrating feedback when you press them. The camera is sharper than my parents' Sony camera and video is hgih quality (not 720p, but android 2.2 Froyo might come with 720p video recording and LED lights for recording video). The LED flash is surprisingly bright. Auto focus and tapping the screen on a target to focus on are almost digital-camera quality. Extremely short picture delay from the time you press the button to take the picture (You would have to swing the phone around on purpose to blur the picture). The volume rocker is a little too flush with the side. The phone speaker for speakerphone and music playing is louder than an iPod touch, and actually has some bass which is a first for me on a phone. The 3.5mm headphone jack is always good instead of having to buy a cheap proprietary pair of headphones or buying an adapter. The charging/data transfer port is micro-usb (which isn't as common for devices), so don't loose the cable. The wall-charger can charge anything that uses USB (not just this phone) so you can use it for your other devices as well (If you have their usb charging cable with you). It comes with 8gb of internal memory and a free 2gb micro sd card came with mine. This is a great phone and with HTC Sense UI I think this might make it better than the Droid X, but just barely. Great phone! 4.5 stars. 

$$;
Pros:. "Incredibly" fast, excellent apps store, excellent voice quality, network second to none.. 
Cons:. Difficult to see the screen in bright sunlight. No HD movie.. 
Summary:. I just switched from iphone and could not be happier. Blazing fast, tons of apps, and most importantly, it makes phone calls without dropping them. Doubles as an excellent GPS/ navigation system.. Finally the phone which can stand up and beat the iphone @ its game. Very happy with Verizon... 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, slim and has Android, by far better then any apple system. 
Cons:. Hard to see in the light. Simple solution turn brightness up and you will have no problems. Battery dies quickly, easy fix- keep your wifi, 3G and bluetooth off unless your using it. Buy a spare they are super cheap! Sensitive screen. 
Summary:. I waited months for this phone to come out and I have not yet been disapointed. The cons can easily be fixed if you don't mind changing a couple things now and then to fit your enviornment and use of the phone, it only takes seconds. Android is fantastic and has more free apps than apple. Plus, its on the best network in the NW! :-). 

$$;
Pros:. Speed, Sense UI, call quality, and size. I've had the phone for 3 weeks and it just "works".. 
Cons:. I would have preferred actual physical buttons for home, menu, back, and search. Battery life is not great, but I've tweaked it by being careful about what apps I install and being reasonable with their sync settings.. 
Summary:. The phone has performed flawlessly. I did go and take a look at the Droid X last week when it was released since I'm still in my 30 day window. After running it through its paces for 15 minutes I decided it was an impressive piece of hardware, but it was a little too large. The Incredible just feels more comfortable to hold and I don't really see the 720P video capture as something I would use all that often. I'm very pleased with the phone and can see myself using it for the next 18-24 months. Swiftkey "beta" is awesome! I tried Swype and while I can see how it could be very good after you get through the learning curve, I think Swiftkey is a great keyboard anyone can start using right away.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremly fast, this phone never skips a beat.. Display is very crisp and colors are vibrant.. Size is comfortable in hand and Pocket. Touch screen has a great feel and sensitivity. Great sound quality with head phones. 
Cons:. One way to turn on display. 
Summary:. I absolutely love this phone. It has actually exceeded my expectations. HTC and Big Red(Verizon) did a great job making sure this phone was the quality smartphone customers wanted. Yes battery life doesn't last 2 or 3 days like simple feature &#38; media phones can, but smartphones like the incredible are practically mini computers. Battery life will eventually catch up to our ridiculous demands from our technology, and by that time i'm sure we will have some other crazy expectations from our cell phone manufacturers.. I have really enjoyed using the Android OS. It's exciting to see another company step up to the plate against Apple. The Incredible is a "perfect storm" combining HTC's sleek design, Sense UI, and Android OS.. Great phone, wouldn't trade it in for any other on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera. Android. 
Cons:. Expensive. Heavy. 
Summary:. I want to make sure everyone knows that this phone is only $150 at Amazon:. &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003HC8NUW?ie=UTF8&#38;tag=wedwicom-20&#38;linkCode=as2&#38;camp=1789&#38;creative=390957&#38;creativeASIN=B003HC8NUW"&gt;Amazon HTC DROID INCREDIBLE Android Phone (Verizon Wireless)&lt;/a&gt;. Cheers. 

$$;
Pros:. Its power, speed, network, presentation, feel, intuativness. 
Cons:. The battery. 
Summary:. Nothing beats a phone that works amazingly with multimedia, social networking, and work. A real work and play phone that WILL satisfy most, if not all, of your needs.. 

$$;
Pros:. I LOVE THIS PHONE! It is quick, responsive, and I can operate it with one hand. The screen is bright and clear, even in the sun. Beautiful still shots, clear, crisp video.. 
Cons:. What else..battery life. Also, the photo capture button is a bit hard to manuever when framing the shot...a voice actuated ap would be great here.... 
Summary:. Buy it...forget the sluggish Droid X...this Incredible is the one to beat...Better research your prices...Amazon is selling the phone COVER for $3.90, not the entire phone. I WISH I could have purchased mine for that price.. 

$$;
Pros:. i have heard a lot of good stuf but should i get the old droid, the new droid, the iphone, or the devour???. 
Cons:. I don't know if I should buy the new droid or not. But I really want that one the most.. 
Summary:. IDK. 

$$;
Pros:. Paired with Google Voice, this is an incredible phone (heh)! With a couple of tricks, I get at minimum 45 hours of battery life (I get @55-60 hours if I don't use it much).. 
Cons:. Battery life was not great, especially if you opt-in to installing all of the Verizon and HTC apps during the initial setup.. 
Summary:. Here's how I fixed my Incredible's battery life: http://shadrach.posterous.com/htc-incredible-battery-fix. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed. It is pretty fast. Very responsive, and I've found tons of FREE apps that I like. Camera takes good photos, for what I've taken so far.. 
Cons:. Guess what? Battery life. I understand because this isn't the average flipphone that I've had over the years. I run ATK as much as possible, and I keep it charging whenever it's not in use. Them's the breaks.. 
Summary:. As stated above, this is my first smartphone I've ever had. I'm not a TECHIE, so I don't have a lot of technical responses to give for this phone. I guess, ignorance is bliss. If I knew more about this stuff, I'd have plenty of bad things to say, as I've seen in more technical reviews. I have found plenty of free games to play, free ringtones to get, and I've synced my mp3's to it, replacing my mp3 player. I haven't had any signal issues with phone calls. The phone sounds clear, and sounds clear on the other end, according to my callers. I like the speaker phone. My mom said I sounded clear as a bell when the phone was set to speaker, an issue I've had with flipphones in the past. I'm sure as soon as I'm done playing with the thing 24/7, the battery life will come around. My logic is this on that regard: Older phones had better battery life because all you did with them was make phone calls and text. Now you have a phone that you can have in your hands all the time, finding things to do. As soon as everyone's done fiddling with it, battery life will seem better.. As far as the construction of the phone goes, I'm slightly concerned with the sturdiness of it. I'm not a pencil-pusher, doctor, lawyer, executive, etc. I'm a maintenance worker who works with his hands, so I'm trying my best not to have my phone on me while working, because I think one false move could be the phone's demise. I will be investing in a case for it.. The free yellow pages app is pretty sweet. That eliminates the use of 411 for finding a number, which costed me extra minutes/charges whenever I used to use it. There's a ton of free apps that are great to have. My suggestion is to go at this phone with an open mind, not be TOO critical of all the little things, and you'll have fun with it.. My last 3 phones I've upgraded earlier than the 2 years, because I was bored with them. I'm figuring that I'll have this phone for the complete 2 year interval this time. Hope I helped, take care everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Pros of this phone are too numerous to mention. Most have already been expressed in other reviews. It's fast, it's small, it has upgrades that you needed apps for previously on Droid.. and on and on.. 
Cons:. Get a startup editor to cut out programs you don't want there and get an extended life battery. I got seidio. I had to do that with all my phones. The poor reception is ridiculous, just search it for incredible. HTC says they are working on it.. 
Summary:. Overall I love the functions phone's os, the apps like locale, etc. But none of that means anything if I am sitting at my desk or at home and all my calls are going straight to VM. This issue is well documented on the HTC and other forums. HTC says. We are currently aware of this issue and working to address this is in the next MR (ROM update). Like all ROM updates, we cannot provide the exact date for an expected release, as there may be delays that are out of HTC?s control.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superphone not smartphone! Keyboard is the best touchscreen out there. No need for a real keyboard here. Very fast at everything. Completly satisfied.. 
Cons:. Slight learning curve. Alarm clock is weak. I can't believe the complaints others have posted. learn to use your device for optimal battery life i.e...android task killer.. 
Summary:. I've had mine for about 2 weeks now and it stands up to its name. The battery is fine. For those of you that complain about it...GET A LIFE! I use mine quite a bit and even on days of heavy use it lasts at least one full day...what more could you want? It performs amazing...NO REGRETS! Everything about this phone is way above average...battery, camera, keyboard, touchscreen, processor, all good to go.. Updated. on Jun 5, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. What amazing functionality!. 
Cons:. Battery...although it isn't as bad as I though it was going to be.. 
Summary:. I tried the Moto Droid and brought it back to the store. Then tried this one and love it!! So much better!. 

$$;
Pros:. Unless the Android 2.1 operating system on this phone is different from the Android 2.1 my Eris just upgraded to, then all this chatter of no voice and data at the same time is baloney. I do it all the time, looking at web pages or maps and talking.. 
Cons:. It's not a Dell Mini 5 (Streak). That is the phattest phone on the market this year, hands down. Same OS. This Incredible is incredible (imagine overstated french accent like on the Incredibles movie).. 
Summary:. Easy breezy beautiful. 

$$;
Pros:. Great design. Extremely fast. Great camera and video camera. Responsive. Great call quality. 
Cons:. Battery life. Convenience keys for camera. 
Summary:. The Good:. Design is nice with red accents reminds me of "I'm professional and wild" attitude. Black dress with a red scarf - yes, it's a plus. There's an idea for webisode.. Fantastic AMOLED (Active Matrix Organic LED) Screen - very bright and vivid.. Phone quality and reception is great. A couple of people who didn't know that I got a new phone asked if I did because of sound quality. Speaker phone is not as loud but great. Anne's mom hates it when I put her on the speaker phone because she cannot hear me well. I called her, put her on the speaker phone and carried on a conversation without her complaining once about the fact she was on the speaker phone.. Love the VIP widget where you can do one touch call to a anyone in the VIP list. I only call less than 10 people on a regular basis so it works well not having to go through all my business contacts to find these contacts.. I've heard a lot of gripe about exchange email integration and Android. Frankly, I was a bit worried. To my surprise, it was a breeze, it functions extremely well. Watch out BlackBerry, this frankly was a better email client with again a VIP list, one touch email filtering by conversation, flagged etc.... Browser is fast and to my surprise just as good as the webkit iPhone browser. Flash plug-in works ok and I felt it was a great addition to the mobile browsers.. Camera is very good and takes great pictures. Center metering mode works best. The video camera is also stunning for a phone camera, there is no HD option, but I don't think I'd need it, obviously these wont replace still cameras and HD video cameras.. The best thing about the phone is the UI and performance. The mix of the Android UI with Sense UI by HTC makes this phone one of the best in the market. I think Sense picks up where Android lacks. I'd say this by far is the best contender to the iPhone UI. (Shhhhh.... I think it maybe better, but I can't call it because I don't use an iPhone on a day to day basis).. It is extremely fast and responsive, I've ran multiple apps, 3D games without even a hiccup. With all these open I tried Google Wave on it, which is not really made to run on a mobile phone, yes, then, it choked.. The other surprising thing is this phone makes most of the tasks like composing a message, looking up information and navigation a breeze - you don't have to type it just say it. Voice to text works extremely well even with my Sri Lankan accent!. The Bluetooth audio seems to sound stronger and better, I listen to Pandora on the way to work and I used to have to turn up the volume on my car stereo to hear it decent. With the Incredible I don't have to turn the radio up so much.. The Bad:. I miss convenience keys on the side for voice prompt and the camera. The track pad works well but is useless because the touch screen does most of what the track pad does.. The battery life is poor, but I expected that and I'm used to it. When you have bluetooth and WiFi off it is a bit better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful color, Uber customizable, tons of sweet apps. I love the voice to text app.. 
Cons:. Battery life is a concern, but that is to be expected with the color and functionality of the phone.. Takes a while to figure the phone out. Not recommended for people who are not familiar with smart phones.. 
Summary:. I was a little concerned after reading the reviews about signal strength, and battery life. After using this phone for three weeks now, I have had absolutely no problems with signal strength. Internet and Google maps traffic are both fast enough that I am never annoyed waiting for data to load.. I noticed that the first week I had the phone that I was frequently running out of battery after about 10 hours. After a week, the battery started lasting a few hours more. Probably because I wasn't constantly playing with it. HTC includes a really cool widget for power control that allows you to turn off battery draining components that you are not using, such as bluetooth, WI-Fi, GPS, sync, and also adjust the light level.. Bottom line is that all the complaints that I have read on the user reviews can be remedied with an app.. I got sick of waiting for the iPhone to come out on Verizon, and I'm glad I did. I love this phone!!. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone allows me to personalize it to my taste, gives me Verizon's network, is instantaneously responsive and has a decent web browser.. 
Cons:. Battery life, but given the large screen and the snapdragon processor, I am not surprised. When used as a phone rather than as a computer, the battery last several days.. 
Summary:. I had a Blackberry Tour prior to purchasing this phone, and I have owned several smart phones going back to the "Q". I enjoyed the Blackberry Tour much like some folks enjoy their I-phones- they are simple to use with little learning curve. However, if you wish to do more, then the android OS is more satisfying, and the HTC Sense interface makes the Android phone accessible. As a productivity tool, this phone excels: I can read websites without getting a headache, I can use the speaker phone and actually hear and be heard, and I can play games during long time-wasting meetings instead of faking a seizure.. My big stubby fingers can use the touch screen typing pad without much retyping, and it fits in my pocket. Much has been made of the battery life, but with a free application, called Advanced Task Killer, I can extend my battery life fairly easily. (Thanks to the Verizon clerk who told me about it). What blows me away is how fast this phone is when running various tasks. The GPS works well, and I like that it is a free application. As a simple phone, it works really well. I'm middle-aged, and my hearing isn't what it once was, but I have no problems with this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks, speed, functionality, size, apps, does it all. 
Cons:. Battery could be better but extended batteries and software updates will help. 
Summary:. This phone will do it all. The negative reviews seem to have a common theme, comparisons to iphone or blackberry. Well this is not an iphone or blackberry so get over it. Those of us who choose this phone for its flexibility, customization, features, and potential are enjoying it! The web is actually usable and the ability of the android platform is great, plus with the memory and performance of the phone I can leave the laptop in the office for most meetings! Purchase of the slim line seidio 1750 mAH battery (does not change thickness of phone) has helped but I was getting a solid 13 to 14 hours a day with normal use and stock battery with exchange and gmail sync using task killer regularly. This phone is an advanced device that performs as advertised and more. The reception is great and call quality is exceptional (bars of service mean nothing, signal meter is what you should check) and since the phone is on the VZ 3G network you can actually get the use of your phone when you need it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great responsive capacitive touch screen. I like the speed at which it handles even my most tech-forward operations. Awesome to have 1-ghz processor in a phone, which is slight overkill, but I'd rather that than sluggish, poor performance.. 
Cons:. Streaming video is far behind Apple's on the exact same sites. I tried CNET on both, and iphone kills. Optic mouse is decent, maybe I move too fast, as it works if I chill out on trying to make it work faster. Battery and reception= marginal. 
Summary:. Overall, the Incredible is great for my purposes, as I have upgraded to an iPad, sold the iPhone for the cost of the Incredible, and have subsequently realized how much better web videos are on a larger screen. For my preferences, I'm probably not going to miss much for streaming video, but a patch or update for the reception and a bigger batter would make this the best phone out! Was going to wait for iPhone 4G/HD, but opted to break from the confines of Apple and I'm lovin' it. When I play NES/SNES roms on my phone, I realize now what people have been saying about the Android platform and its open-source benefits. Don't pay more that $199 for this phone, and even then, try to get an SD card thrown in, as that is what happened for the launch. Verizon has wiggle room and their reps work on commission. Use that knowledge to your advantage when purchasing plans and phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast.. Sleek Design.. Hasn't ever crashed on me and I run plenty of apps.. 
Cons:. Just two things: I wish i was also given a SD card as well for quickly transfering docs from computet and phone.. &#38; Some apps require and SD card to work. This phone has the SD slot and 8 gigs of internal memory.. 
Summary:. Great Phone. Must invest in a new Micro SD card.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful design. Plenty of Apps, Customizable, Light weight. 
Cons:. Feels like plastic, No physical send/End keys, Its a pain to close down programs. 
Summary:. I think this is an amazing phone. The only reason that I will not give this phone 5 stars is because I don;t like the fact that you need to "kill" applications in a roundabout way through a task killer or going into settings . I personally think it is a major pain in the butt. A task killer is recommended though the phone does come with an application manager though I find it tedious and confusing to use. Also until any battery is put into a phone that can last at least 48 whole hours of heavy use of music play, constant apps running etc without being charged will I give any phone 5 stars. Battery life isn't too terrible however if we are going to keep making more and more advanced devices that can do just about anything, I think that there should be a battery revolution to accommodate them to bring on full potential.. I do miss physical send and end keys.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android O/S, standard memory for phone and apps, quality, size, weight, power, features (HTC Sense adds even more), ease of use, Verizon window mount and holster accessories, battery life given the power, antenna reception, speakers, configurabilty.. 
Cons:. The name--certainly it will not be so incredible in a year--technology advance being what they are these days. The screen is hard to read in bright sunlight, but aren't they all??. 
Summary:. Currently, the Incredible is the best of the best (I'm partial to the Android phones). It is not perfect, but it is darn good. After my Moto Droid locked up for the 4 or 5th time (BTW, it was not due to buggy apps), I traded it in for the Droid Incredible on the 29th (so glad I was still within the 30 trial period!). The Incredible is light weight, yet has a solid, well made feel. It is much faster and smarter than the Moto Droid all around and especially so for downloading emails with lots of graphics. My Moto Droid would literally go for minutes trying to download a graphics intensive email. The Incredible down loads a portion of the email, then with just a click I can get the remainder in a few seconds or delete it straight away. There is no waiting for long a download before deleting or having to delete before seeing the entire email--just to avoid the long wait. Plus, the email icon has a dynamic display of the current number of new/unread emails. More comparisons of the two: It has 7 screen panels vice 3, 512 RAM vice 256, 8 Gbyte onboard Flash memory vice 0. However, you only get a 2 Gbyte micro SD card (or $30 toward a larger card) vice a 16 Gbyte micro SD card for the Moto DroidSense adds a ton of features and extra integration; however, they do come at a price. As one should expect with software, more power means more to learn. However, the extra power, integration and capabilities are well worth it. Also, I love the fact that Android is an open source O/S. Being based upon Linux, that was a given. The iPOD being from Apple is quite the opposite--hope you iPOD users like what Apple wants you to have ... because that is what you will get. The flexibility, power, upgradability--and thanks to the integration provided by Google--and the many apps already available, these devices are far more than smart phones--really, they are personal life devices (PLDs). My Incredible has replaced my need for a separate vehicle GPS, hand-held hiking type GPS, camera, camcorder, portable alarm clock, marine weather radio, micro TV, MP3 Player, PDA, satelite radio (via Pandora internet radio) etc. AND done so in an improved fashion AND provided so much more at the same time. For instance, the Google Navigation app has provided me with recreational boater's maps that tell me where I am on the map--this is big for lakes lacking mile markers. Of course, where ever I am, I can do an internet search, get weather updates, do a quick search for a phrase or word in Bible, check my calendar, check news headlines (USA Today, etc. etc.), view and share photos, etc., etc., etc., Personal Life Device ... yes ... it integrates everything I do and makes keeping up fast and easy. I get instant access to email and new email notifications, text and photo messaging,etc. With no access to personal email at work, once home, I used to find time only a couple of times a week to check personal email; Facebook status notes, messages, etc. Just this is a big help and headache saver. Also, the accessories are much better for the Incredible. I like the Incredible's window mount much better as it brings the phone closer and releases from the window with the press of a button. The Verizon branded holster is nice looking, perfectly engineered and has a non slip surface. The back cover is a slide and snap rather than a snap-on with clips. Hence you can remove and install often (such as to use the window mount) with no worry of breaking clips. The back cover slides into the other half of the holster (the half with the wide, smooth, low profile belt clip) with the screen facing your hip to protect the screen. Plus, this half has a baby soft liner to protect the screen from scratches. There are several Moto Droid holsters and none are as smartly done as Verizon's Incredible holster.. I held off for a month or two from getting a smart phone after I was eligible for a phone upgrade due to the $30/month unlimited data charge; however, one day of use made that an easy pill to swallow. I'll gladly cut my expenses elsewhere if I need to. If you are on the fence--go for it! Smart phones (more like "personal life devices") bring so much integration, efficiency, power and new capabilities that you will not count the cost. Certainly, competition will bring that price down soon enough anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super-fast, intelligent, and gourgous! Don't get me started about the camera- you'd spend 200 dollars for a camera this good, but all you be able to do is take pictures and video!. 
Cons:. Battery that they put in it is less than great(so i'm buying the extended battery), but if you manage what operating on the phone, you have decent power. I'm not in love with the text messege system, but droid market will help here. screw iphone!. 
Summary:. I've had my Droid Incredible for a week, and when I first got it, I was overwhelmed. Kind of like a motorcycle rider, who starts up a 1100cc bike "too much bike for me!", but now that I have gotten used to it, I'm just Amazed! Who needs an iphone!! Frickin 8 meg camera, voice to text, live wallpaper, pinch zoom, great sound, 7 desktops, I'm so impressed! Bonus-I used to have LG Dare, my Dare power cord/USB worx on my Incredible!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Sexy. Doesn't bulge out of your pocket. 2. 1 GHz processor (more responsive than Apple_. 3. HD screen makes the iPhone look antiquated. 4. Browser speed beats most phones. 5. Android app store. Hands down.. 6. Flash video. 7. Verizon. 8. No reset yet!. 
Cons:. 1. Battery life. HOWEVER, disabling Contacts syncing and "always-on" data give you 2x increases. * * ALSO, there are aftermarket batteries. Reception can be hit or miss. 3G throughput speeds might be lower, but browsing is FASTER than iPhone (tested). 
Summary:. It is a sexy, solid reliable phone that has a swiss-army like set of features. It will attract everyone's attention.This is truly the first serious contender I've seen to the iPhone, and it blows all of the other Verizon phones out of the water entirely. The pros of this phone outweigh the cons by a long shot, and most of the cons can be easily fixed through some research.. If you paid $200 when the Storm came out or $300+ for the iPhone, the $200 tag on the Incredible gives you much more bang for the buck.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. super fast processor and browser. 2. 8 mp camera. 3. fm radio. 4. awesome apps available thru the android market. 5. good call reception. 6. easy to txt using touch screen. 
Cons:. 1. battery life is maybe a B-. i have to charge it every night, but i do that anyway.. 2. screen is hard to see in direct sunlight.. 
Summary:. I love this phone!. I upgraded to the incredible from my blackberry tour, which was maddening. It couldn't handle any kind of heavy app usage, the trackball was really finnicky, and the browser was lackluster.. In the week that I've had the incredible, i haven't had a single problem. It took me a full day to get used to the touch screen, but it is very intuitive, and i find myself wanting to pinch my computer screen to zoom in- ha!. The browser is fast and the pages are easy to view. The optical mouse is easy to use, but I find that I don't often need it. i still have a lot to learn about setting up my screens, but I've loved all the functions that I've seen.. The battery life also isn't as bad as some people are reporting. I recharge every night, and that's been fine.. If you're eligible for your upgrade from VZW, go for this phone. I would never get an iphone because of the reports of dropped calls and general reliability concerns, so i feel like this is the best substitution for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. SPEED, MUTI TASKING, ITS THE FASTEST PHONE EVA, PINCH TO ZOOM YOU NAME IT IT BEATS THE IPHONE!. 
Cons:. LOVE THE PHOEN THERES NOT ONE THING I DO NOT LIKE. 
Summary:. HTC YOU HAVE DONE IT! BT YOUR VERY ONE SIDED WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THE FIGHT. EVERYTHING THE IPHONE HAS, THIS PHONE DOES IT BETTER! BETTER NETWORK, BETTER 3 G, FASTER, MULTITASKING AND THE PICTURES OHH THE PICTURES 8MEGA PIXEL CAMERA, BT YOU FORGOT THAT TOO. DROID JUST DOES IT BETTER. 

$$;
Pros:. Plenty of apps and the processor to handle it. Been using it pretty much non-stop since Friday and I am still finding great little features. You won't be disappointed with what this phone can do for you.... AND it tethers... a must for me.. 
Cons:. BATTERY LIFE... This is the ONLY reason I would not give this phone a 10. I use this for business and usually on the phone or checking Emails. I have only been able to get through about 3/4 of a day on one charge.. 
Summary:. I really like this phone. It has worked flawlessly and has countless options. The app store for android is growing and it is great for work or pleasure. Especially with the Sence UI. You can set different scenes to fit your needs. Like I stated in the Cons... the only negative I have found is the battery life. You will need to look into an extended battery or keep a charger handy. There is rumor and update is coming to improve this issue, but nothing yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blazing fast Snapdragron processor, Call quality is outstandingLove the multi-function Android 2.1 OS. 
Cons:. Poor batter life, but can't compalint about it due to the features this phone provides.. 
Summary:. For anybody looking for a smartphone, I extremely recommend the HTC-Incredible in the nations largest 3G Verizon network. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding, Everything works and looks perfectly. FAST! plenty of storage. Perfect size, weight and power. Beautiful sharp bright screen, Very impressive.. 
Cons:. Battery Life Sucks.. 
Summary:. It is incredibly fast! very impressive phone, everything works the way you would expect it to and it has a very nice feel to it. If this phone had a better battery life i would say that there was no competitor but Battery Life just plain sucks. I admit that i use my phone quite a bit but this is just wrong. It will not last a whole day in a charge. even turning everything off and dimming the screen (or using the auto feature). The exact same things that i was doing using my HTC Vogue (With a Android ROM), but the vogue lasted longer!.
