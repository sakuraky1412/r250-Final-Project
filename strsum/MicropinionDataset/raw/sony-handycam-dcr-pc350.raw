Pros:. I have researched very carefully many cameras, including CANON, PANASONIC, JVC supposed competitors. Ignore anything in contrary. This is the best of them all. The best Image Quality (video and photos), the best features (video and photos) even at zero lu. 
Cons:. It's fair price would be around US$1000.00 without taxes. But I accepted to pay US$1200. You will need to buy an extra battery (US$60) and at least 128MBy memory card (US$100).. 

$$;
Pros:. This very small Sony Camcorder provides the user 3,050,000 pixel still pictures and 2,050,000 pixel (HD) video, even in the progressive scan mode. The PC350 has good color at 5 lux. and very good color at 10 lux or more. The SONY PC350 is a tremendous ca. 
Cons:. I have used my SONY PC350 Camcorder for several weeks with no problems. Very easy to use. Buy the ultra wide angle lens, the extra large battery and a remote control tripod. The sound the camera picks up is life like, it's outstanding. Considering it's. 

$$;
Pros:. Very high resolution video; very good resolution for digital stills from a camcorder (3.1 MP); very small size; Sony quality and features. 
Cons:. The only negative that I have found so far is that it is very expensive ($1000+), but for that price you get a very small combo camcorder digicam with 3.1 MP digicam. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent quality; fits in my pocket; has a flash (one dopey reviewer said it didn't!); and it's so easy to use a monkey could use it--I'm missing my left arm and I can easily access the menus.. 
Cons:. I defy anyone to explain any.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, high quality video, iLink works easily. 
Cons:. Only access via touchscreen. 
Summary:. This is a nice camera, delivering good quality video images &#38; decent photos. Light &#38; small, using easily obtainable, high quality MiniDV - I love it!. Minor irritations include touchscreen based menu only &#38; digital photos can only be trensferred via USB, requiring iLink AND USB if you use iLink.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size but packed with great picture quality and features. Review above incorrectly states that it does not have a flash for still photos but it does.. 
Cons:. Little expensive. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Touch screen, even in sun light 3Mpx still images with Flash Small size Large CCD sensor makes it better than small 3CCD panasonic camcorders 16:9 mode. 
Cons:. Short battery life Price could be a little lower, I paid $999 at Fry's electronics in Palo Alto, CA. 

$$;
Pros:. Very amazing camera, nothing more to say, just excellent. Try it for yourself!!!. 
Cons:. People who say bad comments for sure never used it!!! Give it a try first then comment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video quality. Good stills. Makes nice 4x6 prints at Costco. This is a perfect camera to take to themeparks and events with the kids. I'm so tired of having to lug still &#38; video cameras to every event. This camera is a great solution without mak. 
Cons:. Top mounted mic makes the videographer louder then the subjects. Boom mic is available but adds to the bulk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very compact. Takes amazingly sharp pictures even in widescreen mode. Great audio too considering how small this thing is. Many features. Decent still camera as well.. 
Cons:. A bit pricey, but worth it. I am not too sure about the whole " docking station " set up. It does work , but I think I might prefer just a fire-wire jack.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact design, easy to use, feature rich and amazing capabilities. Immediate start up without lag time.. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. Separate Dock, Picture package software, It takes 2-3 hours to burn one VCD. The miniDV recording cannot be transferred to harddisk but can only be written to VCD.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this camera to replace my old DCR-PC9. And WOW - what a difference. The video quality is simply amazing. It's performance under low light conditions is unbeatable. And it's very intuitive and easy to operate. You can't go wrong with this camera.. 
Cons:. I'd love an audio out jack, but it's not there.. 

$$;
Pros:. I just bought this for, beside replacing my broken digicam, shooting our family vacation. In general, this camcorder satisfies me. What I likes : - Excellent movie quality, I watch the recordings on my Sony HR29 TV, and the result was breathtaking, espec. 
Cons:. What I don't like : - Cannot record high quality still when on movie mode - Expensive memory card - Too complicated memory structure - Better to have physical buttons that through the LCD - Image stabilizer when taking still pictures can be better. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light-weight, easy to hold on to and carry. Super nice video results even indoors with inadequate lighting. I like the docking station! The camera is so small that a docking station is an included necessity. I like the 1394 interface. I like the to. 
Cons:. To make a great camera even better, you will need to add some accessories. I recommend two NP-FF71 batteries, the BC-TRF Compact Wall Charger, a Carrying Case, perhaps a Wide-Angle Lens, an external microphone with wind sock (ECM-MSD1), and the VF-R37NK N. 

$$;
Pros:. Light weight, excellent battery life, good range of 'smart' accessories. 
Cons:. Touch screen needs a stylus and the menu system is tedious.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great images, still and video in a very neat in a pocket sized (fairly large)multifuncion camera. All the features a fairly serious amateur would want. The touch screen is very effective in providing all the many, many controls in a convenient and compact. 
Cons:. The packaged software is klugey. The driver does not allow Windows explorer to manipulate images or video files in and out of the camera. All you can do is download and then process them. Strongly recommend second party software for editing videos. I expe. 

$$;
Pros:. Flat out this camera is the best new product this year. The picture is absolutely incredible. 16:9 mode played back on my panasonic plasma is almost perfect. The camera is small and with the extended life battery (which is smaller than I anticipated) g. 
Cons:. The only issue I have found concerns the auto-focus. As the editors state in the review, the camera does tend to wander in focus in less than favorable lighting. That being said, I have tried several other matchbook cameras from panasonic and canon and. 

$$;
Pros:. Sony camcorder ... implies Sony memory ... Price too high Features same Panasonic or Canon Touchscreen prevent you to have a clean screen I have choosen a Canon device instead. 

$$;
Pros:. Very small size. Compact. Still image is pretty good. Not bad quality for a 1 CCD and it being so small. I liked the auto focus ring too.. 
Cons:. Memory Stick Duo. Price is a bit much but might be worth it if you like compact and quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best combination out there for great video and still image quality, high-end features, and portability. LANC interface built into camcorder is pretty cool too. Lots of cool reusable (with other Sony products) accessories.. 
Cons:. Most features can be found on other (less expensive) camcorders, and this isn't small enough to go into your pocket (if you're used to the cellphone/ Blackberry/ Canon Digital Elph sizes). USB and firewire only available on dock -- disadvantage is if you. 

$$;
Pros:. The still picture capability is a big plus. Does any one who has used the HC 40 notice any significant improvement in the video recorded.. 
Cons:. Expensive.. 

$$;
Pros:. I make videos for a living and was looking for a small video camera to carry around with me. Although I wasn't crazy about the PC350 when I originally bought it, over the last few months I have really grown to like it. I don't use the photo mode, it still. 
Cons:. Resolution of viewfinder is too low, makes focusing hard.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good video, and the best stills I've seen from a camcorder. 3MP seems like the magic number for still pic detail, and what stands out is the low noise in the pics. The cnet review says the menu is very complex, but I find it's typical and not bad a. 
Cons:. Moderate ergonomics (typical for matchboxes). Memory stick Duo - come on, it's the same size as an SD card!. 

$$;
Pros:. Stills are excellent; focus always spot-on, even when very close. Video is great; Sony has image stabilization perfected! Low light pictures and video both good. Touch screen very easy to master.. 
Cons:. Awkward feel is overcome with use; camera is somewhat expensive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features. I have a 350E so I get 25p and 16:9 wide in cinematic effect mode. The photo quality is good enough for party and holiday shots. I'll still use my SLR for photos where I want the best quality. I use this camera to skydive with so It's size. 
Cons:. The docking station!!!! What were Sony thinking!!! I could care less about all the other connectors on the camera but firewire is the one I need and it's only on the dock! I have ordered a stylus to use with the touch screen, one really should have shippe. 

$$;
Pros:. Past satisfied user of Sony cams. Ready to upgrade. Everything about this cam sounds generally good, but.... 
Cons:. I've been looking at specsheets for this camera, and there's no specific mention of a headphone or audio out jack. Is this true?. 

$$;
Pros:. Nightshot is a plus, though super nightshot is choppy. The high memory capacity of Memory Stick Duo Pro. Small. Great video quality. Great audio quality. Manual focus is nice. The touch screen is nice. Quick display button for battery info while off. Feel. 
Cons:. Picture quality is blurred when zoomed in. Docking station stinks. Only the docking station has firewire so there's no way to use the firewire and a tri-pod. Memory Stick Duo, unnecessary. Doesn't support the high transfer speed of Memory Stick Duo Pro. C. 

$$;
Pros:. Some of you must not have really read reviews on this cam. It DOES have a flash, its mounted on the right side next to the lens. And I don't think the 30mm lens is much worse then 37mm, especially for the average user. I currently have the PC105 and pl. 
Cons:. Price being too high is very relavtive. You get what you pay for (most of the time).. 

$$;
Pros:. Very stylish, small and comfortable.. 
Cons:. Camera this expensive can only take pictures at 640X430 on the memory stick while recording video on tape. That's the whole purpose for me buying the camera. Very dissapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact. 
Cons:. The price is too high. I'm using Canon IS 1S for a few months now and it was a much better deal - $450 for the camera + $220 for 4gb microdrive. I hated the DV tapes. There was no way to transfer the video at higher speed than 1x. The Canon's resolution i. 

$$;
Pros:. Great resolution, very nice low light performance, built solid, feel is pretty good, compact size.. 
Cons:. Some web sites has individuals complaining of a buzzing sound that's very noticable during playback (recording in quite situations). Well, mine makes the sound so I wonder what's going on with some of these units that Sony is manufacturing. And based on a. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact. 
Cons:. This camera is inferior to the PC330E it replaces. The PC350 has a 30mm lens instead of 37mm, does not have the hologram exposure, will not record MPEG1 and does not have a built in flash. In addition the docking station is arkward when travelling and is. 

$$;
Pros:. small...... 
Cons:. lens diameter 30mm only...this will difficult to take picture at low light.
