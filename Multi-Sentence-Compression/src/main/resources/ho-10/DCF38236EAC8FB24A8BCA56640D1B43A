our room was clean and appears to have been recently decorated but very basic , the bed was huge and the linen was fantastic .

the staff were friendly and helpful ( very kindly allowed us in 2 hours early to change for a wedding ) but the reception was unmanned on arrival with a notice saying ask at the attached cafe if unattended - the queue at the cafe was ten people deep with one person serving !

this a basic hotel , not up to your premier inn or great western standard but it was clean and comfortable .
