dont belive everything you read alot of people that sponsor and work for other companies will say bad things about the best and they dont even own a forerunner  .
i live near a rain forest about a half a mile away and its always cloudy and theres alot of trees and i live in a island  .
so dont belive all these negative reviews there not true because theres one person that iam not going to mention but that person always write something negative about everything  .
so try the 305 forerunner and enjoy  .
its the best  .
for novice and for pros  .
try it you wont lose anything dont you have a return policy at you local store  .
so give it a try  .
and you be the judge .
i have had the 305 for approx  .
6 months , and have logged four runs a week every week  .
when i purchased it i immediately upgraded chipset to 2 , 9 version  .
i turned it on and acquired satellites in about 15 seconds in south florida  .
i use sportstrack software and it showes path on satellite photos  .
amazing data to help track progress  .
programable screens  .
virtual runner is amazing  .
it has made me a better runner .
i like it a lot , only extra i would like to see is some type of reporting software with it .
this is a great tool for analyzing data on an athlete's typical workout  .
as far as the distance travelled , i had no discrepancies when comparing it to my road bike computer  .
i did have a 1  .
5 mile difference when i rode my mountain bike  .
i account this for the fact that the gps is probably measuring horizontal distance travelled (the satellite sees the earth as relatively 'flat' with repsect to the distance i travel vs the distance from the gps to the satellite) while my mtb computer is measuring rolling distance  .
this does not really bother me because i can make a note of this in the training center  .
i mainly look at speed and heart rate  .
i never lost a signal on any of my rides , and it even picks up satellites in my house , which my vista and nuvi fail to do  .
i do wish that the forerunner had a barometric altimeter  .
after a 15 mile mtb ride where i might have 1000ft of elevation gain/fall the training center says i had 8000ft  .
the back    to    start feature is great for back tracking if one gets misoriented on a mtb trail  .
the forerunner would also be great for hikers  .
i also like the autolap feature , which automatically resets to a new lap when you pass a specified waypoint  .
my wife has started using it for running , and the training center supports mutiple profiles .
hi folks ,  .
this is definitely a product you should buy  .
i made the best decision in buying this  .
i am running a marathon in october and i am already 8 weeks into my program running around 12    15 miles on my long runs  .
i is a smoker and could not run 5 miles  .
this is a great product , really motivates you because you can view your heartrate , distance traveled , speed and calories burned  .
get this product  .
it is worth it  .
i purchased the forerunner 305 about three weeks ago  .
i am training for a marathon in january and wanted a gps system to monitor my long runs  .
the forerunner 305 works great unlike other reviewers , i have had no problem with the 305 aquiring a gps signal quickly  .
i have also had no problems with trees/buildings affecting the signal the included software works well , but has limited functions  .
this does not matter that much because you can download your data to motionbased  .
com which has excellent functions analyzing your run overall , i am very happy with the forerunner 305 .
if you want a great watch to analyse your running training    this is it  .
had more than three polar watches the last 10 years and no polar watch can just come close to this great garmin gps watch  .
even not my last polar rs200sd  .
the price is compared to polar very cheap  .
i just recommend the forerunner 305 .
this is the ultimate training tool  .
i can do anything and everything that you could ask for and puts it in a chart and graph for you  .
the only reason i gave it 9 instead of 10 is that sometimes it seems that the speed measurement is off  .
i'll have to delve deeper into that issue  .
this is an awesome product  .
also , i found if for $249  .
99 (look hard) .
i think this workout tool is going to take my exercise program's to the top  .
it receives satellite reception well , even on a pathway that is covered by trees for miles  .
i can change sport settings whenever i want to get different information to read as i workout  .
the heart monitor lets me know what zone i'm in for easy , tempo and speed running  .
i can read my current distance , speed , pace , time , and a lot more quickly and with ease  .
all info is recorded on the device and you can transfer it to the training program that comes with it  .
i could go on and on , but let me just say it's worth the money  .
incredible piece of technology  .
virtually all issues w/ the forerunner 301 have been fixed  .
sensitive enough to maintain a signal under tree cover  .
almost half the size of the original  .
all the screens are customizeable so that one can have 1 to 4 fields on any of 3 screens altimeter is a questionable , but i imagine it's difficult to accurately measure altitude from satellites that are miles overhead  .
most incredible training device i have ever used  .
the ability to program multi    step speed workouts is amazing a bit pricey but well worth it compared to its multi    part competitors , like timex which uses 3 devices to accomplish the same functions    a receiver watch ; a separate gps receiver , the size of a pack of cards ; and a separate data recorder .
great tool that is worth the price to help me really know how far and how fast i'm running  .
helps me not over estimate or underestimate  .
i've also heard the 305 is a little easier to use than the newer 405 , because that has a touch screen dial  .
i is able to get mine at a great price from costco (around $150 after some on    line discount) .
i is skeptical when i first purchased as i had the timex bodylink for years and is pleased with its performance  .
i run frequently on trails with significant tree cover and was not sure if the garmin would lose contact  .
pleasantly surprised with the unit and performance  .
the unit is much larger than the timex wristwatch but you lose the gps armband the timex demands  .
you can really only wear during runs/rides but if i got use to this fairly quickly  .
at times it can take up to 30 sec to get a strong lock on the satellites but once it does , i have never had an issue  .
i took this on the vt50 miler race in central vt which is almost exclusively on single    track through mountainous terrain  .
the signal ranged from fair to poor but the accuracy did not suffer  .
you can upload to motionbased  .
com and it will confirm  .
only downside is battery life if you run ultras  .
on the vt50 , it lasted just over 10hrs but would not last for a 100miler  .
overall , most pleased i ditched timex for this baby .
i haven't had any problems with dropped reception like many other reviewers have had  .
once it gets a signal it always stays connected  .
however , the length of time it takes to require the signal varies a lot  .
occasionally it will pick it up in the first few minutes , but it nearly always takes longer  .
which is frustrating , because i do not want to begin collecting data when i'm already 2 or more miles into my run i've had it get reception in a few seconds i've also run for 50 minutes before it connected i've started turning it on and leaving it on my windowsill 20 minutes before i run so that it has a chance to lock on before i step out the door overall , it's a great tool , and i know it has helped my training considerably , but if you're going to buy it you may have to deal with an average wait of 10    15 minutes before using it  .
i of course have no idea how good reception is in other areas , but from reading other reviews it seems to be uniformly sketchy i'd still much rather run with it than without it , but being forced to wait outside for 10    15 minutes or lose the first 2 miles worth of data has been frustrating .
overall i really love my 305  .
i bought it for trail running so as to not get lost  .
it has tracked me back more than once so its a nice piece of mind to have in the middle of nowwhere , especially if your a woman (men do not worry about getting lost)  .
i also like using it occasionally while cycling a new route and to get the elevation gains  .
not the most accurate heart reat monitor but i do like the strap much better than polar  .
as a triathlete its a bummer that you cannot swim with it  .
fun but not a necessity totally just a toy .
nice product , but don't become too dependent on it the gps performance of the forerunner is in striking contrast to my garmin nuvi (auto gps system) which quickly locks in virtually all conditions  .
so it appears that garmin has the technology they just don't want to package it for runners yet  .
maybe i'll take my nuvi jogging if you do not want to take my word for it then at least make sure that you have the right to return it (with a full refund) until you have a chance to try it out in some cloudy conditions .
i had this beauty for 48 hours before returning it to the store  .
in that time , i ran 2 10    mile runs , measured by the garmin as 12  .
2 miles and 7  .
4 miles , respectively , thanks to some seriously flawed connect    the    dots compensation for the 20    30% of my runs i spent outside of a gps signal i live in los angeles , and i'm used to a little fuzziness and dropped calls when i'm going through some of the hills or canyons , but this is ridiculous  .
i lost my signal in all the expected places , but i also dropped it (twice) on sunset boulevard in downtown la without a cloud in the sky or a tree on the horizon  .
i actually watched it recalibrate my distance traveled in real    time  .
2 miles  .
wait       no  .
oops  .
back to 5  .
this thing is useless  .
thank you , sportmart , for accepting returns  .
i'll just premap my runs on google maps and use a stopwatch and some 3rd    grade division .
i would not recommend this product .
in the month that i have owed the fr 305 i have taken to leaving it at home because it is so hard to get a signal ; i dont even consider it on a cloudy day  .
this morning , under a cloudless sky with minimal trees (108th in riverside park in new york city) , i stood there for 10 minutes while it is trying to locate a signal only to be rewarded with the unit asking if i is in doors  .
giving up i turned it off and on (so it would look again) and then ran three miles south along the hudson river  about as big sky as you are going to get in new york city  .
same question the one time i got it to work , in central park of all places , it seemed to work fine though the pace on two different screens did not agree with each other  .
since the unit is collecting dust in my drawer , i have not spent the time trying to figure out if they are telling me two different things  .
no comment on the hr monitor for the same reason , i never use the thing i am no scientist but it does seem like garmin is asking for trouble by putting contacts for the recharger underneath the unit where it will spend a good portion of its life on a sweaty wrist  .
isnt warm , salt , moisture , and metal a recipe for corrosion  .
too bad , i had high hopes for this unit  .
ill try again a couple more times but suspect will soon give up as it is very distracting constantly looking at my watch to see if it is working  .
seems to me i should drop this all together , map out my distances with google earth and just use a $5 stopwatch  .
anyone want to but an almost new fr 305  .
garmin customer support suggested that i pay more good money to purchase their faulty and unreliable product , without being helpful and giving any decent suggestions  .
of course    i found more help online than from garmin product support  .
sounds to me like they are more interested in making more money than supporting their customers recommendation   find a better product .
my experience is do not buy  .
after a few months unit failed to synch with desktop software , reinstalled everything (on desktop and 305 firmware) , still fails  .
waiting for tech support to get back with me  .
look online , lots of people have this problem also , cadence sensor will not fit on many bikes (mine is orbea opal) with angled chainstay  .
not sure why a gps unit needs spoke sensor for speed , but cant use the cadence sensor b/c not enough clearance between spoke and chainstay if everything on this unit worked as it should , i would really like the product  .
unfortunately , this isnt the case garmin connect (online fitness/route tool) does not work with forerunner 305 .
Love the features and user interface. Wriststrap allows unit to mount on handlebar nicely. Like the desktop software. HR monitor, speed, elev +/-, routefinding are all nice.; Some key features simply dont work or weren't thought out.
able to blaze my own trail and know my distance and time.; none so far. software is so-so
The best interface ..Super Userfriendly..Super GPS . Easy to read while running; mmmmm let me seeee ...um a bit bulky but if can save your life ....what the heck !!
Much more sensitive - works under tree cover in compact unit.; Few - still takes a long time to acquire a signal.
Great reception, compact, allows use of a Heart Monitor; 4 datafield page a little hard to read while exercising
Everything about the product is great, I love it !!!; At times may be slow to find a signal
Great tool with lots of features.. Knowing exactly how slow/fast you're going makes it much easier to push yourself.; Satellite connection time is inconsistent and sometimes takes an absurdly long time.
When you can get a signal to works very well.; No ready for prime time in an urban environment.
I liked this product very mucn until it died suddenly and for no reason.; I was happy with the Garmin until it died on me, in the middle of my 1st marathon (after 27 km). Apparently it lost satellite reception.. After contacting customer support, I reinstalled the SW but it continued to not find the satellite reception.
Relatively compact, good battery life, and feature rich, to say the least.; The biggest problem is the GPS coverage. I was looking for reviews because I was just out today and after my 45 minute run was over I still didn't have sattelite lock. It was a cloudy day in the LA area, but not cloudy enough to rain.
several options for screens, lots of workout options. When it's actaully recieving a signal it's fantastic.; Only works 50% of the time b/c it cannot recieve a signal. It takes anywhere from 3-10 min to recieve signal so don't be in a hurry to show up and run somewhere.
It takes the guess work out of how long and far you've run. Includes a heart rate monitor. Helps to see what you real pace is, super helpful. I've found the device to be extremely accurate. Also, it's very easy to use - the watch and the software.; Sometimes it takes a few mins to sync up with the satellite (2-10 mins when I'm running). I just turn it on outside a few mins before my run. Alsono indicator of the battery life, just a notice when the battery is low and I then have 1-2 hrs left.
