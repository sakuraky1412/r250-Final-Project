reliable  .
for about the past month , i have not been able to figure out which external hdd would be the best for me  .
i saw that best buy is having a sale on this particular hdd , so i went down to best buy and decided to buy it i am so impressed by this product , it absolutely works wonders  .
after taking it out of the box , i is backing up my precious photos within minutes  .
it works flawlessly , and looks beautiful on my desk  .
this hard drive is sleek and super fast  .
it stores large amounts of data quickly and works well on multiple machines it is about the size of a book ; small enough to be portable if needed .
on the mac and on the windows machine no problem  .
works good  .
did not have to install anything .
i just setup the my book essential and am overall pleased with it  .
i have a dell 1  .
5mhz desktop with two hard drives on it  .
i felt i needed to protect my historic family photos and music much better than what i had  .
it has a very quick setup with a front push button that cuts out the hard drive access when i'm performing difficult tasks on my computer and want to insure the safety of my backed up files  .
when i push the button to return it on , all four of my partitions appear back on my my computer screen within 30 seconds , one by one i immediately partitioned the hard drive into four primary partitions when i first got it using xp/computer management and all went well including a format for each one  .
two partitions are 100g and two are about 20    30g each  .
awsome job in sizing how i want my backups to be  .
i personalized each hard drive with its own name i backed up all my personal files including my music/photos for a total of 30g on one of the partitions  .
it took about 9 hours to download  .
after calling wd tech support , it appears they mentioned that since i have the slower 1  .
0 usb ports on my dell 1  .
5g 4300 computer , i would get the slower speed since the my book has 2  .
0 usb compatablity  .
makes sense to me , so i just ordered a 5 port 2  .
0 usb pci card on ebay for $9  .
00 and am expecting it here  .
uploading appeared to be a twice as fast on my brand new dell 1505 notebook that does have the 2  .
0 usb ports  .
so there you go  .
get yourself the faster enhanced 2  .
0 usb ports for the fast up/downloads overall , the feel of the book is plastic and feels cheap  .
there's nothing special to it and the provided software is at a minimal i recommend the my book essentials if you need backup , lots of it .
this hard    drive combines all of western digital's best aspects  .
it has an amazing look , (similar to the xbox) , which allows it to fit in nicely with the black and siver themes with computer companies like dell  .
it is unbelievably quiet  .
i first purchased an inexpensive drive due to rebates , and the next day this went on sale  .
drawing my attention , i looked up revieve on both drives  .
it seems many drives lock up and tend to make whinning noises  .
with nearly a month under my belt with this drive i have no complaints  .
it is stackable and it can sit upright like a book  .
it even comes with four little pads to put on each corner    if you want it flat  .
the wd my book essential comes with a usb and dc power imput in the back  .
(all cabels are included  .
) on the back there is also a kensington security slot  .
(this allows people to lock up their hd like a bike  .
locks sold seperately  .
) when you first connect the drive , it installs all drivers needed  .
imediately  .
fast installation requires no user interaction  .
if you would like you can even install google desktop    (that and acrobat are the only programs optionally installed on your computer  .
) no spacey software is required  .
the drive does not affect pc performance , (however google desktop might , but it is optional  .
) overall , this hard drive is a good buy , which will never let you down  .
from my expertience and research it appears to be the top of the line  .
(other than the mybook pro an premium  .
so far i've had this ext hdd for about 2    3 years and it's given me no problems except for the driver issue , which i think is a problem that's isolated to my retarded comp  .
i know many people who have the same ext and they love it too .
this hard drive works well  .
i have loaded everything on it and transported it half    way around the world with no problems  .
it has no concern with being plugged into my laptop or pc  .
when i shut down my computer , it shuts down  .
likewise when i turn my computer on my only complaint is that it is a little slow and bogs down my computer at times  .
when you save a document , there is a pause while the hard drive spins up to ready itself for a save even if you plan to save it on your computer i think it looks great and recommend it .
this is my first external hard drive , and i'm reasonably impressed with it  .
it's compact and offers all the extra storage space i hope i'll need for a long time  .
i keep all of my itunes library (4 , 500 songs and counting) in it , along with years of photos , and it's only about 10% full  .
i would say that it's a tad slow in moving files from my laptop , but that has not been any sort of major problem .
needed a backup solution    found this slick drive for $100 after rebate installed it with vista home prem no problem  .
picked it right up seems to bottleneck sometimes for no apparent reason  .
moved my windows  .
old file to it after loading vista giving 8 of 10  .
for $100 , it's worth 250gb of space  .
9 would be more speed and 10 would be firewire option .
this drive is pretty sleek , looks neat (like a book with morse code on it for some reason) , has a crazy but cool little circle deal going on , powers down when the comp does , very quite and with all the rebates , discounts and so on makes this one great buy  .
i'd recommend this product to anyone who has large amounts of precious data sitting on one harddrive  .
with this you can just plug it in , back it up , unplug and go  .
feeling safe now that your data is ok even if your hd crashes and burns  .
the only thing is , is that this essential line of my book seems to be the utilitarian version too with only usb to connect with  .
it does write a little bit slow , you do want to format it to ntfs from the fat32 it comes with (this is for compatability reasons , not because they are dumb but because all peripheral drive are fat  .
5 floppy    fat12 , jump drive is fat , zip is fat16 and so on) and if you know that you are gonna need to load a 4 gig file , just format to ntfs before you do  .
i'd really appreciate western digital putting some serial , firewire 400/600/800 or some networking ports on it because usb (and it theoritical speed) combined with the slow write speed make backups a day (or more) process  .
this is nice as it allows a method of having a backup incase of emergency and not having to create multiple backup cd's  .
since it came with no backup/restore software i found an excellent free backup/restore called version backup  .
you can search for it on google and download it  .
its as good or better that what you can purchase  .
my book can be a little slow , but worth the value in costs and assuring a good backup of your entire hard drive .
my wife is not happy when the hard drive in her one year old imac crashed  .
apple took care of the hardware problem , but all her music and photos were gone  .
the photos are gone forever  .
i had not taken the time to teach her the best practices concerning backing up important data  .
i found the 250gb western digital my book on sale and decided to make the investment to solve this issue  .
the hook up and set up is simple  .
i did install the included software , but soon wished i had not  .
scheduled automatic backups were unreliable and very slow  .
i have now uninstalled the wd software and have set up apple's backup program to do the backup of personal data to idisk and the entire home folder to the my book external drive  .
the apple software appears to be more reliable and easier to manage  .
the my book is perfect for what we need  .
i just wish i had done it sooner .
i need help assessing this product  .
i have the wd 250gb essential edition  .
i reformatted the drive as a ntfs  .
and it seems to be running really slow   36  .
17 min to write a 4gb and 1hr 30min to write a 6  .
75gb folder over to the wd hard dive  .
this is much slower then cnet's review of the 500gb version (36min for 10gb) the rep at wd said that the speeds i is finding is normal and the 36min for 10gb is ridiculously fast even though cnet said it is 3 times slower then other brands with the same specs  .
he also said it depended on the type of files being written (the 4gb folder is music)  .
i have a dell inspiron 1100 laptop w/ a 2  .
40ghz cpu , 2  .
39ghz and 256mb of ram  .
the rep also said that external hard drives usually run less then half the speed of you computer  .
what should i think of this all  .
what is your take on it  .
any advice what to do or not to do with this hard drive before i connect it  .
your advice would be greatly appreciated  .
thank you in advance .
has a manual on / off button , but also turns on and off automatically with computer bootup and shutdown unfortunately , it worked great , but then suddenly quit  .
it no longer appears in my computer hard drives list  .
when the computer boots up , the light comes on and the disk starts spinning and it clicks 3 times and then stops spinning  .
the light stays on but my system does not see the drive  .
from what i've read , this seems to be a common problem with this product that occurs anywhere from 1 week to (in my case) 10 months of use  .
the one weekers are lucky  .
my system has an internal 250gb drive which i had just about filled with music and video files  .
i bought the 500gb my book to store all my media files and have had 10 months to move everything over and add even more  .
now it's all gone .
the problem with these sexy (and comparatively expensive) drives is that they just dismount and fail to remount at least once or twice a day  .
both of the identical ones i bought have the same problem  .
it did not happen until after the 90 days (but right after  .
in order to get them to mount , i have to restart my computer and plug the power of the drives in right after the booting tone (mac) and then 50% of the time , they mount  .
if not , i have to repeat until they work i'll never buy a wd item again  .
they should have done a recall .
buy a different drive if you want a dependable one  .
i got my book to back up my files before reinstalling operating windows xp  .
i disconnected the my book before the process , but after windows is not reading it and is telling me that i needed to format the wd hard drive like if it is a new one i tried to call customer service , it will keep you on hold and after disconnect  .
i emailed my questions never got back from wd this product is suppose to be reliable and give you a peace of mind , but once you'll run into problems there is no help the reason i bought it is a suggestion from a friend , who told me later that got no support with his problems as well next time i'll research reviews before i buy  .
i bought drive to backup my work files  .
great design , fairly compact  .
no software included for backups so you have to provide your own  .
worked fine for 1 month but drive failed  .
would not power up rma process costly and at your expense  .
you must ship in anti    static bag (so save box)  .
no communication or response to 4 e    mails i sent  .
not only did i lose 1 month of backups but it cost me quite a bit to ship back recommend if you buy it to do not rely solely on it for at least a few months  .
you have a chance of losing your only copy of something if the drive fails  .
hope replacement is more reliable .
i had no problem getting this up and running , but it kept disappearing  .
finally it died after only a week , right after i finished backing up all my files  .
(of course  .
) it started making the 3    click sound , and i couldn't read a thing       even diagnostics failed  .
wd's solution  .
send it back , we'll replace it  .
good thing i did not have anything really critical on it yet  .
judging by my research on the support forums , this is not an uncommon problem with this unit  .
next time i'll google the support forums before i buy  .
this is unfortunate , because i've always found western digital to be a such a good product  .
i'm sure i'll try them again .
i had all my pictures from a summer in europe on this drive and now for no apparent reason it no longer works  .
i took it in to computer hardware repair experts and they were unable to recover the data  .
do not ever buy a product by this company if you want to keep your data safe .
my western digital essential edition 250gb external hard drive worked for about 2 months long enough to fool me into thinking it is reliable  .
then , one day , it decided to go into a coma  .
western digital has not responded to my questions (and i certainly don't want a replacement  .
) words to the wise   please do not purchase this heart    breaker .
i have been a fan of western digital hard drives for many years , but that ended with this product  .
i purchased an essential edition 250gb drive for my daughter as a christmas gift , by new years it is doa  .
giving wd the benefit of the doubt , i exchanged it for an identical replacement  .
this one made it until early march  .
three clicks and it turns off  .
wd says the drive is bad and there is nothing i can do but return it under a rma  .
they can do nothing about the lost data  .
so much for using this drive for backing up important files  .
i've have had at least a dozen wd drives over the years and never had a failure , they just became obsolete because of their size  .
this product however stay away  .
if i could have rated this drive below a 1 i would have  .
i purchased to back up my computer  .
have other external drives from different makers that have functioned reliably  .
essentially is plug and play to set up  .
it worked fine for one month and then died without warning  .
i is unable to recognize drive on a myriad of computers  .
since it is just over one month old , i must return it to wd for exchange  .
what good is that if you cannot trust the product  .
i received a my book essential edition 160gb as a christmas gift  .
eager as i is when i unpacked the unit and connected it to my pc , i am still waiting for it to power up  .
i've seen good reviews and bad reviews and can not figure if it is a good or bad product  .
if it is working , maybe i would be able to form an opinion  .
for now i am waiting on a reply from wd  .
the support faq does not provide much in terms of recommended solutions  .
i believe this unit is purchased at target  .
regardless of it's origin , it is dead on arival when i hooked it up .
compared to my other usb externals , this thing is terrible  .
it is often as slow as an old fashioned zip drive , and at least 50% of the time , the system will not boot if it is turned on  .
i am extremely sorry i bought this , as opposed to the other hitachi externals i use  .
i have just finished 4+ hours and two timezones with wd support , who are unfailingly polite , only to find out that this 250 gb book is a dud certainly one of the four support engineers i spoke with could have figured that out  .
how many times does a computer have to re    boot and fail in installation  .
from 4  45 edt to 7  45 p  .
m i worked with these folks  .
now , after 8 p  .
i am hold for over 30 minutes to the return support engineer who will probably not be in california but further out in the time zones trying to get a return code number replacements are the only option designed primarily for a pc , i suspect , even if they say it is not  .
this back up drive is a total disappointment and i cannot get a refund just another dud replacement my experience is a tie for incompetence between the product and the ignorant , but polite , support system grrr .
