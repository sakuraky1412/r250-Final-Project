we selected this motel due to the good reviews .
i do not know why we had such a different experience , but we we very disappointed .
even after asking for a quiet room not near any smoking or smoke entrances , we had to pass 3 or more people smoking when we entered the entrance we were directed to in the back .
later when going back to the lobby , both of those entrances were populated with several smokers that showed no regard to people who are allergic to smoke .
the room had a lot of fan and road noise , even though we specifically asked to be located away from the interstate and road noise .
at 2 am , we were awakened by multiple slammed doors , load talking in the room next door and the hall , and heavy marijuana smoke coming into our room .
when we went into the hallway , we smelled lots of cannabis smells coming from the rooms on way to exit .
since this is the first hotel we have stayed in located in cos for some time , maybe this is a problem everywhere , but we did not experience it at the hotel we stayed at the next night , and hung out at the next day , so it may just be this is a popular place for pot heads and smokers .
can not recommend , and guess the other reviews were from smokers .
i noticed the desk clerk who checked us in smelled . . .

i noticed the desk clerk who checked us in smelled of cigarette smoke too , so maybe that should have been a tipoff.
