Pros:. 3 CCD 2 cameras in one need I say more. 
Cons:. None after using it since the week before haloween 2006. 
Summary:. In November I needed to go to Indonesia to gather data. Instead of carrying a still and video camera, and a steadycam that is also a tripod and then my notebook. I decided to order the GS500 at B&#38;H after reading some reviews and specs naturaly for $730, it arrived the day after to lessen the burden of weight and items on my travels. I still own an analog 3 CCD Sony VX3 (beautiful camera by the way) and a VX2000 and some other toys. I really don't get it, how can anybody say anything but PERFECT! Yes! Perfect little camera. Can't compare a $1000 camera with a $20,000 or even twice the price that the GS500 couldn't do, but the opposite is true, can those bulky and expensive ones do what this one can? I took hours, I mean Hour.....s of footage and four 1 Gyg SD's full of data in the sun, indoors, nightime street scenes, and some in next to total darkness interviewing kids in nightlife, all on auto setting and I tell ya, if anyone complaints ... ha...ha ...ha, must be something really wrong with the camera. I mean mechanically or electronically or maybe the battery or the ... is just not working if you catch my drift, 'cause I've almost professional quality data of stills and videos that after editing no one knows that they were taken by a $730 still and video camera. Just like many news footage that are played back almost abusive like in repetition by some networks. I would advice you to buy this little giant, as I did many of my friends. Ah, forgot, just before I went abroad, my kid's friend's dad and I shot our kids singing in choir, guess which one has better video footage from the balcony especially after editing and seeing it on DVD? The GS500 as to it's older brother, yes! My friend's GS400 sitting on a tripod compared to footage shot from GS500 on a steadycam.. BUY THIS CAMERA NOW!.

Pros:. Very good image quality in normal light, much more better than Sony's.. 
Cons:. No manual freedom in control. 
Summary:. If you want do good, near "professional quality" documentary and you have good subject and enthusiasm, this is right camera for mini budget. You don't need better camera if you don't shoot in poor dim situations. Sun through white wall or white moveable fabric is enough lightning for this small camera.. Very natural color saturation. - you can boost it quite easily in your editing sofware because because the basic setting with this camera is fabulous. No Sony-orange over tone.. Not so workable in low lights and extra shotgun mic - then you need ultra sensitive, high quality Panasonic AG-Dvx100A pal DV documentary camera.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic_DVX100. http://dvshop.ca/dvcafe/dv/dvcam.html. 

$$;
Pros:. video quality, image stabilization, battery life, ease of control. 
Cons:. I find no cons to speak of.. 
Summary:. I purchased my GS500 on line for $640 (as compared to the $950 price at Best Buy.) What a bargain! This unit is great for point-and-shooters. I never thought I could get such vivid video on autopilot. Listen to the user opinions, this camera is the best!. 

$$;
Pros:. 16/9 ratio, manual focus, 4 mp stills, accessory shoe, 3CCD, attractive price. 
Cons:. I can not find any, this camera is perfect.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1/4.7 ccd's , True 16:9. 
Cons:. No headphone jack. 
Summary:. This is a great camcorder for the price. If you are looking at the Panasonic PV-GS line of camcorders?. This is how they should be Rated:. 1. PV-GS400 - BUY THE: Sony Handycamï¿½ HDR-HC3 HDV Digital Camcorder, its a better choice, for the money. Fantastic video quility! Downside: Less Manual Controls. Sony requires you to buy, only their Accessories.. 2. PV-GS500 - BUY IT!!!. 3. PV-GS250. 4. PV-GS300 - If money is a problem: Buy this one!. 5. PV-GS150. I dont care what the reviews say ! The 500 should not be compared to the 400! Becuase the 400 is way out of the 500's price range.The 400 is to hard to find , and at the 400's price, you might as well go High-Definition !. If you read the Pro reveiws for the 250 , it got exellent reviews. the 500 , just gets average reviews. This makes no since to me!! If you do a comparison of the two camcorders side by side, The 500 is clearly a better camcorder! But these are the two camcorders that should be compared to each other. I dont care if the 500 is replacing the 400.. Pro's like to compare the 300 to the 250! But it should be compared to the 150. I dont care if the 300 is replacing the 250.These camcorders should be graded on their merits, not by what they are replacing! And thats how I graded them, ON THEIR MARITS!! If you want a great camcorder, at a great price, then buy the 500. I did!! I recieved mine on Oct 13, 2006 . Its a fantastic camcorder!! If you do side by side comparisons of all these camcorders , and forget what the pro reviewers say, and just judge them on the facts. Then I think, you will come up with the same rating, as I did!! I did not give you, great detail, in this reveiw. I will leave that, to the pro reveiwers. But forget the Pro reveiwers opinions, and stick to the facts! And you will find that the 500 wins!! Hands down!! GO BUY THE PV-GS500 NOW!!!.

Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Firewire behind flip LCD screen. 
Summary:. I fell in love with this camcorder. It does nothing but provide top notch quality. I make short films, and will be going to college for cinema. This camera has better quality than my high school's cameras. I have received numerous compliments on the quality of the video, as well as the sound. I am thrilled to have this piece of equipment to take me through college. CNET's review is extremely harsh, I have experienced nothing but pleasure when using this camera. Every penny is worth investing in the PV-GS500. This camcorder is attractive, provides amazing quality, is easy to use, and is compact enough to easily carry around. I absolutely love this camcorder. If you are looking for a camera close to professional quality without hitting the thousand dollar market, this is the way to go.. 

$$;
Pros:. great video and easy to use. 
Cons:. The zoom control is a little awkward and sensitive.. 
Summary:. I am a point and shoot type of person and really find this camera easy to use. I am totally satisfied with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video and picture quality. 
Cons:. I'm still thinking of one.... 
Summary:. Forget the editor's review. He should compare this camcorder to another of the same price. This one here is great! Recordings in dark places are pretty good and the photos pretty sharp! It is an almost perfect camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3CCD, lots of control. 
Cons:. Small LCD, needs headphone jack. 
Summary:. I was in the market for a pro level 3CCD camera, but when I did my research and carefully considered the price vs. performance, the GS-500 made a lot more sense than spending well over $1000 for a prosumer model.. I do documentary and research video, and I can say that without question, the GS-500 does a job at or near the level of much more expensive 3CCD miniDV cameras. If you don't have to have balanced mic inputs, this camera does just about everything a +$1000 camera can do, with the same picture quality, in my opinion.. The only real con I have with it is the lack of a headphone jack, but this can be remedied with a couple of adapters and the auxiliary cable provided with the camera..

$$;
Pros:. Picture and Color Quality are Superb. 
Cons:. Manual Controls are not Easy to Work With. 
Summary:. This camera is by far one of the best cameras around for the price. Awesome picture and color quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. great styling, easy to use, great picture quality. 
Cons:. still pictures not impressive. 
Summary:. This is really a great camcorder for the semi-pro. I use it primarily on auto and it works great every time. Much better video quality then my previous Canon ZR-700. True widescreen, Leica lens, optical image stabilization, great low light and Mac capability, joystick and smart menus make this camera a dream. I do not use manual controls often but when the situation calls for it they are there. The price is right, just be careful that the price quoted includes all the equipment (battery, charger, remote, cables) and not just camera only. Chose this over the new Sony HD because my computer will not burn HD DVDs, and although my computer will edit HD, disk space, processor speed, picture quality and price still made the Panasonic the best choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. The remote operation is great!. 
Cons:. Too short a shoulder strap, I'm using my old one.. 
Summary:. Maybe because this replaces an 8mm 20 year old Sharp, but I think this is one great camcorder,even a ten if I'm pressed. The ease of operation and the very inclusive features make me feel very confident to take it with me to Alaska. As an amatuer I have had to study the book diligently but it is vividly and simply explanatary.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, image quality, great manual controls. 
Cons:. Lacks a $2 headphone jack, harder to grip.. 
Summary:. If it weren't for it's model number being a step up from the GS400, maybe it would stand out as one of the best, if not THE best of it's price range. However, it is constantly being compared to the GS400, which was around $700 MORE people! Maybe if Panasonic kept the 400 around, and added the 500 to the product line as a budget model, the GS500 would receive reviews that really focus on its place and purpose amongst their line of camcorders. Perhaps it was wrongly named. Perhaps the name GS350 would have rendered reviews that compared it to the GS250 or GS300, in which case it would have received raves.. I put this wrongly named camcorder in a class as a very enhanced and improved GS250, especially in the area of image quality. I owned a 250 and it was a dynamite little camera, unless you were indoors. The 500 gives clear, sharp video right down to one 60W bulb in a room (maybe with the shade off, let's be fair). Below that light level, it still produces a sharp image and good color. There will be some noise at these levels, but nothing abnormal, and less than those single chip Sony cameras that are known for their great low light performance. The color and detail in normal and outdoor lighting are stunning. Yes, the auto iris and white balance response is a little slow, but I think that is to give a smoother transition. Not a big deal. Although the external control that the GS400 offered for iris, shutter, white bal. etc. was very pro-like and accessible, the manual controls on the 500 are not that hard to reach. I don't know what the Cnet reviewer was talking about when he said that these controls are four levels deep in the menu. None of the menus on the camera even go four levels deep. To access the iris you just switch to manual, and press the joystick to the left and you're there! If you're already in manual mode, just press the joystick in, and to the left. It takes one second. Or, for quicker access, press the joystick before you start recording and you just have to press left for iris, up for white bal, and right for shutter. Its really very top level and it's not even in the menus. On the GS400 you had to press a button before you could adjust anything with the focus ring anyway.. Why, for the love of Pete, they got rid of the headphone jack and still kept the manual audio level controls, I'll never know. That's like adjusting the iris with no viewfinder. How do I know if the battery on my external mic goes dead, or if I have my finger over the built in mic by accident? (easy to do, by the way). Now, for the stills. They are actually the best I've seen on a camcorder. For everyday shots of family, kids, etc. the quality of the stills is very good. Just don't crop and enlarge the pictures too much or you'll see some poor compression artifacts. The camera seems to lack a third quality level that would bring the stills up to par with any 4 mega pixel still camera indeed. Still, I take stills with it all the time and just by flipping through my photos on the computer, I can't tell which ones were taken with my video camera unless I zoom way in. When ever I take my camcorder with me, I leave my still camera at home and suffer none. Sure beats those horrible camera phone pics everyone loves to take with no complaints.. That all said, this camera is for people like me who couldn't afford $1999 Cdn for a GS400 but still want the pro quality video that it produced. At the end of the day, all ******** aside, you'll get excellent videos without the extra features of the GS400. A note to Panasonic& If you change the model number to GS350, you'll score WAY higher in these reviews because I think the complaining IS really all about the model number..

Pros:. Fantastic colors and image quality!. 
Cons:. Little bulky... only this.. 
Summary:. This camcorder is awsome! Fantastic quality! You'll see imediately the difference of 3 CCDs!!! Colours are fantastic, and the sharpness is simillar to boradcast productions... The price is very nice, affordable. Battery life is ok, you'll not need extra one, the unit that comes with GS500 is enough for a regular user. This camcorder is the number one!.

Summary:. Comments by friends who saw it was the great color reproduction.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent video capabilities and quality.. 
Cons:. At this price none ... but headphoe jack would be nice.. 
Summary:. This is an incredible camcorder. Like the last reviewer, I am experienced in computer/digital stuff. I was actually expecting indoor video to be poor (like many camcorders) ... I was impressed though.. The main review gives it a 6.8, but don't be put off by that. The review compares it to its predecessor and not other camcorders at its price. This is a much less expensive model than the GS 400, but has exactly the same optics etc. it just loses some manual function to the menus, and the phones jack (can rig one up through external mic usage) ... and the menus are a pleasure to operate. Read the GS400 review and take off some of the manual controls and adjust the price and thats what the GS500 is.. Bought from Beach Camera for $735. Shipped from NJ to CA, 1 day from order to delivery, for $27 with ALL accessories! This online merchant gets my definite thumbs up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best Color/Sharpness/Clearity at This Price Range. 
Cons:. Must Have an Additional Wide Angle Adapter. 
Summary:. As an highly experienced video/computer user, I consider PV-GS500 one that provides the image of best color/sharpness/clearity in both video and still among all camcorders of the similar price range. Manual control is not a critical issue for the equipment because it should take a professional model for the situations that require manual control to gain quality.. 99% of the camecorder users do not shoot manually any way. Otherwise, the point-and-shoot film/digital cameras wouldn't have taken over the market.. Having 16:9 image better than its 4:3 is a great advantage. This is a most logical path before the whole world turns into HDTV in a few years. If you still not know, the 4:3 is venishing.. I havn't found anything better for the same price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding pixel-count, A large 1/4.7 inch CCD, Widescreen LCD, Focus Ring. 
Cons:. No headphone jack. 
Summary:. I've used this camcorder several times for class projects and it gave me amazing video quality. The pro-cinema mode is a very nice feature and having a focus-ring really helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. could not find any. 
Summary:. was really in the market shopping for pvgs400 could not find one was a little worried about buying 500 being its so new but so far very happy. 

$$;
Pros:. Awsome picture if its anything like the 400. 
Cons:. Too many GS400 features missing like a HEADPHONE JACK, manual controls and AV digitizing.. 
Summary:. I'm trying to replace my GS400 which was just stolen (insured), and it seems that the only MiniDV "consumer" camcorder that still contains almost all the Video features of the 400 is the Canon GL2 (I think there are some hard drive units but who wants to edit mpeg2?).. And to fill in for the 400's Still features which the GL2 cannot fullfill...the Canon PowerShot S2 IS.. So about $3500 worth of gear Canadian to replace what I got for $1950 a year ago.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright colors when well iluminated, fast video capture/editing. 
Cons:. bad, dark video in normal lighting conditions, slow response, lack of controls, small screen, half descent pictures at 4mp, over-saturation of pictures with flash. 
Summary:. I expected better from this model and from this prices range. I just got the PV-GS500 3 days ago and I'm contemplating changing it. The video is impressive if you have great lighting conditions, but indoors with regular lightbulbs, it's unacceptable. The flash over-saturates subjects giving discolored grainy pictures. Some cheaper cameras have bigger zoom lenses. The pictures at maximum resolution produce low quality photos. Switching back and forth between picture mode and video mode can be a waste of time if you need something quick. Other camcorders can do it on the fly or right on top of the video as an added effect. If Panasonic pays attention to customers, they'll have a great model for next year. Over all, the video capture and editing portion of it was easy and fast, but for the price, I expected more. Unfortunately, the competition is on the same boat and Panasonic is among the best any way.. 

$$;
Pros:. picture quality excellent. 
Cons:. lighting is terrible, no automatic shutter lense closure. 
Summary:. As I expected the quality of the 3CCD is excellent. However, the camera had a very difficult job adjusting automatically to lighting within the house. I tried to tape a child's christmas play and could not believe the terrible time it had adjusting to different light levels in different rooms. I would never expect this from a $900 camera. Also very disappointed there is no automatic light with the video feature. Video taken at dinner table w/low light was terrible. My 9 year old panasonic VHS camcorder did a much better job. Very Dissappointed and returned!.
