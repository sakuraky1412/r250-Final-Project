0 out of 5 stars gives strange directions, July 6, 2009
When it comes to directions, I'm horrible .
directions routing are perfect .
Directions were easy to see and understand .
spoken directions are crystal clear .
My new Garmin 255w had very Easy Set Up, Accurate Directions to locations, User Friendly Unit to anyone in my vehicle who tried it .
The directions provided have all been quite accurate thus far .
Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
