$$;
Pros:. I've had no issues with it. It's worked right every time. Easy to use, front-mounted controls are a pleasure. I very much appreciate that you get the viewable area, as advertised. Set it and forget it really applies to this gem of a display.. 
Cons:. Its difficult to come up with a legitimate con on this. It wouldn't be fair to complain about features and functions of the high-end models.. 
Summary:. The pricing was excellent, the performance is still as good as it was on day one. Acer raises the bar on reasonably priced displays. It does one thing and it does it well. I'll take that any day over others that have more features.. When you want good sound you buy speakers, when you want more usb ports you get a hub. When I want a good display at a reasonable price, I buy an Acer.!. 

$$;
Pros:. Have used this LCD for over two years with no issues! Crisp display, turns on very fast, nothing bad to say!. 
Cons:. screen resolution could be a bit bigger, but for the price you must sacrifice SOMETHING!. 
Summary:. If you're looking for a 22" LCD monitor for a great price this is your best bet. The first one I bought had a dead pixel in the center of the screen after unpackaging.. I quickly exchanged it and have had no issues with this one for over two years!. 

$$;
Pros:. Every pixel worked, still do 10 months later. Brightness &#38; contrast are more than I need. (I work in a well lit office with no glare.) They are adjustable, as are size, alignment, etc. Fairly intuitive menu. Came with all the cables I needed.. 
Cons:. Switching between two inputs (one analog, one digital) requires several button pushes, but it automatically recognizes the first source that comes on. This is not much of a Con.. 
Summary:. A fine value - excellent performance as a computer monitor. No quality or performance problems. I felt more productive immediately. If you haven't switched to wide screen, give it serious thought. I'd buy another one just like it if I needed another wide screen monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Responsiveness, color depth, size.. 
Cons:. The stand is somewhat bland in design, but who cares!. 
Summary:. I bought this monitor at a COMPUSA Thanksgiving sale. It was $200 before the $30 rebate! I have used it for 2 months now with no regrets. It has excellent color depth &#38; contrast, DVI capable, the controls are easy, auto adjustment and quick response.. This monitor is an excellent value for the price paid!. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear, Cheap, Big. 
Cons:. No Frills. May need to adjust your settings before use.. 
Summary:. This monitor is amazing!! Big, bright, and sharp. Not to mention, affordable. Text was a little fuzzy at first, but a little tweaking to the setting cleared that up right away. Highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Never had any problems with it so, everything.. 
Cons:. Would've been nice if it had plexi-glass, but that's just me, otherwise nothing.. 
Summary:. Great monitor, got it cheap and works great!. 

$$;
Pros:. dvi-d. widescreen. crystal clear. 
Cons:. 5ms response time. sometimes distorts images because of the widescreen (only important for high detail work). 
Summary:. i got mine at $200, and it's great, i love it.. the only thing is sometimes there is the imagine distortion, but that is only an issue for those of you who need every detail, like photo editing.. 

$$;
Pros:. I purchased this product through an Office Depot Black Friday Deal. The colors and Clarity are outstanding for the money. Great Deal!. 
Cons:. I am not sure how long it will last, but as of now there are no cons.. 
Summary:. I upgraded from a CRT monitor and this monitor is excellent. There is a lot of viewing area and the picture on the screen is very good once it is adjusted to 1680x1050. If you need a bare bones monitor, this would be the one for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. great value, performs well, good quality. 
Cons:. no 'extras'. 
Summary:. everything's great so far, no dead pixels, easy functionality. 

$$;
Pros:. Very bright &#38; colourful. 
Cons:. Almost no screen tilt-swivel adjustment. 
Summary:. Although my computer can't handle it's top resolution, it does very well with the lower res settings. The clarity for hi-resolution photos or HD-quality video is simply REMARKABLE!. The only other monitor considered when this was purchased was the HP line. Their outer appearance and screen-finish is much nicer... but who is willing to pay that extra $100 or more for it?. There were 19" LCD flat-panel monitors that were running the same price for what I'd paid for mine... $229. It feels like a steal at that price!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Super sharp, great picture quality on everything I have had on it. 
Cons:. None that I can see. 

$$;
Pros:. Moderately low price, widespread availability. 
Cons:. May need video card upgrade to take full advantage. 
Summary:. I got this from Office Depot for $249.95 (as listed on web site). I found an Office Depot close by that had it in stock but in store price was $269.95. After showing WWW listing it was reduced to lower price. It pays to ask. You can find it cheaper but then you pay shipping. I just paid tax. Six of one, half dozen of another. Great image, lots of real estate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great clear video, no delay, perfect for games and DVD viewing.. 
Cons:. The base is a little small and can be shaky if on on a solid desk.. 
Summary:. I got it on sale for $250 and could not be happier. I have been using it for about 6 months now and have had no issues at all. Very good product and don't need to pay Dell or HP prices.. 

$$;
Pros:. All of the above!!! Very good!. 
Cons:. Can't adjust the pitch very well.. 
Summary:. This is what I am looking at right now and it is a great monitor. It is a wide screen, great color, great quality, never gets hot, light weight every thing is good about it.. Just one thing. It is hard to adjust the pitch of the screen. It can be done, just that it is stiff.. Get one for FREE!!! Have a look at this video first:. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFKYVE__Mug.

$$;
Pros:. Quality at low price. Large screen size.. 
Cons:. No problems.. 
Summary:. It does what I need it to do for under $200. Clear images, no dead pixels, big improvement over my 19" LCD. I don't use it for games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, clear, sharp images and excellent performance for a low price. 
Cons:. More adjustment options for the stand would be nice. 
Summary:. I use more expensive Dell and Viewsonic LCD monitors at work, but I much prefer my Acer 22-inch widescreen at home. It's picture is better in every way. I have good speakers and plenty of USB ports, so I didn't want to pay for features I don't need. The stand, for me, is plenty stable. I wish it had height adjustment, but that hasn't been a major issue. This is the first LCD monitor I've purchased for home use and I couldn't be happier with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its big, great picture. 
Cons:. Grey light in black images, although it really isnt a big deal. 
Summary:. I just bought this monitor today from officedepot for $179.99, $195.00 after tax (discount available online by selecting instore pickup). So far I'm very impressed. The picture is outstanding and I have no dead pixels. I initially thought I would run this with my Samsung 940bw with dual monitors although because of the size of this one I think I have enough room to sell the samsung. The grey light as many have reported is present when the screen is completley black only. The way I see it, if I'm looking at an all black screen there isn't anything to see anyway, so who cares. This is a very minor problem which is greatly outweighed by the image quality. The grey light only occurs in the top and bottom of the screen and goes up about 2.5cm which is not much (I am also used to this on my laptop display). HD video and Windows Vista looks great. Definitely glad I picked it up, and I have two weeks to return it for any reason (which I do not foresee).. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality. 
Cons:. No height adjustment. 
Summary:. No crappy speakers attached, which some may think is a "con" and no USB hub, which some may also consider a "con". I need neither of those, so I do not consider the lack of them to be either a "pro" or "con". The picture quality is great.. I went to Office Depot and asked them for one of these, because their website said the local store had them, but there were none on the shelves. The salesman entered the Office Depot part number into their computer and the price came up as $179! Needless to say, I bought one, and when the cashier scanned it, it scanned as $179, which indicates that it wasn't some weird employee-only price or something. So if you are in the market for a larger, wide-screen LCD monitor, check this out. However, you will probably need to go to a brick-and-mortar Office Depot store.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, big, cheap, very clear, HDCP, great viewing angle, no dead pixels so far.. 
Cons:. Stand not adjustable, no hard button to switch between inputs.. 
Summary:. Got this monitor for my Xbox 360 and for watching high definition movies on my computer. The quality is amazing. Super bright screen, sharp details, minimal backlight bleeding and at a very affordable price.. I would have loved to have a button to switch between the analog and digital inputs, but you quickly get used to using the menu. The built in presets are decent but if you want maximum quality from the monitor you should adjust it your self.. The stand is not adjustable at all but the viewing angle is great so it doesn't really matter. I still would have loved to be able to adjust the height though.. Overall this monitor is amazing. It has a few downsides but picture quality and price make up for theme. Of course there are better monitors out there but at this price you simply can't beat it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very bright, great value for the money, no light leakage. 
Cons:. Lack of custom adjustments, color accuracy. 
Summary:. For what I paid for ($199.00 after rebates at OD), this is a great monitor. Very bright, good quality display for text, but unfortunately it was just too big for my needs. Only need 20 monitor.. Couple of minor issues: once it is assembled, the stand base cant be taken off which makes for awkward transportation or in my case store return (this model was made in China as opposed to one made in Taiwan that can be taken apart).. Plus the monitor is very bright and there are not many options to tone it down without sacrificing sharpness, ease of reading text or color accuracy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning Colors, Extremely Sharp, Superb Imaging. 
Cons:. Not a One other than lack of height adjustment. 
Summary:. In my work in video and graphics production, I need a monitor that has extremely accurate colors, just the right amount of saturation and a monitor with significant clarity.. I've used or tested the majority of LCD monitors on the market and the Acer 22" has all of the above qualities, period.. I have followed the advances in LCD technology and it is amazing just how far - and how fast - LCD monitors have come. I have yet to see a monitor - especially anywhere near this price range - that even comes close to this one.. Go into any store where you can see side to side comparisons (assuming they are all reset to default) and I doubt you would find a sharper, cleaner, richer image without the jaggies present in many LCDs. Whatever it is that Acer did to make this an outstanding monitor, they did it right. Anyone in the market for a new monitor should give this a close look. I recommend this monitor highly!. 

$$;
Pros:. just perfect. 
Cons:. non yet i see only positive. 
Summary:. the 221w is my 2nd acer wide screen: loved my first one so much had to buy another 6 months later for other lap top!. 

$$;
Pros:. Big, Cheap, Vivid Color, Clean Text, DVI Cable included. 
Cons:. No Extras (Speakes, USB ports, Componet input. 
Summary:. I just bought this today from Office Depot for $199. So far I am very pleased with the way it looks. I don't know what two of the other readers are talking about bad text. Either they have it set up wrong, Bad New Monitor or their hardware does not support this monitor. I had a 10 year old 19" iiYama 450 Pro (very high end graphics)prior to this and I was surprised at how little I lost in terms of color.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Monitor. Great Price.. 
Cons:. No composite for HDTV. 
Summary:. This is an absolutely crystal clear clean monitor. I compared the clarity to many many other and this still beats them out, plus the price is remarkable for what you're getting. Best bang for your buck hands down!. 

$$;
Pros:. Big, bright, clear.. 
Cons:. Can't tilt to portrait mode.. 
Summary:. For $300, you can't beat it. It's a very nice monitor. I have been using a 15" CRT for a long time and it really affecting my eye sight. This LCD monitor is bright and clear, very easy on the eyes. What more can I ask for the money. Hmm, perhaps a rotate stand for portrait mode?. Rich.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Price, Easy to use, Good for Gaming. 
Cons:. Not as flashy as some of your high dollar monitors. 
Summary:. I got this monitor for gaming... even though its not as fast as some of your 2ms response monitors... my brain and eyes dont work that fast and I dont really see the difference. Overall... Acer built a winner with this one!. 

$$;
Pros:. As this review is somewhat "dated", I purchased this Monitor about a year ago,. PRICE is Cheap!. A LARGE Monitor, Takes up ALOT of Real Estate,no ghosting, that does what is advertised.. I've not had any problems after a year of my purchase.. 
Cons:. Stand "seems" Flimsy, even though it isn't, a HUGE plus would be if the Stand Would allow the Monitor to swival, up/down, side to side... 
Summary:. For anyone thinking of getting a Larger Monitor, or someone, that is Making the jump for thier first LCD from CRT,for the first time, I strongly recommend this Monitor.. No Frills, ie: speakers/USB etc, this Monitor is all screen.. No Ghosting, Side-view Angle is fairly good.. 22" of Real Estate on your desk Top.. It's also lightwieght.. Vibrant Colors, It is BRIGHT!. This monitor has enhanced My Gaming Experience for NASCAR SIM Racing to another Level, from a Former user of a 19" CRT Flat screen, the Difference is Like Night and Day... The Menu is EZ, simple to use, self-explantory, menu instructions.. Movies, Games are a pleasure to see/watch on this Monitor.. With Prices now below the 200 mark for this 22" Monitor... It's hard not to make the jump for this great,No Frills LCD.. I would recommend this to anyone Making thier first purchase.. Even though the stand seems "flimsy", it's not, and will stand up to abuse, or being moved around often.. I've owned this Monitor for a year thus far, NO dead Pixels/Nor Problems, has survived Power Outages/Surges... Cleaning Abuse from My wife.. (Most Important)... If the stand was better, where you could moved the screen around or "Swival" it, I would give this 5 Stars... But, just 4. 

$$;
Pros:. Great color, perfect size. 
Cons:. cant tilt or rotate. 
Summary:. This is a really great monitor, much better than my last which was a sony 17" lcd. It has great color and I got a great deal on it. A 22" for $200 thats a great deal especially since it is of pretty good quality. Its not the most amazing monitor in the world but it is definitely a good one that is low priced.. 

$$;
Pros:. low price, easy assembly, great picture. 
Cons:. few, if any, adjustments; cheap stand; awful manual. 
Summary:. I have the AL 1916W, which is in the same family of products. I got it at Circuit City for $179 after rebates, and I've had it for 10 months. So far it has given me no trouble, just delivered a beautiful picture when required, (landscape photos) that is also accurate. The text is also very readable no matter what font I am using. It is also very good for videos, though I don't care for watching them on a computer monitor. My only complaints with it are the lack of adjustments to the stand, and to the picture, and it's complete no frills nature. I must also admit that, given my horrible experiences with Acer computers, I am VERY surprised it hasn't blown up by now. And I have to mention the "manuals". They send 2, "AL1916W LCD Monitor" and "Acer eColor Management." Each is 44 pages long. The ENGLISH in each manual is TWO PAGES, which is maybe barely enough to get the basics across to someone who is computer illiterate. To me it says that the company DOES NOT care enough about their customers to send out a well written, understandable owner's manual, leaving it instead to 4 pages and a disc that, oh wait, I have to get the monitor working before I can find out what's on the disk!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It works as advertised!. I use both the VGA and DVI inputs, from a Mac with OS X and and an HP desktop running Windows XP.. 
Cons:. No problems - but then, I'm not picky about super performance as you might be.. 
Summary:. I have had Acer monitors in the 1990's that did not work, that I returned - and was willing to try this time, based on the price, and that it had both VGA and DVI.. It worked right out of the box with Windows XP, using the VGA hook-up. Then, when I brought home a MacBook, I hooked it up with a DVI cable, and VOILA! Instantly on the Mac I had two screens - what a nice surprise.. So my hookup works well for me. I put the XP to sleep when I want to use both screens on the Mac, and I use the XP, with the monitor, when I need it. Works like a champ.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good value (if you get it at the right price). HDCP-compatible DVI port. 
Cons:. 5ms response time. 
Summary:. I got this monitor for just $179 from a recent sale at Office Depot. If you're looking for a value monitor, I highly recommend frequenting the deal sites like SlickDeals or TechDealDigger.com (the latter is really solid on LCD displays). Monitor prices are falling and retailers are constantly running closeout specials. Be patient and you'll save yourself a lot of money with deals like these http://www.techdealdigger.com/hot-deals/monitors-sale/88. 

$$;
Pros:. $179, bright, good colors, bigggggg!. 
Cons:. control buttons not easy to use, not the best resolution. 
Summary:. I'm writing this because I read somewhere that these monitors' 1680x1050 wouldn't work well on older Macs. Well it works great with both my G4/533 and my Intel Mini. The price is amazing as Office Depot is clearing this model out. I also read that the angle wasn't adjustable but it does move a few degrees which an lcd needs. Graphics and photos can look either crystal clear or blah depending on the source. I'm getting used to the big real estate and loving it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice Widescreen. 
Cons:. It just one day died on me..no power!!. 
Summary:. It just crashed on me one day and wouldnt come on, tried several power cords and power outlets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice size, easy to use, the frame is a lovely shade of gray, the on/off button is easy to find, sturdy base, quiet.. 
Cons:. After 9 months of use, the screen randomly became blurry without warning.. 
Summary:. After 9 months of daily use, the Acer AL2216W LCD Monitor screen suddenly went blurry - a tiny pixilated blur that seemed to jiggle. This slight blurriness caused the screen to be unreadable and caused headaches when viewed for longer than 1 minute. I shut off the monitor, and after starting it, the blurriness was gone.. A few weeks later, the monitor was suddenly blurry again. Again, I shut it off. After several restarts of the monitor, finally the blurriness was gone again.. I'm going to try to return it before the warranty expires. A monitor should last longer than 9 mos! This Acer replaced a horrid Samsung which had a floating screen message. Can anything be built to last longer than 9 months?. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price. 
Cons:. Not real good looking. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price for general computer viewing and watching DVDs.. Good color and contrast.. 
Cons:. I use it in portrait mode for ease of reading web pages and working on large images. I have to stay right in the middle to see the proper light and color.. 3/4" light white band crosses the screen, lft - rght every 1.5 seconds.. Black screen not black. 
Summary:. I got the best of what I could afford after researching needed specifications. Had a Soyo that had stuck pixels (but had a better viewing angle) and swapped for another Soyo that I tested before leaving store and it had more stuck, red pixels. Got this Acer for the same price as the Soyo. No dead or stuck pixels, but that band crossing the screen and the viewing angle are bothering me. Saving my pennies for a better monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big and cheap.. 
Cons:. Blurry text, VERY BLURRY TEXT. Looks cheap, real cheap.. 
Summary:. I thought it was me and my eyes until I returned the monitor and got my self a Samsung instead (alas, for 200 euros more). True, my setup is not the most straightforward in the world but my new monitor handles it just fine. This ACER monitor is WSXGA+ and I connected it to my laptop which is SXGA+. My laptop's card handled the resolution fine but the brightness was uneven, text was very blurry (in some areas on the screen it was less blurry than others, but it wasn't really sharp) and the flickering, especially with a dark background, could make you seasick. I'm not anti ACER in any way - in fact my laptop (the most important component of my setup) is ACER and it's the best I've ever had. So please hear me out.. I decided to buy a large screen after working on a 24" iMac for about a week. Now that I have a 21" Samsung monitor (215TW-WSXGA+), no more Mac envy for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. VERY BRIGHT AND CLEAR. 
Cons:. 75% FAILURE RATE SAME PART NUMBER #55.L61V2. [MAIN BOARD/INVERTER BOARD]. 
Summary:. WE PURCHASED 4 OF THE AL2416W MONITORS IN 11/2006 AND HAVE HAD A 75% FAILURE RATE. EACH TIME WE SEND THEM IN FOR REPAIRS, IT IS THE SAME PART THAT IS REPLACED 55.L61V2 [MAIN BOARD (GP) VL-2401]. WHEN THE FIRST MONITOR CAME BACK IT WAS NOT AS BRIGHT AS THE MONITOR IT SAT NEXT TO. WHEN THE SECOND MONITOR CAME BACK IT WAS EITHER ASSEMBLED WRONG OR DAMAGED IN SHIPPING, AS THE BACK FACE PLATE WAS POPPED UP IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER. THE REPAIR FACILITY ONLY RESPONSE WAS TO SEND IT BACK AGAIN. WE COULDN'T AFFORD THE DOWN TIME. WHEN YOU TRY TO GET A CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER, THE REPAIR PEOPLE ONLY HAVE AN ADDRESS. MY GUESS IS THEY ARE AN OUTSIDE REPAIR FACILITY, AS THE RETURN PAPER WORK NOW HAS ACER, GAETWAY, AND E-MACHINES ON THE LETTERHEAD. FINALLY, EVEN THE EMAILS LISTED ON THE ACER WEBSITE FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE COME BACK AS UNDELIVERABLE. HAVING TO SEND OUT FOR REPAIRS 3 TIMES IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS HAS COST US BOTH MONEY FOR SHIPPING AND DOWN BUSINESS TIME.. 

$$;
Pros:. none, only good if you play SEGA games in your PC. 
Cons:. slow, fuzzy picture, the brightness control is not good.. 
Summary:. end of the story pay little more and you can get a better one than Acer AL2016W.. I got to change twice and the third time different brand.I thought acer were good but not this time.In the beginning it looks nice and nice Picture Q. but if you like to use it for 6 months or 500hrs then you will see the "good" side of the Acer. DON"T BUY this Acer AL2016W. 

$$;
Pros:. Comes with DVI cable. 
Cons:. Image quality is unusable for me.. 
Summary:. I bought one of these and really wasn't expecting a lot due to the price ($199 at Office Depot). I was still disappointed. I set the resolution, the refresh rate and played with all the onscreen adjustments (yes even the clock). Small text is unreadable and gray shades are all blurred together. The forward and back buttons in IE7 look horrible. My second monitor which is a very old washed out 17" M70 CRT ($99 cheapo) looked much better sitting next to it. It is much worse than my failing 19" MAG CRT ($129 new). I shouldn't have been surprised since it's image is on par with some of the 17" ACER LCDs I've used before. I'm returning it tomorrow. I was using the analog connector. It didn't appear to have any stuck pixels.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low Price, HDCP compliant. 
Cons:. Too Fragile, Flimsy Stand, Stuck Pixels. 
Summary:. I purchased this monitor for just over $250. I returned it after it sprouted two dead/stuck pixels in under a week of use. I bought the Samsung 22 inch LCD (226BW) for a hundred dollars more and couldn't be happier. No dead pixels and much better quality casing/stand/picture. I will say that Acer has great customer service, but who wants to send their monitor out for repair all the time?...Not me. 

$$;
Pros:. It Worked Good for the first month. 
Cons:. Lack of Customer service. 
Summary:. I bought this monitor around the end of January. It setup and worked good for a little more then a month, then it was dead. None of the customer service information in the box was correct. No phone number and website had changed, but I found it on line. Filled out all the online info... returned it and waited.. got it back still didnt work. I have spent hours talking to people from Acer on the phone. The third person admitted their repair notes show a screw up in there information so they just sent it back with out checking it. They sent a call tag to ship it back the 3rd time and that took a week to get the call tag. I have only had the monitor for about one month of the three I have owned it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks good. 
Cons:. Does not work for long. 
Summary:. I purchased my monitor in September and have had to return it AT MY OWN EXPENSE 2 times. Acer will not provide me with a new monitor. The monitor makes a popping sound and stops working. The 2nd time, it also had a burning smell..
