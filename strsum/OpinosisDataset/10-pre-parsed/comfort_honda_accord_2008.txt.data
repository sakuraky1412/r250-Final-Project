awesome interior with great comfort .

uncomfortable in camry, had a nissan before, rough ride .

comfortable, good in snow, easy to drive .

comfort inside is better than expected .

solid build, comfortable interior, smooth ride, fuel efficient averaging 27 .

comfort is my only real complaint .

my family of 5 can comfortably ride in this car .

absolutely got a great car, roomy, comfortable, great ride for a nice price .

the seats are extremely uncomfortable .

i fit in the coupe comfortably .
