Pros:. FM Transmitter, accurate routes, announces street names, bluetooth, data updates. 
Cons:. can't search for POI with out a category selected, Traffic only really picks up accidents and not heavy traffic.. 
Summary:. I looked at several different types. The 720 was a little more than I wanted to spend for my first GPS but I am finding that its well worth it. I found with the latest upgrades to my Black Berry Curve cell through T-Mobile that I can now transmit data via bluetooth. T-mobile should be able to help out with the information on setting it up. just remember wap.voicestream.com. When you set it up manually it will work like a charm. The Bluetooth is wonderful too. No more fumbling for a phone while driving down the interstate. Screens are very user friendly and the MP3 player is awsome when hooked up through the FM transmiter to my radio. Overall I give the fast 720 a big two thumbs up!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth, fm transmitter, battery life, voice input (see my post), mapshare corrections, latest map guarantee. 
Cons:. FM transmitter should have been little more louder, provide detailed user manual (there is one in the cd though), otherwise no complaints!!!!!!. 
Summary:. This product is simply awesome. I had made up my mind for this but in the showroom I saw the LG LN790 whose maps seemed better looking and colorful and supported video playback. It was also 399$ under promotions. The tomtom lay showing its black and white map. I bought the Tomtom. Don't be fooled by the black &#38; white maps; as soon as you come on the road you'll experience colourful maps on the great 4.3" widescreen. Read the last two points to see how you can make this feature packed product even higher end.. 1. Bluetooth: Although 2 of of my phones were not in the compatibility list, all handsfree functions work. The list is only for data services and although i didnt try on mine , i think my non compatible phone paired up for data with the showroom piece. The mic is very good handsfree calls work flawlessly. No complaints.. 2. FM transmitter: Another great feature that attracted me is the fm transmitter.(although you can get a bulky external one for $10-20) The volume is a little low on the radio but when on 50-75% of my car's volume, it works flawlessly. MP3's can be played through your car audio too and i love the way it pauses the sond when giving navigation instruction. 3. Screen, Music and Media: Awesome 4.3" screen. Same like the psp screens. MP3 and .aa audiobooks can be played. Internal speaker very loud and clear and sound can also be output through fm, bluetooth and earphone jack. txt files and fully saved webpages can be viewed too. Several guides like first aid and car repairing come with the product.. It has 2gb flash memory in which maps and everything is stored so the product works very fast. There is also an sd card input if you want to expand your memory.. 4. Navigation: The product performs its main task very well and accurately. As soon as you miss a turn, it immediately reroutes. Several option for route planning too. Warns of turns well in advance and reads out streets names and distances.. 5. Interface and voice: Good interface but you have to get used to it. Love the QWERTY keyboard option and input very easy.Other than power button, there are zero external buttons so that you dont have to mess with buttons while driving. However external volume controls would be nice. Volume is change with a touchscreen slider. Battery life is also good. There is no detailed manual in the box but there is one on the cd. I discovered most functions myself though.. Voice is clear and there are many voices. It does pronounce street names and the speakers are much louder than other gps incl the LG.. 6. Mapshare: Missing/wron POIs and map errors are a big concern in the gps field. Mapshare allows you to correnct errors, add POIs, edit locations, block traffic, change rad names and several other options. The feature is right in the device and corrections can be made without connecting to pc. Once enabled, you can download correction's from other users and upload your own automatically when connected to pc free of cost. You dont need to buy maps and buy POI to reduce errors unlike some companies. The already 6 million POI is getting bigger and accurate with this feature in this product.. 7.Connectivity and updates: Very easy to use software which also enables you to operate device from pc. Checks for updates as soon as you connect. Software updates are free and the latest maps can be downloaded for free within 30days from first use as often (of course new maps come out in very long intervals so within 30 days you will download only once)as a part of the latest map guarantee. Some other companies products ship with old maps and then you have to purchase new ones.. 8.***Voice recognition!!!***: No specs show that this feature has voice input. But once you download the 1.7gb v7.10 latest maps (tomtom provides them for FREE within first 30 days as part of latest map guarantee) and then paste a self made notepad file called support_asr.dat with just the number "1" typed in the file, in your gps's ASR folder: You get voice recognition and it works flawlessly. Thisi snot a modification but just enables the voice recognition which comes with the lates maps.. 9. Video playback: This was a tempting feature in the LG. But a third party software from mobilnova.com adds video support to the any tomtom without messing with it. Of course this is not a free tool but it is inexpensive plus you can download a free trial which plays upto 2 min videos. Compression is great and the videos look awesome on the 4.3" 16:9 widescreen.. Overall a great product with so many features, great performance and a good price. I can write loads about this great product and it is highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear, Crisp Graphics, User friendlieness. Map Share is awesome!. 
Cons:. Battery life is about 1 hour or less with most features on and about 3 hours with most features off. So unit has to be plugged in all the time.. 
Summary:. Alot of in-depth review but some reviewers missed alot of key things. The Tom Tom 720 is a much better device than you would think.. Things I want to add.. 1. The menu layout is completely user changeable so you don't have a cluttering of numbers and information on the bar. The reviewer doesn't mention that although he criticizes the 720 for having a cluttered info bar. That is simply a factory default setting that anyone can change.. 2. The map layout, colors and ease-of-use is much much much better than both Garmin's and Magellan. The company I work for allows us to have private car service home when working late and I've seen and studied just about every brand of GPS in the various Town cars during my 1 hours commute home from NYC to Westchester. So I've gotten a sense of how cities and suburbs/rural areas are displayed on all these GPS units and the Tom Tom brand has the best, cleanest graphics. The reviewer fails to mention that when said and done, quickly understanding the screen graphics during a quick look up from the road during your journey is just as important as anything else.. 3. The 720 also allows you to pick alternate routes based on how and when you want to get to your destination. The factory default settings on the 720 will obviously be way off and will have you driving around alot more than you would want to. Which is why I suspect the reviewer detracted from the 720 mapping intelligence when paired alongside the Garmin's Nuvi and Magellan's GPS units. I'm 100% sure he was routing under the factory settings so the 720 gave him longer and incorrect routes. Simple adjustments to your 720 factory settings will allow the unit to pick the best routes based on where you live and drive(whether in a city, near highways, or rural areas). 4. Outside of GPS function the 720 has a myriad of feautures that are on par if not better that Garmin's pricier Nuvi 700 line. In his Nuvi review he praises the Nuvi for having the "Where Am I" feature as if it is a rare and super cool thing. Whiles the 720 has the same features and he fails to praise the 720 for the same proficiencies.. 5. The 720 does fail big time in the Battery Life department. I previously owned a Tom Tom 300 and once did a round trip from NY to DC (6-8 hrs of driving) on one charge before the unit's battery died. So I expected similar results from the 720 even though the Tom Tom 720's box advertises 4-5 hours.. needless to say, after a full over night charge I only got about 1 hour use before the battery died my first time out with it. After lowering the brightness to 50% I got about 2 hrs max.. I don't like wires across my dash so this was important to me; having the unit work only off its battery for the duration of my round trip commute of 3 to 4 hours max. I soon found out at a few GPS forums that to get about 4 hrs from the 720 you need to lower the brightness to 0% (and even at 0 it is still pretty bright), completely turn off the FM and BlueTooth features, take out any SD Card and turn down the volume and refrain from playing MP3s. Which worked to get me 3 to 4 hrs of battery life but totally elimated all the cool features that made me want to get the 720. At any rate, I went to a local car stereo shop and got a power lead installed behind my dash that goes up thru the windshield area and plugs into the 720 whiles it is mounted on the windshield. This is the best deal since the wire is pretty much hidden and not in front of my dash. I now not only get unlimited battery life whiles driving, but I can have the screen at 100% brightness, Bluetooth, FM and everything else that made me buy the 720 on and working whiles I'm on the road.. When said and done, the Tom Tom 720 is a stellar device!. 

$$;
Pros:. internal memory, bluetooth, fm transmitter. 
Cons:. recalculating lags, TTS voice hard to understand. 
Summary:. The pros outweigh the cons easily, it's a great device! easy to use, fm transmitter works great in the city and in the countryside and the bluetooth is wonderful with the laws in this state making it illegal to talk on your cell without bluetooth.. maps could use a little touching up though... 

$$;
Pros:. great work. 
Cons:. i am really a fan. 
Summary:. we will start with:. 1) Maps: They are accurate i will give 9/10. 2) Gps signal: if you are in a building it takes like 2 minutes after you turn it on to catch the signal. If you are outside then it works simply awesome.. 3) Gps Quick fix: This feature can be worked out only after setting it up with the computer and internet is the must. It loades the position of the satellites for next 7 days and tries to find the signal in that directions when turned on.. 4) FM transmitter: It works great just turn it on and set a frequency in your tom tom and same frquency in your car. I will give it a (/10 because we really need to turn the volume of the car to almost full to hear what it speaks.. 5) Hands free: I read some reviews having trouble setting up the phone on bluetooth, but my blackberry and palm treo were set easily on it.. 6) Maps: you can put the maps of other countries but they charge like $100 gor new-zeland. Some mapshare facilities are free. 7) Voice, Night Map color, Day Map Color are some features that you can download more versions of from net.. In short you will not regreat your decision.. 

$$;
Pros:. simple to use, feature rich. 
Cons:. advanced phone features only work with certain cell phones. 
Summary:. driving performance is great with accurate maps. battery life seems good even with bluetooth and the fm transmitter on. the mp3 player integrates nicely, but i'm shopping for something better than the so-so fm transmitter (but i've never found an fm transmitter that sounds as good as line-in).. the preferences interface is a bit aggravating since there are 8 pages and setting any returns you to the main screen, not the preference page you were on. but once that's setup it i suppose it isn't an issue.. also, text entry is not qwerty (abcdef over 3 rows) so that's a bit annoying.. the hand-free feature is nice, but to get it's full benefit (synchronized phone book, text-to-speech text messages, etc.) you need to use certain phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. Maps are reasonably priced and accurate. 
Cons:. can't load pics for viewing from the SD card. 
Summary:. I recently purchase the Go 920 which is the same as the 720 with remote control added. I had considered other recommended GPS but when I checked the costs of the maps for both upgrades and other countries I was shocked to fine they cost as much as the device itself. Tom Tom has a great selection of maps at a reasonable price. It also comes with Europe installed as well as North America.I have used the device throughout Australia and was very impressed with both the usability and accuracy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Signal Strength, Maps, Rerouting, Bluetooth,, Qwerty keyboard, iPod. 
Cons:. Weak FM transmitter. 
Summary:. This is a a Top performance GPS navigator. Though some have rated it less because of lack of knowledge on how to use or configure a product, i rate it highly.. Has excellent signal strength, rerouting capability. It reduced my miles to work by about 14 miles a day which even mapquest, yahoo, google failed to do. The QWERTY keyboard is great and easy to use. The shortcut feature gets me to the menu feature i want quickly. The Mapshare is a top feature which its competitors dont have. Easy to update the map for an new additions/error correction. Keeps your map upto date. The Bluetooth feature works great with VERIZON Wireless though others say it doesnt (basically need to follow Tom Tom web site instructions to configure). I have a Verizon wireless Motorola Maxx VE and a Nokia. Both worked very smoothly and the hands free feature is superb. The audio quality is great and replaced my bluetooth headset. It has a Help feature which i found very useful to locate a nearby hospital or a police station. The picture viewer and mp3 player is great and can connect to an external headphone / car audio player. The iPod connection feature is great too.. The TOM TOM Home utility is great to configure and backup the device.Its very simple and easy to use with a USB port on your PC unlike some people have stated.. I would have given it a 10 , if it was not for the weak FM transmitter. This too works but in a state like NJ with so many stations its difficult to get a free frequency and a more powerful transmitter would have helped. Many newer cars have the FM antenna at the top rear of their car/suv and this compounds the problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. Too many to list.... 
Cons:. None at all.... 
Summary:. I have had this unit for about three months. I travel all over the US and it has taken me from the east coast to the west coast. I am in San Diego right now and I have not been lost once while going about my daily activities. Awersome unit. Also, used the bluetooth for the first time yesterday. (They said it did not work with Verizon phones) I works really well. Good volume and folks on other end could hear me great. Form factor is really nice. Screen is big and colorful. My friend has the Nuvi 760. ($600 paperweight) The GO 720 does all that his does and a bit more for less money.. GREAT PRODUCT TOM TOM!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic Apart from Cons, Below! Great ergonomics, straightforward menu systems and touch screen control.. 
Cons:. Lack of Assistance with BT Data Functions; Inability to Route Hands-Free Through FM or Audio Cable. 
Summary:. The original review complained about two things, the first of which was evidently an oversight by the reviewer, and the other a point of contention but with a potentially surprising upside for those with a little time to sort things out.. First, the lack of an external volume control: This is managed with a quick swipe along the bottom edge of the touch screen with a finger. Easier than fumbling for a dial or knob. It's as "external" as they get. The default can be set in the system configuration, but immediate changes are always conveniently available at the touch screen in "driving mode".. The second complaint was a paucity of supported BT phone models. This requires both a clarification (many will work with the 720 in hands-free audio mode) and a more detailed explanation (lack of specific support in no way means that the "data mode" features of TomTom Plus aren't supported, although phone book transfers may not work).. The 720 uses Bluetooth for three primary functions: 1) hands-free phone operation, 2) phone book transfers from the handset to the 720, and 3) TomTom plus features that require network connections. The latter set includes such things as weather forecasts, direct download of some features, and perhaps most important -- the use of a BT enabled phone to obtain traffic reports. This last is perhaps the most useful BT feature, and obviates the cost and use of the RDM-TMC receiver and its associated issues.. While TomTom has tested and provides simple Bluetooth data connectivity for only a handful of phones, a prospective buyer should not necessarily feel left out just because his/her phone isn't on the list or their provider or phone included in the list automatically supplied on the 720.. I have successfully connected a most unlikely phone (the Nextel iDen i870 by Motorola) through the Sprint/Nextel system. Why did I think this likely?. Fire up your BT enabled phone and using the BT GUI that came with your Bluetooth dongle for your PC, discover your phone and make an inquiry about what services it supports. If your phone reports that it supports the Bluetooth DUN (Dial-Up Networking) profile, and if you have a data plan with your provider, odds are that there's a way to get this phone to do what needs to be done. The trick is to simply lie to the GO 720 during data connect configuration, supply it with something possibly not even remotely close to your own phone type, and then select "Other" when asked for your provider's name. You'll need to know the login name and password that is used by your provider for using your cell phone as a "Bluetooth modem" for dial up networking services.. As an aside -- you can demonstrate whether this will likely be successful in advance -- set up your PC to connect via "Bluetooth modem" for dial-up networking and insist that this connection (not your internal LAN, DSL or cable modem) be used for a connect to the internet. Having provided the appropriate dial-up networking information to your computer, you should be able to fire up your favorite browser and actually bring up (albeit slowly, in many cases) the internet via your cell phone.. IF what I've just described is possible, then a connection of the GO 720 through your cellphone is just as possible. Supply that same dial-up information to the 720 and it is quite likely that the connection will work, enabling the various TomTom Plus services for you.. Hope that was useful to someone out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. very accurate maps. 
Cons:. none that I can think of.. 
Summary:. Volume control on all TomToms is accessed by tapping the lower left section of the screen. The keyboard can be switched between QWERTY and ABC on the menu. The size of the keyboard is also switchable between small and large.. 

$$;
Pros:. full of features, easy to use and configure, bluetooth, MP3 Played and digital poto frame, SD card for additional storage etc.... 
Cons:. No voice activated commands, no video product. 
Summary:. Definitly worths the money!. 

$$;
Pros:. Does good trip. 
Cons:. Won't pair with my phone. 
Summary:. I can't say this is better than any other GPS since this is the only one I have (except for a mobile one which is not comparable). Even though I can't compare, I really like mine so far. It is really a lot of fun to play with and it has proven to give good directions so far. I don't know how long it will last, or if the technology will become obsolete quickly, or how well TOMTOM will support my product, so, I may revisit my review some day. I am taking a long trip this weekend and this will make driving more fun...i hope.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, very accurate and "Map Correction" is a plus.. 
Cons:. Can't really think of any.. 
Summary:. One of the best GPS units I've used. Directions are clear, and more accurate than other units. Cheaper than the Garmin Nuvi 660 and the TomTom 720 beats the 660 hands down (I went through two Garmin Nuvi's before getting the TomTom). One minor map glitch was easily corrected by the "Map Correction" feature and controls are easy to use. Definitely worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of instant use for basic operation,fm interface worked real good.. 
Cons:. Does not interact with a lot of cell phones,Check their web site for compatible sets. 
Summary:. The C-Net reviewer missed the fact that you can change th volume by touching the bottom left of the screen to change the volume.Great speakers.. 

$$;
Pros:. acquires satellite quickly, FM transmitter, accurate. 
Cons:. bluetooth doesnt work on my phone. 
Summary:. This device has worked perfectly for me ever time I've used it. It's ready to go right out of the box with the latest maps. The device is very accurate and always gets you where you need to go. My favorite feature on this device is the FM transmitter which allows you to play MP3s or audio directions through the car stereo. The 720 acquires a satellite fix quickly and after inputing you destination your on your way in no time. I would definitely suggest this device to a friend.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate maps, Slim Unit, Mapshare. 
Cons:. None for this unit!. 
Summary:. The GO 720 is great! It has a lot of safety features and you can even record driving instructions and it has a lot of POIs. It's really slim and has a great touch screen. I love the 3D view option. MapShare is a great addition. I think it's a great gift for the holidays. 

$$;
Pros:. Great design, innovative ideas, great navigation. 
Cons:. TomTom home freezes Windows, it is not easy to sync and update. 
Summary:. I bought my GO 720 before my New York trip. As a European working in the US I decided to by a Dutch development over the Garmin, however for the first sight, Garmin looked better. I read all the costumer reviews and I felt TomTom having a better customer and on-line support. My first device came defective so I had a chance to try the customer support, that was just perfect so I had no real sour feelings over the defective unit. The exchange unit worked perfect and guided me to NY smoothly, calculating the reroutes fast when I missed a turn. It did not loose GPS signal in downtown NY, not in the Times Square, etc, however I was told my colleagues that GPSs loose signal in NY and in the great cities due to the tall buildings.. I really like the FM transmitter, listening music on my car`s radio, talking on the phone and receive directions meantime.. I believe people (including that one who did the CNET review) had better reading the instruction manual and practice a little before going on a long trip and got irritated. They do not have the knowledge to enjoy the functionalities of the receiver or to write a review at all.. GO 720 is a great gadget for your navigation needs on the road.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast start up, bluetooth sync with your phone and features. 
Cons:. None at all......... 
Summary:. Great GPS, fast start up and full of great features. No problems locating, bluetooth sync is a great hands free option. Works with verizon v3c, no problems retreiving phonebook and making calls. FM transmitter works great with volume on TomTom set @ max.. Text to speech works only with computer voice.... But it's OK. All around great GPS easy to use and navigate through menu.. I did alot of research and ended up with TomTom 720......... 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth works with my samsung SPH-A90,Fast and itelligent interface, Rerouting is instant,Plays my MP3's onto my FM stereo in my car plus pauses when giving instuctions, just all round well built .. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I was looking for a GPS for traveling around Canada and USA, I tried many different units and this one stood out to be far better than than the rest,I compared this tomtom 720 with the garmin 660, it works well has a bit of lag when rerouting and cost more, the others well just took to long to calculate and where difficult to use. I really like the FM transmitter which allows you to broadcast on any vacant FM station, so you have no trouble hearing the voice instruction plus you can listen to all your MP3 while using the map function ,then when I want to use the phone it mutes the music and you can phone via the bluetooth function right from the screen, I was very impressed how well this worked.. theres so much more about this unit that I would be here all day...Anyway would have gave it a 10 out of 10 but that would mean it was perfect and nothing is perfect, but this one comes close.. 

$$;
Pros:. User-Friendly, Comprehensive Features. 
Cons:. Can't think of any. 
Summary:. I highly recommend the GO 720... it was extremely easy to use out of the box and the text-to-speech was very helpful, eliminating the need to look down at the screen. It definitely came in handy, as I am horrible at directions!. 

$$;
Pros:. Maps are really good even in remote areas. Ease of use, Reading the directions are really optional with this unit. The text to speech feature is wonderful. The form factor is excellent. 
Cons:. Bluetooth works, but the mic makes you sound tunneled. The US version doesn't have the speech recognition feature. The 2GB internal memory is really only about 500mb usable space.. 
Summary:. I first tried a friend's GO910 and really enjoyed using it, so I decided to buy a TomTom for myself. After purchasing my GO720 , I took it into the backwoods of the Blueridge Mountain in Virginia and it got side-tracked only once the entire day, but quickly corrected itself within 10 secs. I actually think it performed really well considering the isolated and remote locations that I went into while out photographing the scenery for the day. The 4.3" screen is great. I did download some new map colors for night driving that were easier on the eyes and were free from the TomTom home software. The built in FM transmitter works great and is a nice feature, but the built in bluetooth mic is not that great which is why I only gave the GO720 a 9.0 instead of a perfect score of 10, but I didn't buy this GPS unit for the bluetooth feature totally. TomTom home software is easy to use and I highly recommend using it. The Map correction feature appears to be a good thing also. I do however only let it update the maps that have been verified or acknowledged by many.. 

$$;
Pros:. map shareware. 
Cons:. blue tooth phone applications. 
Summary:. excellent gps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to Use. 
Cons:. Won't let me get lost. 
Summary:. The Go720 is a great device. Their maps are easy to update and very accurate, thanks to TeleAtlas maps and a great GPS interface. The touch screen and the text-to-speech features are pretty cool. TomTom always gets me where I need to go.. 

$$;
Pros:. FM transmitter, best navigation. 
Cons:. Traffic data not as advanced in America. 
Summary:. -You can easily change the keyboard input mode to QWERTY instead of alphabetical (in French I can also choose AZERTY).. -It doesn't have a hard drive but 2GB of internal flash memory (I was very pleased; in very cold temperature my previous GPS took a long time to start because it was hard drive-based. And flash memory is a lot more robust).. -You don't have to "go through several menu levels" to adjust the volume; one tap on the lower-left portion of the screen repeats the last prompt and shows the volume control slider.. -The limited list of supported cell phone is only for the Tomtom Plus services. My phone is not listed (Nokia 6300) but it works well for all the hands-free functions.. -The review missed an innovative and very useful feature; the unit can transmit audio via FM (you can select any frequency). That means that music, indications and incoming calls are heard through the car's stereo, without costly custom installation. Very nice feature because the music is muted when there are indications and during phone calls. The sound quality is then superb (depending on the car's stereo system I guess... But I think that even a very basic one is way better than what any GPS device can offer). 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth Functionality, Wireless Data Communication, Excellent Viewing Screen w/ sensitive TouchScreen, Accurate within Inches. 
Cons:. Short battery life, BT Phone doesn't play through speakers. 
Summary:. Getting ready to move to a big city, I realized that a PND was a must for my Audi. I have always lived by "you get what you pay for" and I figured at $499, I would get a lot. I was right. I am very impressed with even some of the small details such as when the sun starts to go down, the unit senses this and automatically dims and changes to night mode. The maps are accurate and the display is large enough to see. The BT phone connection is great and the speaker is loud enough! The only real complaint I have is that this item can transmit directions and music to the stereo but why can't you transmit the telephone conversation to the stereo as well. The other complaint, there is a lack of battery power, but if you really believe a backlit screen is going to stay on for hours on end without draining the battery, you are not very well versed in electronic theory and the thermal dynamics that can effect battery life ie. cold and hot temps. Easy solution to this is to hardwire your TOMTOM cord into the fuse box with a fuse that doesn't stay on constantly. What makes that really nice is that as you turn off your car and the TOMTOM senses the loss of power, it automatically shuts down. If you have to buy a PND, this is the one to get!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, very user friendly. 
Cons:. There are none. 
Summary:. The Tomtom Go 720 is one of the best units I have installed in my fleet of School buses. Thanks to www.SDcommodities.com with there low prices, I was able to purchase one for every bus I own. Call them at 718-921-9100 for the lowest prices. There customer service is one of the best. They offer a 30 day defective return policy and offer extended warranties at low prices.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very accurate GPS and maps. Allows sharing of map changes with other owners. It is intuitive to set up and use.. 
Cons:. Could use better mounting stand.. 
Summary:. This is a great gps system. Small and portable and easily moved from one vehicle to another. Good reception, even in less populated areas.. 

$$;
Pros:. largest screen available on in-dash models, sd card for extra storage, accurate maps, fast route redirection, slew of features. 
Cons:. FM transmitter is weak and scratchy in areas with highly congested spectrum.. 
Summary:. This is THE best TomTom to date. It gets you where you need to go. The screen is big and readable, plus it is stylish. It mounts/unmounts easily and stays on your windshield.. The reviewer should know that you can change the keyboard to QWERTY in the options.. Bought a 2GB SD card to put some of my favorite tunes on and it plays wonderful with the TomTom, just turned off the voice so it wouldnt interrupt my music ( i can navigate fine without it).. 

$$;
Pros:. Good info on routes, directions and such. POI's interesting but the Help feature lacks laccurate local info.. I was given four Police Stns, hundreds of kilos from our City's Stn???. 
Cons:. Really aggaravated when I updated the unit on my PC and the FM transmission of directions was removed by TomTom.. Don't update if you wish to retain this feature!. 
Summary:. Good unit, great price, large screen, get one while they last!. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate. Good graphics.. 
Cons:. Pain in the butt loading additional POI's. Can only do one at a time and the window refreshs everytime making me start at the beginning again.. 
Summary:. The only big issue I have seen so far is moving through the screens back and forth. Instead of going back to the previous window, it goes back to the main screen. Now I have to go through all the screens again.. 

$$;
Pros:. Mapshare is a plus, technical support is great, system runs very smooth and responds quickly.. 
Cons:. With traffic enabled, voices can get chop. 
Summary:. Xlnt value for the money. 

$$;
Pros:. Very simple/easy windscreen mounting, fast route recalculation, adding maps &#38; customisation using Tom Tom Home (PC &#38; Mac) is very convenient and straightforward.. 
Cons:. Visibility in full sunlight poor, with polarised sunglasses the display is unreadable.. 
Summary:. The only gripe I have with this unit (my 2nd GPS - the first, a Nokia, was a disaster) is the screen visibility in sunlight (maybe this is normal for this type of device). I set both the daylight &#38; night brightness settings to max &#38; deactivated the auto adjust but could not get really satisfactory results.. When the unit is powered on in sunlight, the welcome picture screen is quite bright but the level drops perceptably after a half sec. or so &#38; there is no way I have been able to change this behaviour. Could the ambient brightness sensor be faulty?. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Some menu flaws. 
Summary:. I see A LOT of negative feedback on this device....but everything works fine for me. It has all my local stores....the software is great...you can download new POI. I'm not sure why some people are having these issues but if what "some" of you are saying is happening...i'd be ticked off also. Maybe there was flawed units....updates got corrupt on install...who knows but my 720 is very accurate and I can modify it to my liking. Every 2 days there's a new GPS update in the HOME software that find satellite's faster...my 720 works in my basement...who knows...maybe some area's have poorer satellite reception and that is what is causing these navigation problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. amazing screen, helpful menus, millions of features, picks good routes, rerouting on missed directions is quick, bluetooth hands-free capabilities. 
Cons:. only works on roads [on-foot performance weak], not all roads listed [mapquest also didnt list them], certain restaurants/stores seem to be excluded from the 'poi' database, battery lif. 
Summary:. im not going to lie, this is my first gps, and i dont have much experience with a whole lot of units. but i will say that i have never gotten lost, the unit knows the smartest routes to pick [that locals would choose], and it has a really easy interface to work with. the icons are very large and screen is responsive. the screen also adjusts itself well in the day or night and is readable at all times. in terms of extra features, the bluetooth hands-free feature has come in handy a number of times. however, i rather use cds than use the built-in fm transmitter for music. other than that there are so many options that are available for cuzomization down to the voice that directs you [which you can even record your own]. the two major gripes i have with the unit are that: 1) battery life is good for about 4.5 hours, and maybe less each time you turn it off/on; and 2) i tried to use it in dc to get around town and it seemed to have a rough time telling me where i was when i was on foot. i know its made for the road, but theoretically it shouldve been able to get me around the city.. bottom line: probably the best gps on the market right now when considering features-to-price ratio [this thing always seems to be on sale somewhere, i got mine for $299].. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, fairly accurate, fast, updates are coming online. 
Cons:. Doesnt know my proper street name...whats new?!. 
Summary:. I origionally wanted a Garmin, end of deal, dont try to change my mind, but the guru at Circuit City highly recomended the Tom Tom 720, so for a couple hundred $$ savings I got the Tom Tom. It was easy to use right out of the box, and seemed very accurate.. A few weeks later two other guys at the fire station got a portable Nav. unit also, a magellin and a Garmin. Of course we all three think we have the best one. Not true. Well about two weeks later we set off from AZ. and end up in southern California to help with the wildfires, with our trusy Nav's in hand. Mine worked flawlesly until we got to Riverside, it took us to a recently discontinued intersection and i had to resort to "human" thinking mode and actually look at the unit and the streets, do a quick human re-route and give the driver instructions to get around the block to continue to our destination. we lost 3-5 minutes in our journey...not too bad.. The other crews came in their own trucks and had their own little "we got lost or misdirected" stories also...not too bad for them either.. On a few nights when we had time to go to a Target, Walmart, REI, or a Restaraunt (for some real food), we would all pile in the same truck and set our Nav's up to find the same location and they all did routing a little different from one another and eventually re-routed to get us precicely where we wanted to go, that was like a three ringed circus, but funner...you would have had to been there...lots of directing going on there, we all had it under control.. I also have a 2005 Acura MDX with Nav. and it has its own little quirks too. We seem to forget that these things are machines, and they are only as good as the info that they are programmed with, garbage in = garbage out. Sometimes we have to be smarter than the machine and be able to recognize when it's not guiding us where we want it to then be able to adapt and overcome their limitations even though it gets us all worked up and we are lost or losing time. All in all they are better than no map at all..right?. Tom Tom isnt perfect and neither are the other brands. My coworkers and I all found that out, I think i'll keep mine, I like it and am getting used to it and there are some new online updates for the U.S.A. coming in from Tom Tom so mine'll be bettern theirs. ha ha. 

$$;
Pros:. Instant rerouting. 
Cons:. not as smart as a "local driver" good for unkown areas..

Pros:. Graphics, Versatility, PC connectivity, Available Voices. 
Cons:. No carrying case included, windshield mount, User interface can be tedious. 
Summary:. I bought the Go720 @ Sam's Club for $350. Looked liked the best price on this unit that I could pick up and walk out with. I also have the capability to return with no hassle. I certainly like that because I bought the Magellan 4250 and the Garmin Nuvi 680 from Costco &#38; returned both of those devices. I got the 4250 for $350 and the 680 for $480. Good prices for those units compared to other stores.. I have a review of the 4250 on this site. The BT was atrocious. Everything else was actually pretty nice.. I took the 680 back because it came with MSN Direct and is not available in my area. So what was the point in paying for that?. So far I really like the 720. It has info on the screen that I want that the Nuvi does not, such as, next turn indicator. The Magellan had this also and I think that was important. If I'm on a 4-lane street with a lot of traffic and I need to make a left turn a mile ahead, I want to have enough time to migrate thru the traffic if I'm in the far right lane. The Go720 shows what the next turn is well in advance.. The Magellan 4250 &#38; the Go720 both show POI on the map screen. Not so on the Nuvi. As a matter of fact, you can select what categories of POI you want on the screen. This is nice. The Magellan had the capability to tap the POI on the screen and it would list what they are with addresses, phone number, etc. The GO720 can't do that though.. Bluetooth seems to be a real issue for all GPS devices. After the 4250 fiasco and difficulty getting the Nuvi to work with my BT phone. I had pretty much resigned myself to forget about trying to use BT with a GPS. I have read a lot of reviews on this site and others about the BT issues with Tom Tom. I hit the scan button on my phone and it "found" the 720 immediately. I couldn't believe it. I spent over 2 hours trying to get my phone to connect with the Nuvi and I finally called their customer service line as a last resort and while I was on hold it connected and transferred the phone book even. Anyway, the 720 connected immediately and then transferred phonebook and last calls and recent calls. I have a Motorola E815 phone on Alltel service. Alltel doesn't even come up on anybody's list anywhere that I have seen. SMS texting doesn't work but it didn't work on any of the others either. I made some calls and it works fine. So far so good.. Navigation seems to be on par with the other systems. I plugged in a destination and it calculated a route quickly. I turned off of its route and it quickly calculated a new route with telling me to turn around. So far so good on that.. The 720 has the MM features. One thing it has over the others is the iPod connect feature. Connection kit is sold as an accessory for $30. It allows control of the iPod from the 720. Play thru the 720 speakers or connect from 720 to aux jack on your car stereo. Nice thing about that is that it will mute the music while giving directions.. It has the photo viewer, audiobook and document reader. There is not one mention of the document reader in the PDF manual that came with the CD. I had to go the website and find that it displays HTML documents. Someday I might figure that out.. FM transmitter. Why? I don't get that. I'm either listening to the radio or the iPod. Seems pointless to me.. Scrolling through the menu screens can be tedious and time consuming. I think if you can get used to that, it has a lot more functionality than the other units I tried out for the money. You can even record your own voice for alerts. There is celebrity voices, for a fee, that you can plug in, such as, John Cleese, Mr. T, Curt Shilling.. I think I will be keeping this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast route calculation. 
Cons:. Plus Traffic service not officially available. 
Summary:. There are a couple of problems with the CNET review.. 1) They state that ... "We missed having external volume controls. As is, you have to go through several menu levels to do so, which doesn't make it easy or safe to adjust the audio on the fly." ... WRONG, all you have to do is tap the bottom left of the screen and a volume control slider appears.. 2) The 2G of storage is NOT a hard drive, it is flash memory.. TomTom clearly states that the Plus Traffic service is available in the US. However, when you go to sign up, you are told that it is NOT available for order in the US. I'm still trying to find what's going on.. Overall, the GO 720 is feature rich and quickly calculates the routes for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great routing, MP3 player. 
Cons:. Screen could be alittle brighter during bright sunny days for my taste. 
Summary:. Sometimes when I read C-Net reviews they tend to miss a lot or give wrong information. This is the case with the TomTom Go 720. I am going to correct their mistakes first then I am going to give my review.. 1.)	It would be nice, however, if the keyboard was in QWERTY format instead of alphabetical order for easier text input.. This is not true; the TomTom Go 720 does have a QWERTY option.. 2.)	We missed having external volume controls. As is, you have to go through several menu levels to do so, which doesn't make it easy or safe to adjust the audio on the fly. It is not as hard as they are making it. All you have to do is touch the left bottom of the screen (where the turn arrow is) and the volume slider pops up. Also when you do this it repeats the last spoken directions.. 3.)	The car mount is as simple as you can get. There's only one piece, and it easily slips into a slot on the back of the GO 720. It securely held the unit in place, but we do wish there was an extra locking mechanism for the suction cup like some of the other systems we've seen, just to have that extra reinforcement and peace of mind.. This point is true because mine have fallen off the windshield a couple of times. But I went on e-bay and bought a brand new 3rd party mount that was better and it was cheap too (only $16.98-including shipping)!!!!. 4.)	From a cold start, it took the unit about two minutes to get a GPS fix and subsequent starts took about that long or less.. I have had the GO 720 for about three months now (Sept. 2007) and it NEVER took me two minutes to get a GPS fix. I have always got a GPS fix from a cold start in about 3 to 5 seconds! Thats right 3 to 5 seconds; sometimes I got a fix as soon as I turn the unit on. This is the fastest I have every seen with any GPS.. Like I said I have had this GPS for about three months now (Sept. 2007) and it is not too bad. All GPS have their pluses and minuses. My biggest compliant is that I wish the screen didnt wash-out as much during bright sunny days. You can still read the screen but the slight wash-out is noticeable. I also own a Lowrance iWay 500c (my wifes) and performance is much better with the Go 720 than the iWay 500c. The iWay has a much better and brighter screen. The POIs on the GO 720 are not bad but they can use some work (i.e. missing POIs,) and a sub-category for the POIs would be nice. The routing is the best I have seen in a GPS and the re-routing is SUPER fast! Overall I am very impress with the GO 720. It is a good buy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design and fairly easy to use. 
Cons:. small internal memory (compared to the 910) poor microphone pick up for hands free phone. 
Summary:. Having previousley owned a 910and had lots of problems, I prefer the 720 (built in FM transmitter works well)providing you can find a clear frequency to transmit to. I have rarely lost the signal for more than 1 second on route. But the biggest bug I find with this unit is the microphone pick up when using the hands free phone function. I can hear people fine on the unit and the reception is clear but People I call tell me there is buzzing or hum in the background and my voice fades in and out and is not clear at all. Makes using this part of the unit a waste of time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Directions good, easy to read screen. 
Cons:. Did not seem to reroute fast enough. 
Summary:. I had just bought this GPS a day before my trip to Rochester, I was really happy when I found that it gave the exact route I wanted to take. We then went through Canada to Michigan, the problem arose when I left Rochester, it did not give me the route I wanted to take to get to the Canadian boarder, so I went the way I wanted it kept telling me to make a left. I finally had to turn it off, till I got the the Canadian boarder. Then in gave me the exact route I wanted to take in Canada and Michigan. On the way back it gave me the route I wanted to take. I did not get the voice text working till the last part of the trip,(my internet was down when I got it) sure do like that part of it. This is the second GPS I have gotten, this one is alot better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Routing, Map Share,. 
Cons:. POIs sub-category would have been nice and speaking to you what side of the street your destination was one.. 
Summary:. Lets see where do I start? One year ago I was sold on the Lowrance iWay 500c. This is a good gps with a 5 inch screen. At first I had some problems with it but with the great support from Lowrance I received a replacement unit before my warranty was up. Now the iWay 500c works well. My wife liked the iWay 500c so much that she wanted one for herself. So I decided to purchase another one so we can both have our own. Just before I was about to buy a used Lowrance iWay 500c I came across a review about the TomTom Go 720. The review on the Go 720 was so good that I went to TomToms website and read up on it some more. As you can guess I bought the TomTom Go 720 instead of the Lowrance, and I am glad I did.. The TomTom Go 720 is so much lighter than the iWay thus making it easier to carry around everyday. The features just blew away the Lowrance. I love the fact that you have so many routing options. The maps and POIs are more up to date and the Go 720 looks better too. I am not going to go into all the things that you can do with this baby but let my tell you it is the best gps I have seen for the price. AND THE MAP SHARE CONCEPT IS AMAZING!!! The FM modulator works and sounds great. The routing is good and fast, fast, fast. No slow routing or re-routing here and it speaks the street names well. The only thing that I did not like was that the Go 720 didn't speak what side of street your destination was one, but you can see it on the map. Also POIs sub-category would have been nice. For an example different types of restaurant listings in side the restaurant category like pizza, Italian, ect.. But over all the good out weighs the bad. Do yourself a favor and retire (or sell) your Lorance, Garmin, or any other gps you may own and get yourself a TomTom GO 720. You will be glad that you did. Great job TomTom!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. screen size, keyboard, acquisition time. 
Cons:. SD card install to increase memory is a convuoluted process. 
Summary:. Have now been testing this 720 against a Cadillac CTS factory installed GPS and find:. 1. 720 far easier to use. 2. Maps much more current with free updates vs Cadillac charge of $500.0. 3. screen is just as easy to read as the CTS. 4. Recalculation for route recovery fast and seamless.. 5. Have a major displacement error in the 720 in that my HOME gps indicator has displaced its marker by 1 street and no amount of effort seems to correct. Will seek TomTom tech support.. Bottom line . . why pay $2000 for an in dash unit that is nowhere as efficient as the 500.0 TomTom portable 720. 

$$;
Pros:. Large bright display, can read with sunglasses on, great multi-lane steering feature, custom maps. 
Cons:. So-so battery life, lower-than-expected speaker volume, awful FM transmission, still complex menu operation. 
Summary:. The Go 720, especially at the refurb price of under $170, is a great unit with a few problems. Compared to its predecessor, the TomTom Go 710, this new model is slimmer, wider and has a much brighter screen, so much so that details are easily visible even with polarized sunglasses on. New text-to-speech makes navigating easier by speaking street names, and the user-customized maps keeps your Go 720 more up-to-date without spending over $100 for TomTom's maps.. Bluetooth connectivity is unchanged, but FM transmission to route audio to your car's stereo system is a new addition. Unfortunately, the transmitter is pretty weak, not even extending from the front of your car to an antenna on the rear fender. All I got was static when I tried broadcasting music to an empty space on my radio, even when I held the GPS above the rear seats, so it was useless to broadcast directions through the radio.. Charging through the supplied cradle was relatively quick; not so from the included car charger. And note...if your car, like mine, turns off power to your lighter jack, no charging will take place with the engine off. That's a negative if you aren't planning to drive for two hours and not use the unit, since it appears not to recharge much, if at all, while in use. My unit got only a few hours of use before requiring a recharge; the prior model had a longer battery life. Of course, if you don't mind a cord running to the charger, it works fine while plugged in.. Cranked all the way up, some voices were just not loud enough while driving, and a few others overloaded the sound output enough to distort the speaker and cause the display to flicker in alarm -- the first time I'd ever seen a GPS overloaded by its own audio.. Navigation is generally good, a common feature of TomTom units. Signal acquisition takes from 20 seconds to three minutes or so. While maps are generally accurate, the system sometimes avoids viable side-street shortcuts, and is biased toward using major roads for navigation. On the other hand, it sometimes takes laborous pains to reacquire a route if you stray by a few blocks; you can take quite a detour into residential neighborhoods trying to backtrack where a simple U-turn would be more efficient.. In summing up, if you follow the Go 720 fairly closely, you will get good directions to get to your destinations. It's easy to read, accurate and darned useful. If TomTom fixed the FM and volume issues and made the battery last longer it would be a truly great GPS unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy use for first timer. 
Cons:. Battery does not hold a charge longer than 2 hours. And when using phone you must talk loud to be heard.. 
Summary:. We are very happy with our Tom Tom Go 720 device. We purchased the device for our trip to upper Michigan next month. So far we have used it for short trips under 100 miles and also for finding locations. works well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface, Slick design. Good battery (5hrs). 
Cons:. No route tracking!. 
Summary:. I just bought this thing, and I love it in the car.. What I would love even more would to be able to ride my bike through some trails and then view my journey.. what is that called? Why doesn't this have that? A GPS a friend showed me 5 years ago had that feature. Seems simple enough, and who doesn't want to track their journey on occasion, whether walking or driving?. I'll have to take it back and get something that includes this ridiculously simple feature, cause I want it.. too bad, because otherwise it's a good unit..

Pros:. Fast routing. 
Cons:. Screen washes out in bright sun light. 
Summary:. I just got the Garmin Nuvi 5000. My wife owns the TomTom Go 720, and I have owned the Lowrance iWay 500c in the past. Read the following review I gave for the Garmin Nuvi 5000 and the TomTom Go 720 below:. I needed a new GPS after my Lowrance iWay 500c just died on me (it was a gift so I am not crying about the lost that much). Let me tell you DO NOT BUY an iWay 500c. It is a piece of crap! In July, 2007 I bought the TomTom Go 720 for my wife. I wanted a GPS for myself and after having my Lowrance iWay 500c stop working on me I did some shopping for another GPS. I came across the Garmin Nuvi 5000. Wow, this unit has a huge 5.2 inch screen but is so light and thin. If you like Garmin products but want a bigger screen then this is it. It has the latest maps, POIs, and features already install and ready to go! The routes (directions) are perfect every time unlike the iWay 500c. Go to www.garmin.com and read up on this bad boy. It is worth ever dime that it is selling for. All GPSs have their pros and cons. NONE OF THEM ARE PERFECT. What I like and dislike about the Garmin Nuvi 5000 and the TomTom Go 720 are the following:. Likes (Garmin Nuvi 5000):. 1.)	Nice, bright, big screen. 2.)	Directions are accurate. 3.)	Speaks the street names often and clearly. 4.)	Great POIs database (maybe the best I have seen in a GPS). 5.)	MSN DIRECT-Excellent!!!! (Traffic, Move Times, Weather, Local Events, Gas Prices, News, and Stocks-WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). 6.)	Great looking maps. I think people are jealous when they ride by me and see my GPS or may be they want to steal it-I dont know. 7.)	GPS is very light and non-bulky for its size.. Dislikes (Garmin Nuvi 5000):. 1.)	Routing and re-routing calculations are not as fast as the TomTom Go 720. It needs to be a little faster for my taste, because it can be a little bit slow.. Likes (TomTom Go 720):. 1.)	FAST routing and re-routing (the fastest I have ever seen in a GPS).. 2.)	Very easy to pick alternate routs.. 3.)	Good to some what great directions, but sometimes screwy.. 4.)	Mapshare. Dislikes (TomTom Go 720):. 1.)	TERRBLE mount!!! I had to buy a 3rd-party mount because the one that it came with it didnt hold the GPS well. The GPS kept falling off the windshield.. 2.)	The screen washes out to much in bright sunlight.. 3.)	Though the GO 720 speaks the street names, but it doesnt speak them as often or clearly as the Garmin Nuvi 5000.. 4.)	The screen could be bigger for my taste.. 5.)	Traffic capability is expensive and the coverage is not as big as the MSN Direct with Garmin.. 6.)	No Move Times, Weather, Local Events, Gas Prices, News, and Stocks features like the Garmin Nuvi 5000 with MSN Direct.. So you make your choice, but what ever you do DONT BUY THE LOWRANCE IWAY 500C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

Pros:. Relaible device.. 
Cons:. Sound quality. 
Summary:. PETER TEIMAN FRANKLIN here,. A much-improved Tom Tom product which can well compete with the other top brands.. PETER TEIMAN FRANKLIN,. Sweden. 

$$;
Pros:. speakerphone, quick recalc. 
Cons:. to many taps to get to things. 
Summary:. i just wanted to add taht you can use the speakerphone function if you have verizon wireless; i think it depends on the phone. i have the juke and had no problem connecting to the speaker phone function. teh other tomtom extras aren't available (traffic etc) but i will live without them. so far it works well. although i have only tested it with routes i am familiar with, the directions it gives are not too far off course. and when i vear off track, it recalculates quickly. i only give a 8 because i have yet to try it to get somewhere i am not familiiar with...... 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy user interface, smooth graphics, good touch screen. 
Cons:. Satelite detection in the middle of sky-scrapers, no walking mode directions, POI list out of date. 
Summary:. I decided to buy this GPS as a gift for my whife, especialy because of the great user interface(UI). Is true that the UI is very friendly and the graphics are very smooth, the touch screen has no nonsense, with good visibility, with the exception of direct light (direct light would fade any LCD in the world anyway). Out of box it found the signal in 30 seconds, but my home address showed on the other side of the street, otherwise the map was fairly correct. Drive testing for the last 4 month found that rerouting is super fast, has accurate maps in big city areas like Seattle WA, Rochester MN, Philadelphia, PA, but very inaccurate maps in small cities like Roanoke, VA. The trip in Minessota revealed that when turned on in a 60mph moving car, could not detect the satelite for 20 minutes. Since it was opened space, I suspect that it locked somehow, and must be a software bug.. The trip to Philli revealed that between skyscrapers did not detect the satelite, unless I was on a large boulevard, so it could get some opening. Also, when I decided to use it for walking arround, I found out that it was like a dumb device, and could not realize that my speed was far from a car speed, and kept giving me routes like for cars, meaning one way streets, which made me walk in circles. When I decided to find two museums, from the local POI list, in both cases I found nothing at the destination point. As for hotels and dinner places, this GPS has no issue, the POI list looks to be accurate in this area. Overall, is very easy to use, the POI list might be a gamble, and the detection in other than open spaces and standing still looks to be difficult. So if you live out of downtown, this unit would do the job. Connection with GSM phone was easy (razr with T-Mobile), but I didn't sign up for the traffic services (at 500$, this should be included for the first year). Bottom line, whife likes it, and can use it without asking me what do do.. I wish that they would replace some fancy software I don't use, like MP3 player thing, and put more effort into functional needs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large touch-screen, features/versatility, speed, portability. 
Cons:. Some map accuracy issues, menu navigation. 
Summary:. I purchased mine before reading the CNET review in order to take on 3-wk trip through southwest nat'l parks, based mostly on the opinion of a colleague and some limited online research I'd done.. I think the CNET reviewer (Bonnie Cha) did a good job of summarizing. Two corrections: 1) the volume control is easily available by tapping the lower-left side of the screen (at least it is on my unit), and 2) the keyboard can be arranged alpha, qwerty, or one other option I don't remember.. Also--contrary to several other reviewers--I had no problems getting my Motorola Q (Verizon) to work with this device, despite not being listed as compatible. I didn't have time to sign up/try the Traffic Service, but probably will now that I'm back home in urban area.. I spent a few hours at the computer the evening after I purchased it (and before I flew west the next morning) to make sure the latest maps and sw/fw were downloaded. I also found out about itineraries, and tried to pre-load all my destinations. This would be where I ran into the first snags: I couldn't locate several of the places where I was staying until I used Google Earth to get lat/long. The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is certainly less traveled than the South Rim, but it seems strange that I couldn't find it, or a couple of other park locations in the search. Now that they're in there, I'll have to try MapShare so that others can navigate more easily.. During my trip, there were several times where the GO720 insisted I was driving off road, when I was most definitely on terra firma and the macadam. To be fair, this happened most often while on relatively remote fire roads.. There were also several times where "Susan" (we nicknamed it Susan after the computer voice) suggested we turn onto a road that wasn't there. And I don't mean missed it by 50 ft--I mean there was absolutely no road. This happened more than a couple of times traveling through Utah, Nevada, and western California.. Trying to navigate the menus while driving took some getting used to, and I wouldn't say everything's arranged optimally. But I did become relatively adept at plotting or editing routes, or even making minor adjustments. All that said, the touch screen worked extremely well, and the size (both of the screen itself and the fonts) was very well proportioned.. I especially liked the route recalc when you (intentionally or not) miss a turn--it's very fast. The voice prompts were clear and generally well-timed, and street name pronunciation was acceptable (if occasionally a source of amusement).. Overall I'm happy with this purchase. And the fact that my parents used it on their recent trip (after driving around with "Susan" and me for a few days) speaks to the excellent ease-of-use.. I've experienced no hardware problems at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well. Fits well in the car. Phone support has been very good.. 
Cons:. NO Manual for the 720. I can't believe this. It has been weeks since it has been available for purchase in the US and still no manual that you can download. Please Tom Tom tell us why?. 
Summary:. Very good product. Would have rated it higher but with no manual after this time, I find this inexcusable.. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS interface, FM Tuner, iPod intergration. 
Cons:. TomTom Home, Mac support, only BT DUN support, poor documentation. 
Summary:. I got this machine recently after a lot of research. I have used the Go 900 and I really liked it. TomTom have always made some of the best units in the market and the 720 is excellent to use. I had to use an older cell phone to get the Plus service to work, after some trial and error and a call to customer support I got it working. Map sharing and correction is great, I have already used it a couple of times.. The real problem is that you have to use the TomTom Home to manage your device. This is really buggy on a PC though they have just upgrades it to 2.0 version. On the Mac it is appalling. I am hoping that there will be a new Mac version soon.. All in all a great GPS unit let down by some poor software backup..

Summary:. I am coming from a Garmin world. I had problems with the Garmin routing me weirdly, and occassionally placing me 1000 feet or so from where I was was.. The 720 is very full featured. It also routes me weirdly at times although not as weird as the Garmin unit did. It gives directions differently as well and I find it better than Garmin in that respect.. But it has serious flaws too:. 1. The screen washes out in bright sunlight much more than the Garmin did.. 2. It connected easily to my Blackberry for voice but the quality is so bad it is unuseable.. 3. It won't connect to my Blackberry for data so traffic updates and such do not work. I have tried a dozen manual and automatic settings with no luck.. 4. Favorites and POIs. When you add a favorite or POI, you can not see or pull up the actual address. So adding the name of a restaurant for instance as "My Restaurant" makes you lose the address. You can navigate there but even reviewing the details of the route only show street name, no house number. I have taken to adding any favorite or POI as something like "100 Main St, Anytown, NY - My Restaurant". It works but it is messy looking. If you name a favorite with the nickname first, it actually displays "100 My Restaurant - Main St, Anytown, NY" This is something that tempts me to return the unit.. Map quality seems to be similar to Garmin and well. Both have errors. Garmin's screen animation is jerky whereas Tomom's is smoother but the Garmin screen resolution is better and the road you are supposed to travel on is better marked.. Best thing to do is try them both if you can. Neither is perfect by a long shot.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear directions, made one mistake (local driving in downtown Toronto) during my trip to Toronto from NYC.. 
Cons:. TomTom needs to add new phones that are compartible to this device. I have AT&#38;T wireless and I am having a very hard time finding a phone that works with this system.. 
Summary:. This baby was great. It never lost connection and I did not have it connected to the charger for the majority of my trip to Toronto from NYC. My only disappointment was not knowing how difficult it would be to get a phone that will enable me to use the handsfree and the traffic update.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth capable, wireless mp3 playable but completely unlistenable because of signal degradation.. 
Cons:. Read review for complete cons.. 
Summary:. After owning the TT 720 for over a year my buying recommendation is a resounding no. If you are buying it for the added features like map share upgrades you will be disappointed. I have yet to receive one loop, lane, court or street upgrade from this function even though I have downloaded upgrade to my unit many times. Map share does not add one iota upgrade of anything. If you have decided to buy any of TT?s unit for the RDS-TMC feature be advised it?s going to cost you $60.00 yearly to subscribe for this service, but before you can use the service you must purchase the antenna plug receiver for over $130. I?ll sell you mine for only $90. The navigation part of the unit itself is questionable, I?ll have to give it a B+. The unit redirects your route if you miss it, but remember it?s an electronic device that?s as good as its programmers. I?ve had instances where I?ve missed a turn, and instead of redirecting to make a u-turn when possible it took me around the block of neighborhoods, other times more times than I care to remember the unit because of the lapse in receiving the satellite signal told me to make a turn when it should not. If you are buying it for its mp3 capabilities please be advised that if you use it wirelessly the signal is very poor and most of the time the signal is in and out making listening to music this way completely insane.. My recommendation to you is to get a unit that was manufactured within the past 6 -9 month and pay as little as possible and discard it and buy a new one when you need to..

$$;
Pros:. Navigation. FM Transmitter for Music and Instructions.. Easy to access map data as well as free update of maps when purchased.. 
Cons:. Hands free not possible through FM Transmitter (Calls do not come through on the FM Transmitter). 
Summary:. How to get your TomTom Go720 to read instructions through the Car audio system/radio. Go to - "Change Preferences" -&gt; "Speaker Preferences" you will then be asked how you would like the TomTom to read instructions. Select "FM to your car radio" should you require it to read instructions while playing music. Its rather annoying that this is not possible with calls, as I find it extremely difficult to hear anything through the built-in speaker (not much better than Loudspeaker on my phone).. The main objective of this review was to provide users with access to instructions via FM Transmitter as requested by dssbigboy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Decent feature set; map share; POI database. 
Cons:. Travel time estimation WAY off; Buggy. 
Summary:. I received the TomTom 720 for Christmas this year. Out of the box, I liked the device and it seemed very intuitive. However, my first road trip was a 340 mile drive to Lake of the Woods, one I make several times a year. I was anxious to see what route it would recommend and how else it would work. The route selection can be subjective, and it did not select the route I always take. I blame this partly on the fact that TomTom's database does not apparently include actual speed limits on roadways. So it assumes certain roadways are 30 mph. Therefore, it was almost doubling the travel time for my trip and picking longer routes to stay on the major highways. Not a big deal, you can modify the route to go through certain towns or use certain roadways. Where this REALLY frustrated me was when I was in Fort Meyers recently and tried to plot a route from the airport to Sanibel Island. The device just froze, and then rebooted. Once it started up again, it would automatically try to recalculate the route and then reboot. I had to clear the route to stop this from happening. Same thing happened when I tried to go BACK to the airport. Not sure what was going on.. I have had generally good success with this device when plotting shorter trips to offices I have not been to before, a Target in Fort Meyers (which was in the POI database and I found by looking for POI's near me, very helpful), etc. The on screen display has good, useful data (when accurate) and it is intuitive.. I would like to try a Garmin or other brand to see if the travel time estimates are better and the overall route selection is better, but overall I am satisfied with the device.. 

$$;
Pros:. EASE OF INSTALLATION,UPDATING ,NICE SCREEN. 
Cons:. SHOULD HAVE EXTERNAL VOLUME ADJ, CANT FIND EXTRA CAR MOUNT ANYWHERE. 
Summary:. I LIKE GO 720,WORKS VERY WELL...NEED TO HAVE BETTER ACCESSORIE AVAILABILITY.... 

$$;
Pros:. excellent form factor, simple user interface, ipod support,. 
Cons:. poor routing logic, limited cell phone support, lame desktop software, mapshare too hard to configure and save routes while in transit, crippled access to traffic reports. 
Summary:. I bought the TomTom 720 to help me with my part time delivery job. It had several excellent features and I loved the form factor but at the end of the day it didn't work well enough for me to keep it.. I was surprised to find that the TomTom 720 had difficulty with simple routes that I used everyday. For example, in the Best Buy were I bought it, the 720 was the only floor model of the same trim level that could not locate my office (which is off of a major road only 3 blocks away). The Magellan 4040 and the Garmin Nuvi 660 both found the address and plotted a route right away.. The feature set on the TomTom 720 is very generous for a $499 gps unit. Unfortunately many of those features did not work for me. The mapshare feature was hard for me to configure especially considering that I was doing deliveries and did not have time to stop and correct inaccurate routes on the GPS or make notes about which streets were closed due to construction.. I also had difficulty with the desktop software which is where you upload map corrections for Mapshare. I tried to use the desktop software to update the maps on my new unit and download some new voices but alas I could not. The purchase features were set up for european clientele only, there were no prices stated in us currency.. To add insult to injury, it had bluetooth support for handsfree calling but only for gsm phone carriers on a very limited number of handsets. There wass no love for Verizon or Sprint customers here in the U.S. (which I assue is because they are based in europe where GSM is the universal standard for wireless phones).. Believe it or not, all complaining aside I really wanted the 720 to work well for me. I prefer their user interface over the other two big GPS competitors (Garmin and Magellan). Unfortunately the TomTom 720 did not come through for me where it counted the most - when I was on the job and on a very limited time frame. As a matter of fact it did the opposite of what it was supposed to do it...it got me lost because it could not warn me of a closed road through live traffic updates. I ended up spending 2 hours lost on the back side of the desert trying to find my way home using dirt trails and dusty poorly marked back roads. I took it back the next day.. In summary this is nice unit with plenty of nice features but it is far from perfect and not the best unit for delivery drivers. I would reccomend the Garmin Nuvi 660/680 or the Garmin streetpilot C580 for that type of usage instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great extra features, Looks great, Beautiful screen/resolution. 
Cons:. GPS accuracy was no good. 
Summary:. The TomTom Go 720 has tons of great features like: FM Transmitter (great idea), MP3 player, photo viewer, etc. All of those things though, can't make up for the fact that the actual GPS function is sub-par. It was not accurate at all, and chose foolish routes to easy-to-find locations. Also, when missing a turn, it was not terrible at making new calculations, but it took a little longer than I would have liked (enough time to miss the new turn it has instructed you to take).. I also found that the menus were quite convoluted, it took a long time to get through all the menus and submenus to get what you were looking for. This is however, mostly due to the fact that it has a lot of extra features, so with that you have to take the good with the bad.. Overall, I decided to return this GPS. TomTom just isn't the quality that the brand name would have you believe. I'll most likely stick with a Gamin, which in my experience has been super-accurate as far as GPS goes, even if there are fewer functions. GPS is the main thing, after all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great graphics and very accurate. 
Cons:. Bad suction cup design. 
Summary:. Although this GPS has great graphics and accuracy it has one major flaw; that is it is too heavy for the suction cup that is supposed to hold it on sturdily on the windshield. I tried finagling in different ways to get to to stay on but time after time it eventually pointed downward. This may be overcome by the optional "alternative mount kit" or "adhesive discs". Nontheless, a very annoying design flaw.. 

$$;
Pros:. large screen relatively in expensive(for the features available), easy to use. 
Cons:. horrible graphics, bluetooth doesnt connect to my pda phone, can play songs from sd card(or at least i dont didnt know how), street names no clear enough sometimes, long routes,. 
Summary:. i bought this gps from sams club for 300 8/14/08 because im going to florida for a job and i need a gps to help me get there. first of all on local directions going to my house for example tomtoms route would have added 25-30mins to a route that normally takes 12mins. was unable to connect bluetooth to my phone. NO TECHNICAL SUPPORT NUMBER IN AMERICA. wouldnt recommend. 

$$;
Pros:. Great feature set for the price.. 
Cons:. Screen fade in sun and bluetooth phone support.. 
Summary:. I wanted to like this unit as it had many features I wanted. I was also interested in the map sharing feature. I returned the 720 as the screen faded too much in the sun even when set at max brightness. The 720 claims Bluetooth support, but I guess my phone was not on the list. I always thought Bluetooth was Bluetooth, but I guess not.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works as advertised, enjoy using it. 
Cons:. Cannot get onto the Tomtom.com web site to download upgrades, maps, etc. Neither Verizon or Tomtom is able to correct this at this time. Many others also have this problem at this time.. 
Summary:. Terrific system except for problem in connecting to Tomtom.com. Part of the appeal of buying Tomtom is the ability to upgrade maps, etc. right from Tomtom web site but it won't work. I am not the only Tomtom owner impacted by this, there are many at this time. BE AWARE!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Visibility Day and Night , Routing.. 
Cons:. It is not MS outlook compatible.. 
Summary:. I will not buy anything that is not MS outlook compatible. I have 600+ Phone numbers and addresses in MS outlook. I am not re-entering these. My blue tooth Samsung SGH A707 did connect and I could transfer phone numbers to GO 720 but only the top # in the business card file. Many business contacts have multiple phone #s. I am taking it back. I am going to try the iPAQ 310. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of really excellent features. 
Cons:. Most of them do not work. 
Summary:. Where to begin with this one? I purchased the TomTom 720 For a production trip in Philly just last week. I was in a Best Buy, I didn't know the area and thought, "this will do everything and more!". Well it was more like something and some.. 1) GPS - For the most part? Accurate. And quick to readjust when you pass a turn. My biggest complaint? When I asked for North 2nd street in Philly and it suggested I was looking for EAST second street. I got to the wrong locale - TEN MILES AWAY - and when I arrived it all of a sudden COULD find a north 2nd street. Not fun.. 2) Bluetooth - It worked just fine for voice calling with a cellphone. The fun part? Customer service said my blackberry pearl WOULDN'T work. But it did. And it paired my address book too. But then came the bluetooth for real time traffic updates. That didn't work. Customer service (who ofter took upwards of 30 minutes to "look something up") said the problem was my phone which wasn't set up for such things (an anti-bluejacking RIM feature) but then was unable to provide me any T-mobile phones that WOULD work. I'm not saying that they won't. I'm saying TOMTOM customer service doesn't know about it.. 3) Memory Chip - Oh this was a ball. Customer Service gave me conflicting advice here several times on how to put music on my SD card so it would work through the device. After the fifth call a rep told me that my 4 gig card just wouldn't work. And probably a 2 gig wouldn't either. Though she couldn't say for sure.. 4) Music player - It works fine with the songs that store on the internal memory (which if you clear space off the unit by deleting maps of Guam, gets you to 500 Mb). It also plays through the radio via a fairly strong built in FM transmitter. Which is also the way it transmits the instructions. And it pauses the music to do so. At one point the music said "Turn around Bright Eyes" and it paused for the nav voice to say "turn around 500 feet". That was kinda awesome.. 5) Manual - There isn't one. They shipped without it. I thought it was a mistake. I went to the website. They direct you to a PDF that's one page and tells you to call their 877 number. And when you do they say there's no manual. Which you'd think would suck, but there's nowhere in the enclosed materials that references a local TOMTOM phone number until that point. So you're actually pretty pleased not to be calling Britain long distance.. 6) SERVERS - Again, one of those things you think wouldn't matter. It does. The update feature for TomTom at home requires you to be logged into their main servers. Unfortunately they don't have enough of them right now. So you will wait for an hour, sometimes three, just to log in. Provided you don't get the "session expired" message in the meantime.. 7) Software - Oh this was joyful. I got a message, after waiting to log on, that said, "would you like to download the latest version of tomtom at home?" I did. And after that it didn't work anymore. I called customer service. They said THAT version shouldn't be on the site because it doesn't work. I asked why they put it up there. They said that I was the one who downloaded it and I didn't have to do that. So yes, they blamed the downloadee. For believing them when they said I might need to update.. 8) Menus - There are DOZENS of them. And they are not intuitive. It took me an hour to figure out how to see where I was without entering a route. I ended up calling customer service (I was up to call 17 in four days at this point) and they pointed me to a menu that seemed like it would wipe the system. Turns out it didn't.. OVERALL: This could have been a great GPS. It gets a lot of things right. All they needed to do was wait a year, fix the bugs, train their techs on how to actually use it and enclose a FRIGGIN MANUAL FOR IT. Instead they sold first and hid later. IN a year this will be a great receiever with lots of working features and great people behind it. Right now? It needs one more addition to make it something you'll take with you - a giant bottle of ADVIL for the headaches.. 

$$;
Pros:. MP3, Style, audio out, screen quality. 
Cons:. Bluetooth volume, FM transmitter. 
Summary:. I'm returning my third unit today. First unit's battery only would last 2 hours and had screen issues. The second unit's 3.5 unit's audio jack came apart the first time I inserted it. This is an excellent feature since you can play the MP3's throught your radio. The third only had Guam maps installed? I am quit frustrated at the times I had to return it but when the unit worked...it was nice. The Bluetooth volume was awful while driving...not loud enough. I have a '06 Toyota Rav4 V6 and it's really not that loud in the cabin, I believe there should be a fix on this. The FM transmitter was alright but I had to spend some good quality time attempting to locate a good station that wouldn't buzz. Will attempt the TOMTOM 920 that should be coming out soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, nice voices, FM transmitter. 
Cons:. Complex menu, handsfree horrible, poor visibility in sun. 
Summary:. I really wanted to like this device as my first GPS purchase. At first I found the directions and large screen size to be a big plus and the form factor, while not as small as some, was decent enough for my tastes. It even synced up with my Mac almost flawlessly, which is impressive when most devices these days don't have Mac support.. My first complaint came when I got deeper into the menu and preferences system. There is only one way to describe it, poorly organized and overly complex. It's hard enough to find options while sitting at my desk, forget about doing it while driving. Even trying to navigate the music player while driving is difficult and dangerous. Hands free calling is almost as bad. In addition hands free calls are useless unless your car is silent. Low speaker volume and poor microphone reception don't make for a fun experience. And in addition to that it froze my Sony-Ericsson phone twice, I had to pull the battery to get it to reset, a first for me!!!. When you are paying $500 for a device that has all the bells and whistles I expect those bells and whistles to actually work for me. General GPS navigation seemed fine to me, no complaints there, but the bugs with the other features completely turned me off of this device and TomTom. I returned this unit and will be trying a Garmin next.. 

$$;
Pros:. Hard to argue with the editors.... 
Cons:. Two issues; 1- Mapping 2- Hidden cost. 
Summary:. Two issues; 1- Mapping is not always accurate. At a local intersection, system has me make right turn, go 1/4 mile and then make a u turn to go the correct direction. (This is a major intersection in our area) 2- More importantly, the map updating service is very costly in my view. Recently received one of their emails to take advantage of a yealy update feature. Once I bit the bullet &#38; decided pay for this feature, they tried to tack on an additional cost ($31.95) to update my "system" and then I could take advantage of their sale for 6 updates for an $39.95. Some sale. Trashing this unit &#38; going w/ a reputable company.. 

$$;
Pros:. 4.3" screen. Device feels and looks very sturdy and professional. Easy to maneuver through software. Amazing user-ability of POIs.. 
Cons:. TOMTOM GPS navigation is not as accurate as Garmin GPS. Maps do not look sharp as Garmin/ Sony. Map colors do not display government (Military bases, national parks or zoo's). Check out San Diego Balboa District. No names colors displayed on map.. 
Summary:. 1) On my first trip from Virginia Beach to Yorktown, VA the TOMTOM GO 720 GPS device was not able to accurately get me to my destination. I was lost for over 1 hour. On my second trip from Virginia Beach, VA to Camp Lejeune, NC (Jacksonville), the TOM TOM device asked me three times to turn in areas that did not get me to the base. Finally, I turned it off and ask how to get to the Main Gate at Cam Lejeune. The destination address was accurate, the GPS device was not!. 2) I called TOM TOM 8 times in one week. Finally, I was able to speak to a supervisor. The problem is as follows: Outside of major cities, TOM TOM GPS mapping system lacks accuracy. I concur since it consistently missed my final destination by 500 to 1000 feet. That is UNACCEPTABLE.. 3) TOM TOM support staff is aware that their maps are not good for smaller city routes. For instance, if you live in Orlando FL you are in luck. TOMTOM company pays attention to areas that Europeans often visit such as, Florida, NY City and the large cities of California. If your city is not a tourist destination, BEWARE, that your TOM TOM may be INACCURATE.. 4) Suddenly turning off! This plagues Garmin too.. 5) TOM TOM has systemic problems with their voices after upgrading to the 8.3 firmware!. Updated. on Dec 28, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen, large icons, large screenboard. I've found a fair price during Black Friday (250.oo).. 
Cons:. I travel along with Neverlost from Hertz, enroute from Des Moines, IA to Kimberly,WI the Magellan told me the exact route of 400 miles, the TomTom showed an extra 65 miles!!! selecting Shortest Time. With Shortest distance it was even worst.. 
Summary:. Even the interface is clear (sometimes is dificult to point things with the gloves on!!), the main feature of a GPS, i.e. giving you the exact route is not assured with this device. Hope I can buy the Hertz stuff!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, easy to view in car (with third party mount), works well as portable.. 
Cons:. 5 weeks after I bought the unit TomTom wanted another $80 to $130 to upgrade the maps - I refused. As time passes it is less able to find destinations, sending me in circles. Next time I will do a better job researching the map maintenance policies.. 
Summary:. No complaints about the functionality but the cost of maintaining the maps and the lack of support for a newly purchased device makes me wish I bought another brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ipod Interface. 
Cons:. Bluetooth connections. 
Summary:. The TomTom GO 720 feature list is significant and appealing, however anyone considering buying based on any of them should test the feature and the TomToms compatibility beforehand.. TT GO 720 Speaker Preferences includes the the option to select Bluetooth. However it wouldn't work with my Callpod Dragon and when I questioned TomTom about the problem they responded that the TT GO 720 was not designed to connect to any Bluetooth design except a phone...WHAT? Then why include Bluetooth as an external speaker option?. At this time, we do need to inform you that our units are not designed to connect to any other device other than a cell phone. We apologize for any frustration that this may cause. Expanding our programming to meet the needs of our customers is very important to us. We frequently use customer feedback as an initiative to add or improve our navigational and usage features. Any programming requests made regarding our equipment or software will be forwarded to our product development team for review.. My AT &#38; T HTC 8525 phone also did not interface completely with the TomTom GO 720. The data interface would not enable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth works great.. Recalculates routes very guickly. Nice slim design. 
Cons:. Cannot accurately find/locate my address! Also unable to locate other addresses. Not I repeat not very user friendly. 
Summary:. I was given a Megellan 4000 for christmas but it did not have Bluetooth capaibilities. So I purchased the tom tom because of the price and that it seemed to offer so much more? What a mistake that was! Well, I am very dissapointed with the tom tom! It cannot find my HOME ADDRESS correctly! It tells me I live 100 yards from my actual location! It also was unable to find a friends doctors office. However, when I looked for it on the Megellan, it found it no problem! The Megellan also had no problem correctly finding my home location CORRRECTLY! The Megellan is not as fast as the Tom tom but shows the maps better and it has the ability to correctly find my home and other addresses, isn't that the purpose? I should have listen to those reviews that complaint about the same thing. But there were also so many good reviews I thought the negative ones might be isolated? Well, they are not! Also, the tomtom's mount is a joke! very cheap and not very secure? I say that because it has not way to ensure suction other than just pressing against the windshield. The megellan again had a SUPERIOR mount and also came with a pouch for storing. The tom tom had no pouch, you have to purchase it separately! Even the display was better on the Megellan! Bottom line. I would keep the megellan if it had Bluetooth? So I am returning not only the Megellan, but definetly the tom tom! My advice, DO NOT PURCHASE THE TOMTOM! go look at the other GPSs. I know that the megellan is a good GPS but I have heard great things about the Garmin. So for me the quest for a good/accurate GPS continues. But do yourself a favor and DON'T BUY THIS MODEL!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Does what its supposed to do. 
Cons:. You can not buy any accessories. 
Summary:. I have had my TomTom Go 720 for over 1 month now and I am still not able to buy a carrying case for it. I am concerned that any other support I might need from TomTom may be as unavailable as any accessory I would like.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty interface. 
Cons:. Inaccurate, confusing. 
Summary:. Got it for Christmas as a gift. Been playing with it for 2 weeks. Impossible. Computerized voice can't even say numbers in the 30s...they come out as 40's. Sometimes it tells you to turn early, sometimes not. My house has been here for 13 years, and it doesn't know my address in a major city. Took it back and got the Garmin Nuvi 660 -- fantastic!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good GPS, don't buy this for the MP3 or the Bluetooth. 
Cons:. Poor MP3 player, Poor Bluetooth, Poor software. 
Summary:. Originally I purchased this with the ratings from Cnet reviews..... C'mon guys.... can you please do a complete evaluation of your reviews... Please !!! I bought this unit over others (Garmin) because of some of the features especially the MP3 player, Bluetooth.. First of all the Bluetooth feature will not work on most phones especially if you have verizon, I tried pairing this with 3 different phones, the phones actually recognize the TomTom but the problem is the TomTom will not pair with any of my phones.. 2nd the MP3 player function is a Joke... I got more static coming out of my car speaker then the music, I tried every empty station out there... and add insult to injury the customer service is so slow... it took over 1hour to reach anyone and when I finally spoke with tech. support he refer me to there website for further answers...... Goodbye TomTom.... I am returning this unit... any getting a no frills Garmin. 

$$;
Pros:. seems intuitive. 
Cons:. doesn't say street names, as it says it does. 
Summary:. we got this for my parents, because it looked easy to use and would say the names of the street (we have an older Garmin that doesn't say the names, and know the advantage of the feature).. We downloaded the update from tomtom.com, ran a demo route, but it didn't say the street names. We then took it for a test drive and it once again would not say street names.. I have tried repeatedly to get TomTom on the phone today, but the line has been busy all day.. Right now, I am a very unhappy camper.. 

$$;
Pros:. good navigation. 
Cons:. poor access to SD card, bluetooth limitation, mount. 
Summary:. I decided to buy this instead of the nuvi660 because of the amount of information always displayed on the screen - although I wish it had the trip information including averages that the nuvi displays. Navigation is quick and excellent and recalculates routes quickly if you make a detour.. BUT I bought this because of the added features of FM, MP3 player and bluetooth as well and each of these has serious limitations.. Accessing the mp3 files on the SD card is difficult to say the least - there is NO documentation from TomTom and there are websites devoted to making the SD card work - you can't just put mp3 files or photos on a card and stick it in, as I would have expected.. The FM radio works ok but seems a bit weak with a bit of static even with my 720 in the middle of the windscreen. BUT the FM radio will transmit navigation directions and mp3s BUT NOT BLUETOOTH! What the f---!. Bluetooth connected with my phone ok and I successfully made and received calls but the other end reported a lot of noise. BUT the bluetooth connection would not accept being used as a speaker for the phone SO I could NOT play music from the phone through the 720 and I could get NOTHING from the phone through to the FM transmitter in the TOMTOM. I expected that all music and phone conversations from the 720 would be transmited through the FM transmitter to the car speakers as well as the directions and music files from the TomTom. Had I known the 720 had these limitations I would have bought the nuvi 660.. P.s. why can't the 720 or nuvi display elevation anywhere. This is a fairly standard GPS function, and interesting to know while you are driving.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design, lots of acclaimed features. 
Cons:. For a device that should be accurate, this one misses. 
Summary:. I was very excited about this unit - great feature set and price. If I'd written the CNET review after unpacking the unit and playing with it for a bit, I might have given it an 8 as well. Unfortunately, in actual use I was shocked at the inaccurate performance. All seemed more or less okay - a few questionable routes - until I told it to guide me home on a simple test run from the local grocery. Approaching my street it told me "turn right" - my house is a block down the other direction after a LEFT turn. I tried other street numbers to the left of the turn. The 720 wasn't able to get those right either.. 

$$;
Pros:. good hardware, and fair software. 
Cons:. maps have many mistakes. 
Summary:. I live in San Jose, California, and it seems to me that the maps for such an area ought to be in pretty good shape. They are not.. For example:. 1) Our nearest major cross-street, Curtner Ave., San Jose, CA, crosses Highway 87 at which point the maps the 720 map thinks Curtner is exclusively an only ramp, when in fact it is a through street.. 2) Although tomtom advertises that it can warn you when you go over the speed limit, the maps lack speed limit, or stop sign information for San Jose...thus routing you through suboptimal neighborhoods.. 3) Many left turn lanes on Hamiliton Ave., a main street, are not marks so it will often route you around-the-block to make left turns.. 4) Advertised map correction capabilities are ad hoc and not systematic. You may end up in a multiple choice where you can tell it about a bad left or right turn, but multiple choice options don't handle U-turns or through street mistakes. Also these same options are ambiguous as to whether you are trying to tell it that the particular travel "mistake" should be allowed or is allowed and shouldn't be. Instead it may say something like "left turn error".. 

$$;
Pros:. Sure it has a sleek design, automatic map updates and is easy to use. But those selling this product will leave out a major character flaw.. 
Cons:. My TomTom 720 Go worked beautifully for one year and six months. Then it decided to retire. There is NO WAY to replace the battery in this system, you CAN NOT purchase the battery at any store and the company DOES NOT stand behind it's product.. 
Summary:. If you enjoy spending over $400 dollars on a product and getting only 18 months worth of use then go ahead and buy the TOm Tom 720 Go. The bottom line here is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. When you decide to purchase a GPS system, do your homework and make sure your system is capable of being repaired should it need repairs. There are many companies to choose from. Choose wisely!. 

$$;
Pros:. Overall a good device...bad in the sun...limited phone support. 
Cons:. When I first got this device you could control it from their web software.Now my device is not supported and does not work that way.No explaination,no support,buy thier maps and maybe they will contnue support.. 
Summary:. I would buy a different GPS device ,the support is really bad.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size is good, millions of poi's and map colors available, rubberized case.. 
Cons:. Inaccurate maps(even on the newest models), customer corrections ignored by TomTom, lousy mount, much shorter than advertised battery life, needlessly complex menu, high dollar map updates w/no guarantees of accuracy, hard to see screen in sunlight.. 
Summary:. This units shortfalls and TomTom's "couldn't care less" attitude make me wish I'd done a lot more research before making my purchase. TomTom can rest assured that I won't make that mistake again.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use. 
Cons:. ugly screens, inaccurate POI database, bad directions.. 
Summary:. I can only imagine that those who gave this thing such a high rating have never used a superior product from Garmin or Magellan. I have. And this thing is horrible.. I have never it had it lead me to a POI accurately. It might take you to a correct general area, if you are lucky, and you can drive around and find it. Sometimes it will just lead you to the middle of nowhere. And I have used it in extensively in 6 cities, it is the same everywhere.. The Garmin that I had before I got this thing could give me a time estimate for a trip that was correct within 5-10 minutes for a drive that would take several hours. I have seen this be off by an hour on a two hour drive, that is unacceptable, and it is dumbfouding that its algorhythms are that far off.. And in terms of finding the "fastest route" don't ever trust it. I had lived in an area three years and had a Garmin teach me faster ways to get around. this thing is amazing in its ability to take you the worst possible way to get somewhere.. Sure, you punch in an address, it will take you there. So will any other crappy GPS. It costs too much to be this bad. This is the worst GPS device I have ever used, and would never recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. 
Cons:. points of interest not up to date, misdirection. 
Summary:. we had tom tom for one week. one trip we attempted to find a local restaurant "carrabas" we arived at a mall parking lot and we were told we had arrived. we could not find the restaurant. it turns out it was over 1500 feet away accross a 4 lane road. another trip, told us to get off and than back on the same highway. same trip told us to make three right turns which would have put us to the same location and the correct turn would be a left.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate directions. 
Cons:. Very confusing menues, won't sync with pc, poor display. 
Summary:. I kept this for one day before returning it to Sams and getting a Garmin 750 for the same price ($299). THe menues are a real hassle (How do you cancel a route?), it would not sync with either of my pc's, the display is not near as nice as the Garmin display, the restaruant poi's are poorly organized (no sub catagories for food types).. Save yourself a lot of headache and get a Garmin. Also, Gafmin is a US company, so I support that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ability to locate POI's along route. 
Cons:. Little annoying things. 
Summary:. I was given a TomTom GO 720 as a gift. My husband has a 4-year old Garmin iQue that is more useful than the 720.. 1. Doesn't tell you which side of the road your destination is on. 2. Downtown maps of Seattle are poor, it often asked me to turn into one-way streets from the wrong direction and missed freeway entrances. 3. Gives instructions to stay on the freeway, even though there are no exit ramps in the vicinity. 4. If a Favorite is stored and renamed there is no way to see the address of the favorite. 5. Frequent updates of software from the TomTom Home site resulted in errors. 

$$;
Pros:. Very little. 
Cons:. The latest maps for download are not up to date.. 
Summary:. I worked with the TOM TOM support because the TOMTOM 720 did not recognize streets in my neighbor hood that have been in place for over 10 years. It could not find houses that were built 5 years ago even after they stated I had the current updates. There response to me was, We may have them in our next update in six months. BAD&. 

$$;
Pros:. Best offereing in terms of feature set. 
Cons:. Poor screen visibility, terrible software, poor sound. 
Summary:. I give Tom Tom credit for at least trying to make features available for a portable GPS that should be standard by now. It is a disgrace the Garmin and Magellan the other purported 'market leaders' don't offer an online update service (for free) and a place where users can collaborate to share maps and other information. I appreciate that Tom Tom is trying to allow users to download or create and store custom points of interest. For example, a contractor should be able to ID and enter every home depot in his area as a custom POI. That would be helpful. The problem is the Tom Tom software is horrible. And by horrible I mean unusable. The first time around it outright crashed the GPS to the point I had to return the unit because it was unable to reboot. But because I hate reviews that are not reviews but complaints that the unit never functioned correctly, I will continue... The second time around I was able to get the software running but it is so poorly designed, it is impossible to use. I tried is on both XP Pro and Vista systems but the interface is the bigger problem. Tom Tom phone support was mediocre at best. Other dings include a poor screen visibility in bright sunlight, awful audio (it becomes inaudible at higher volumes due to speaker vibration), and of course sub-standard graphics in today's world. This last point is a fair complaint but is applicable to most other systems I've tired. Those include Magellan, Garmin and Navigon. Magellan was the worst and Navigon was the best in terms of graphics capabilities but in the year 2008 is it asking too much to get better than Nintendo 64 level quality? Seriously. Routing on this unit is poor but from reading other reviews, this is a universal complaint with virtually all portable GPS units as there are too many real-world variables that come in to play such as signal timing, lane configurations and construction that can affect traffic flow patterns. I think we are stuck with the current state of things until a creative and able company comes up with a way to customize routes more directly and share that information with other users. Whoever can do that will win this space. It's too bad there isn't a user forum strictly for tech users that the manufacturers would pay attention to. To me the consumer navigation space is aggravating because the big players are content to let the end user suffer with sub-standard products. And I don't think my standards are too high. My next equity investment in this space will be with the company that can prove they are more concerned with user satisfaction (powerful, flexible, intuitive feature set with real graphics capability) than units shipped. Tom Tom has the right idea - too bad they haven't been able to execute.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not had long enough to know. 
Cons:. Took me 15 miles out the way. 
Summary:. I was very excited about this unit hoping it would give me most of the features found on the Garmin 680 and Magellan 4250. Out the box it loaded pretty quickly. The user menu is not user friendly like the other brands. I found it hard to navigate but figured out how to enter my address.. It was difficult to attach to the window mount with the suction cup attached to the window. It is not a clip, its a slide on mount.. I jumped on the HOV I395 N and the unit told me to pass the exit I would expect to take. It wanted me to exit on the I395 S HOV entrance (talk about a head on collision) My next exit was at the Pentagon, this unit had me go 10-15 miles north out of my way which of course had me go back south another 10-15 miles to get back on course.. I got to the main road that I take to before heading toward my house. The unit wanted me to head south, then west, then north (taking me back to my road that I was on before heading south) before I got home.. All I can say is this unit really sucks when I compare it to Garmin and Magellan. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent features. 
Cons:. Unit continues to shutdown on its own. 
Summary:. I would like nothing better than to give this unit a good rating. The 720 has excellent features, is very fast at re-routing, and allows you to pick which street to avoid when detouring. Now for the bad. The unit continues to sipmly shut down on its own. It has a feature built in that allows it to shutdown when external power is lost, this is great if you have a garage and don't feel like removing from the mount every evening. The problem is that even with that feature disabled, the 720 continues to shutdown when plugged into either the cigarette lighter, or the accessory port. This happens about every 5 mins. When navigating to a destination, you constantly have to hit "cancel" to avoid shutdown in 10secs. As you only have 10 secs, you are distracted from driving, worrying if the unit will shutdown. I have a new 2008 car, and doubted if the problem was with the vehicle. I logged into tomtomforums.com and foudn the thread below. It seems as though the self shutdown is a common problem. It seems clear that this is a software/firmware problem with the unit, and renders it completely unreliable....hence the 3-10 rating.. http://www.tomtomforums.com/showthread.php?t=5251. 

$$;
Pros:. can think of anythings. 
Cons:. Bad to worse. 
Summary:. Unless you work for TOMTOM or got it for FREE this production did more harm than good when you need it. I got one and the road I travel to work every day for 20 years and this TOMTOM got me lost just because I bruoght one for travel and decided to try out first. Instructions and mappind really crab. Don't by it. It will have in the DOLLAR STORE SOON. You could get a buck for one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Screen. 
Cons:. Battery last at best 45 minutes/ Very low bluetooth volume. 
Summary:. I have owned one of these Tom Tom Go 720's for several months. Despite advertised battery life of 5 hours, it has never lasted in use for as long as one hour, and usually shuts off after about 45 minutes of continual use. Not a big problem when using in the car with the car charger, which is supplied, but I had it with me to use in friend's cars a couple times, and didn't have the charger with me, and it pooped out both times before we had reached our destinations. Also, when connected to the bluetooth function of my phone, even on maximum, the volume is WAY too low to hear in a moving car unless you hold it right next to your ear, which completely defeats the purpose, I'd say. All in all, if I had it to do over, I'd get a Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. There is nothing good about. 
Cons:. So many issues, don't know where to start.... 1. Doesn't come up, takes 15min - 30min to show your GPS. 2. Connector is faulty, you have to hold it to get it charged. 3. Voice is garbled, gets cut. 4. Directions are wrong. 5. Costs $$$ ( paid $450). 
Summary:. I went by the CNet reviews and paid a heavy price, called several times the support and they say it's not faulty and tells me to charge it through the computer to improve the latency and other issues. Go for the cheapest one in the market and be happy. I went for Garmin Nuvi and am happy. I feel so sorry for wasting $450 and got stuck + had to buy another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. I didn't get to use the product long enough to have any good experiences.. 
Cons:. After using this product twice the unit completely died, possibly unchargeable battery. TOM TOM customer service refused to fix the unit without a receipt of purchase even though the unit is not even a year old. Bad product, bad customer service!. 

$$;
Pros:. Absolutely Nothing. 
Cons:. Everything. 
Summary:. I bought this GPS system a few days ago and i was fairly excited about it. First few days im jsut checking out its features, then I start to drive with it. EVERY location is off by at least 1/4 of a mile. I realize this is probably just a problem with the specific system, but I expected better. A restaurant was almost a mile off on the GPS. DO NOT BUY IT. Stick with Garmin. My brother bought a garmin and it works great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not many Pros in my book.. 
Cons:. Maps wrong, missing roads, missing major highways, tough to navigate through menu.. 
Summary:. I have the 720 and it has completely let me down numerous times in the past 2 weeks. Before anyone responds to do updates, I do them weekly. Here are a couple of issues recently. I just took a trip to South Carolina from PA and luckily before I left I printed out directions from google maps. Well, I should have trusted Google and not the TomTom. It took me over 200 miles OUT of my way and added nearly 3hrs to my trip. There were times in South Carolina that the road just disappeared on the TomTom and it couldn't find where we even were. This was on a major 6 lane interstate. On the way home, I wasn't paying attention to the way I actually went South and was following the TomTom home. It took me over 2hrs and 140 miles out of my way and put me on a road I should have NEVER been on and I ended up getting a speeding ticket. I wanted to throw this POS out the window. Another problem was on a local trip finding a place friends were meeting one night. I have a friend who was following me w/ a Garmin. He informed me when we finally reached our locations after the TomTom told me I reached my destination over 6 miles away in the middle of a park that his Garmin recalculated over 6 times from the way the TomTom was taking us. Again, this is garbage, don't waste your money!!!!. This garbage is officially for sale!. 

$$;
Pros:. It has more option than garmin for sure. But that does not mean it's better.. 
Cons:. POI is very old.. 
Summary:. I purchased my 720 like 2 weeks ago. Found out later that the POI was very old. Can't even find KHOLS Department store in my area and there's two. Also Souplantation. And these stores were 3 years old. Believe it or not, my friends Garmin 550 which is about 2 years old found the said stores and restaurant. He did not even upgraded his required maps.. So I went to our local costco and tested the garmin and magellan. Oh my, both equipment found the KHOLS and Souplantation.. Anyway, if I haven't been over my required days with the 720. I would have returned this to the store.. By the way, I searched the stores after I downloaded the required maps. (version 715.1712) I believe that's the same version map that they would be using with the 730 when it comes out sometime next month or so.. Plus when I called customer service, she directed me to a website for POI. I asked her if this is with tomtom, she said no. I asked her if I needed to pay, she replied some. What a BS dealings. much much negative.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface - lousy support. 
Cons:. No support for bugs, just buy $oftware/map updates. 
Summary:. I purchase a TomTom for my spouse in September 2007 - Used it three times. When it automaticlly selects a route it said that unpaved roads were part of the route, even though they weren't - contacted support and they informed me that an updated map is available for download for $79 and this will fix my problem - This is the answer to fix my problem - spend more money and hope I don't have another bug or that this will fix the bug I do have.. 

$$;
Pros:. You are allowed to say "check out my new GPS". 
Cons:. You later say "at least it is a mediocre paper weight". 
Summary:. You expect state of the art GPS that will help you go where you want. Being that I am a commuter I felt this was a necessity. But after 10 minutes the strain of stairing at the tiny screen forces me to turn it off. Dont buy the Tom Tom unless you have telescopic vision or plan on using it 5 minutes at a time.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. The company support is horrible. 
Summary:. I really liked my TomTom GO 720. I had it for a little over a year when it stopped working. I contacted TomTom and they told me there was nothing to be done to fix it. They said I would need to purchase a new one (nice gig, there TomTom). So, $300 gets you something that only lasts for a bit over a year. It's not like I used it everyday either. They must be joking....I will never purchase another TomTom product as long as I live.. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen. 
Cons:. bad maps with NO local info. 
Summary:. Took a trip right after I bought this thing and it acted like Alabama doesn't exist. Misses obvious major turns frequently. and local info is non-existent. An update with correct maps is another $100.00 This device is NOT intuitive nor easy to operate. GET A GARMIN!!. 

$$;
Pros:. LOOKS NICE. 
Cons:. WHAY HAVE BLUE TOOTH IF IT DOSENT WORK WITH MOST PHONES AND CALL QUALITY IS THE WORST. 
Summary:. LOOK THIS IS SUPPOST TO BE A PORTABLE UNIT BUT IT TAKES TOO LONG TO REMOVE FROM YOUR CAR TRAFFIC RECIEVER USES A WIRE AND THE POWER SUPPLY USES ANOTHER WIRE I WENT WITH THE GARMIN 760 GOOD CALL QUALITY ONLY ONE WIRE. NO WIRE ON WINDSHIELD AND SCREEN IS 110% BETTER THIS TOM TOM IS A JOKE YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR THAT FOR SHURE..
