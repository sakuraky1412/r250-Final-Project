for a weekend in st malo this hotel was a great choice .
located just inside the city walls , it 's easy to find and walking distance to everywhere ( an easy 10 mins from the ferry port ) .
the higher rooms would have nice views either across the port or into the old city itself .
yes the rooms and bathrooms are small but it 's as you 'd expect from an ibis , but unlike you 'd expect from an ibis you 're staying in a beautiful old building full of history and character , so i was happy to make some concessions on size .
the bed was comfy , shower hot and strong , windows doubleglazed to keep noise out , wifi free and fast , room perfectly clean .
only downside was the walls were a bit thin so if nextdoor is having a room party , you 'll know about it .
the lobby area has a chill-out bar with free tea and coffee in the afternoons and a great free breakfast included .
best of all was the service - all of the receptionists i met were friendly and helpful and english was no problem .
special mention to nicolas who enthusiastically gave me sightseeing and restaurant recommendations ( he 's a former chef ) and when i mentioned i was late for my dinner reservation he even rang ahead and begged the chef to keep the kitchen open !
above and beyond for most 5 star hotels , so especially appreciated at an ibis .
great place to stay , will . . .
