a ryokan but with quite a lot of concessions to western tastes/requirements eg traditional bedrooms but flat screen tvs and wifi .
an onsen with hair driers in the changing rooms .
the shuttle bus will take you from the ferry landing to the hotel but the ten minute drive is deceptive as the hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the main shrine/tori gate for which miyajima is famous .
it is a 'traditional ' japanese inn but on several floors and looks quite modern from the outside .
however , the japanese style rooms are nicely done with balconies overlooking a stream and woods ( with deer ) and sliding paper screens .
dinner is served either in your room or an adjacent one while they make up the bed .
its is a multi course kaiseki meal and not to everyon'es taste : we did n't enjoy the shark 's fin paste at all and the steak was nowhere near the quality we had had in kyoto .
breakfast ( western or japanese ) is served in the dining room and was good though not much fruit on offer .
the onsen was superb and very quiet ( one other person ) when i used it .
plenty of towels , wash cloths spare shavers in the spotlessly clean changing rooms .
staff were charming and friendly and spoke excellent english .
the only downside is that the décor and furniture looked a bit tired and in some cases knocked about which was disappointing given that it was . . .
