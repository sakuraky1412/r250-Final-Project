for everybody complaining about 3rd party apps not working , run it in compatibilaty mode for xp .
no offense to xp users , but xp is ugly .
i 'm sticking with vista .
it 's a awesome product .
i upgraded back in early 07 to windows vista from xp and have never looked back since .
i cant believe vista gets such a slagging off when it did what microsoft indented for it which is to become much more secure than previous windows platforms .
everyone knows how bad xp is even with the service packs .
i know windows 7 will be better yet and have already given it a try .
defo recommend 7 , but vista should not be given a wide berth as its an awesome op system and if you give it some time you will realise just how good it is .
i got windows vista today for only 5 dollars on ebay .
what a deal .
i updated my windows xp computer , changed the task bar to the windows 7 kind , and now i am good to go .
plenty of drivers .
much better games than osx .
mac just simply sucks period .
all works great for me .
if you have a 7 year printer and other hardware that should be about right for the current linux releases , as that is about that far behind it is .
i just tried 3 new different linux favors and all were just as pitful as i checked them 4 years ago .
they could not find my on internet hardware , my scanner , printer , and on board sound .
windows vista has received it 's share of criticism from people for it 's user account control -LRB- which is very easily disabled -RRB- to it 's buggyness -LRB- which is almost completely a thing of the past , thanks to service pack 1 , to it 's compatibility issues with some xp compatible hardware and software for a high end system it 's a no brainer .
windows vista is built from the ground up to make good use of dual and quad core processors and post sp1 even 32 bit systems can make good use of ram greater than 3 .
25gb , when xp is originally coded , a high end pc might have had 128mb ram , dual core did not exist and dual processors only existed in high end servers windows vista 's media center blows away xp 's .
the features , polished look and functionality in the vista version far surpass that of xp a low end system can not support the hard disk , cpu and memory requirements that are necessary to run an advance operating system like windows vista .
much of the complaining came from people that were trying to run a next gen os on old hardware fixing windows vista is far easier than xp .
suppose you have an unbootable system , meaning you can not even boot from safe mode .
with xp , your best option is to boot from a installation cd and use the recovery console in vista , it 's far easier .
you can boot from the installation dvd and attempt a system restore , or start up repair .
this will usually put the pc in a bootable state doing clean installations in vista is much easier if you still have your product key , but have lost your installation dvd .
in xp , there are scores of different types of discs , that each take their own product keys -LRB- home/pro .
oem/retail/vlk / refurb -RRB- and attempting to install from a different type of disc using your legitimate product key will not work unless it is the specifically correct disc .
in vista , you only need one disc .
you just need to remember whether you want a 32 bit or 64 bit disc , depending on what version of the os you want to install .
the reviewer actually also brought this up the windows update system no longer requires you to visit the microsoft update website to manually update .
now windows update has been properly integrated into the os , and works better than ever i highly recommend that anyone who wishes to build a quad core or dual core pc consider vista ultimate .
i think it is better than xp , and expecially the macintosh .
it is very stable and has never crashed on me once since i bought a few months ago .
if you 're a mac or linux fanboy , stop being stubborn and do n't install it .
with a closed mind you wo not get any far with this os .
so , if you 're among em ' get away .
get to know the system and it 'll offer you what it 's got .
this biggest complaint i hear from folks is that they do n't like the new interface of vista .
i work at an electronics store , and run vista on my laptop and desktop and love it .
the problem with the folks who complain about the interface is that they hardly spend time with it .
people forget that when xp came out , many folks were hating the interface of that as well and were recommending folks to go back to either windows 2000 or 98 .
people are creatures of habit so the interface will take a bit of time of getting used to but you have to be willing to put in that time .
once you do , vista is a great os i say that vista is the best initial release of any windows os in the last ten years because of its security .
remember xp when it first came out .
spyware , malware , viruses , and worms were commonplace until service pack 2 is released .
xp did turn out to be a fine os but that did n't happen until sp2 is released .
with vista , microsoft made sure they did n't repeat the same mistakes .
vista , by far , has much more security features on its initial release than xp .
granted , this is not going to stop every piece of spyware from entering your system , but it will drastically cut down on the amount that does enter your system the system is more stable than xp is .
i never had this problem , but many folks did , with xp crashing .
vista is built on a more stable system and the possibilities of it crashing are slim to none the new design is very sleek and pleasant to look at .
the new windows aero feature gives the windows and bars a transparent/glossy finish to it .
you can even customize the color scheme that you want to have .
the gadgets involved with vista are extremely nice to have and are convenient .
you can customize the sidebar to include news of any kind , weather , stock quotes , stick notes , tools such as calculators , and the list just goes on and on .
vista is much more suitable for a person with little to no computer experience and is better organized .
microsoft renamed/divided some of the areas of the os up so people could find them easier .
vista also uses pictures to illustrate what a certain area of the os does to help those who are n't familiar with a computer or windows based os people complain that there is not a search feature on the desktop of vista .
first off , this is false as there is a google toolbar on the bottom right of your desktop .
second , there is a search feature right as you hit the start button -LRB- displayed as the windows icon on the bottom left corner -RRB- so there is one right there if , for some reason , your vista does not have the google search box on the desktop .
third , going back to the first point a bit , people complain about there not being a search box on the vista desktop because mac leopard has a search feature on their desktop .
this is true , however , the magnifying glass is in the way upper right corner of the desktop that it 'll be difficult for most folks to find .
people say the learning curve for the new leopard is extremely easy but i found it to be pretty difficult and finding a search box -LRB- which is one of the first things i looked for -RRB- is extremely hard to locate all in all , windows vista is a solid os .
the only complaint i hear about it is that the interface is not what the person desired .
this is a petty complaint and folks , once again , need to be reminded of xp when it is first released .
over a short period of time , people began to love the interface and people will begin to love the new vista interface as well .
the only drawback is that it does need more ram and a bit more hard drive space .
if your computer is more than two years old , i would wait until you purchase a new system .
it 's much more secure than xp is initially and easier to move about than mac leopard .
xp is a nice os in and of itself but it had too many security issues during its initial release .
microsoft corrected such problems and made a more secure , stable , fun , and easy to get around operating system .
dont let the pundits desuade you from this .
the blogs are wrong .
vista is a modern , mature os that leaves the user with a feeling of satisfation from using it .
vista is a decent os .
i upgraded my last laptop and liked it enough to request my current computer be installed with vista .
it 's good stuff .
give it a chance and see for yourself .
do not listen to the anti vista fanboys bent on not moving into the future .
just make sure your computer is gon na all be compatible with the operating system .
best os from microsoft so far .
i think vista is a huge improvement over xp ; do not get me wrong , i still like xp .
one of the major improvements is the user interface .
this is one of the reasons why i use vista 9/10 times that i 'm on the computer and as i stated as the con requires higher end hardware .
that is true , but that is also the reason why i love vista my computer takes full advantage of what vista has to offer .
i ve got a custom built gaming computer , thus a gaming computer goes well beyond vista recommended requirements .
well , the review is biased about all versions of vista and the search being burried .
i have vista ultimate , the search is only one click away on the start panel i am an avid gamer and do a lot of the benchmarks as well .
tweakvi on vista allows you to use caching on your processor which improved the speed of my processor as well as adding an additional +2000 points to my 3dmark06 score as well i 've never once had a problem with vista and i play all of the latest games .
if you have problems with vista , you must not know how to optimize it for your needs or just do not understand how the internals work because it 's just way better .
i love this os .
it is pretty and fast .
fantastic .
vista is the best operating system for desktop users ever written .
it is by far more stable , user friendly , and capable than anything before it the graphical presentation of the o/s is downright beautiful , with actual 3d effects integrated into the gui indexing integrated into almost everything makes searching many times faster than anything xp had to offer as far as stability goes , vista has unparalleled compatibility and handling of program crashes .
so your app stinks and it crashed , that 's no reason for the o/s to die too .
vista handles these things no sweat dx10 enough said .
you play games or like games .
dx10 is the new standard .
every gaming developer in the world is striving to make their new games dx10 ready .
combined with a dx10 capable video card , you are in for some visual effects that no console or any other o/s can touch .
resource usage the biggest complaint i 've heard from people about vista is that is sucks up resource on their old , skunky pcs .
stop yer whining and upgrade .
upgrading from xp to vista is like upgrading your house say from a 2 bedroom/1bath in the ghetto to a 5 bedroom/4bath in a nice neighborhood .
your pc is like the furnace , ac , plumbing , electical , etc .
you can not use the same furnace , ac , plumbing , electrical , etc .
from our old house in the new one .
time to upgrade .
if your pc is beyond 3 years old , it 's a dinosaur already and needs to go .
there is a price to pay to run the best o/s in the universe , and that price is hardware .
get new stuff , get the new o/s , and be bask in the glory of vista .
i have a core 2 duo processor , 160 gb harddrive , 2gb memory , and a nice asus motherboard .
if you have these hardware your windows vista ultimate will be extremely fast and entertaining .
i think it 's the best windows yet .
secure and everything .
it is impossible to name all the features .
why is everyone so against microsoft .
vista works .
do not believe the naysayers .
those who argue about compatability ignore the fact that innovation always has some impact on compatability .
always .
vista is miles ahead of xp in my opinion .
i am not a computer expert but i know a good product .
i am totally satisfied with vista .
its totally worth investing in this product .
its stability is unbelieveable , i hav not encountered a crash yet .
the gui is much more advanced than windows xp .
this is such a worthy upgrade from xp that it is ridiculous .
one of the most notiecable things for me is that programs can run even when the computer is locked .
such as defragmenter .
it hasnt missed a schedule yet .
and when i dock my zune , the software opens up and synchronizes while it is locked .
yay .
ps aero pwns .
microsoft has done done an a + + job .
this is a huge update from windows xp .
if you are getting a new computer windows vista is a must buy .
blows linux out of the water and actually works very well .
support the devlopers buy commercial software .
i think mac users that are judging and rating the product a 1 only by screenshots are morons thats my opinion .
other than that asta la vista , apple and mac n trash users .
do not waste your time reading these reviews just a sounding board for people who hate ms .
a quien no le guste que no lo compre esta excelente el programa y espero que haya pronto aplicaciones para este .
otra cosa lo que mas me gusta es que no permite que se te congele la pc os windows vista signature edition 10315/25000 .
wonderfull product , finaly microsoft creates a product that is close to osx .
i have been using vista for a year now , and xp now looks like garbage to me now .
drivers work great , features are intense .
upgrade memory over 1gb and invest in a high memory graphics card , or get a new pc prior to installing .
excellent memory management and is far superior to xp 's it recognized all my hardware i only had to manually install 1 driver which is for x fi audio card very intuitive , easy to figure out and very informative as well .
help and faq is very nice much more difficult to mess anything up now .
some people do experience issues but i havent experienced any , its extremely stable on my system .
vista is the best os from microsoft in a long time .
it is much more than an upgrade from xp .
at first glance it looks very similar to xp which is nice to prevent a steep learning curve .
the search is great for people with lots of files , music , photos , or programs .
it is very visually appealing , and easy on the eyes .
the preview windows make it very easy to organize your windows .
i also love the fact that installation of applications and hardware are incredibly easy .
installing my printer took nothing more than a simply plugging it in .
on xp had to install from cd etc etc .
vista is also fast .
makes great use of ram and dual core processors if you have it available .
ready boost is a great way to add some cheap ram too .
there are of course a ton of haters , but you really have to just try it for yourself .
yes vista requires 512megs of ram and recomends 1 2 gigs but honestly would n't you be disapointed if it did not push the envelope for hardware .
also vista works great in conjunction with office 12 which is about as cool as a productivity suite could possibily be .
gave it a ten because as of yet i can not think as to how it could be improved .
xp is decent , vista 's got it nailed .
why did i upgraded to a vista .
because of very good experience with windows xp why guys are giving vista system less than 7 .
either they do n't know what to do with os to keep it running or they are using mac or linux etc systems and they hate everything else .
they just do n't know windows vista deserved 8 9 i gave it 10 to balance bad review points you wo not regret your new purchase .
long live microsoft .
the install of vista on my hp multimedia box is seamless and did not require me to go find 64 bit drivers for any of my hardware .
vista had all the 64 bit drivers i needed right out of the box .
i is using xp 64 bit but i had to download drivers for that version .
it even identified all my network connections and even set up my hp printer on the network for me , automatically i even bought one of the windows xp life cam 's and it did not need an installed driver .
vista found it and loaded in the right one for the 64 bit side here .
so , no , i do not know why the 32 bit crowd would upgrade at this time but the performance for us 64 bit machine users is incredible .
everything is a whole lot faster in the core 2 duo world here and that is where everyone will be over the next few years .
the release of 64 bit vista with the 32 bit one has created a whole new class of users , 64 bit windows users .
am cautat acesr prous de mult timp si nu lam gasist va multumesc .
window vista is very excellent but marketing sales is wrong time .
bill gate .
is helping a lot of poor people and good heart .
if rich people like bill gate , the .
world will better in short , i will try my .
best all my custom using window vista from tony cheng .
windos vista ultimate is the pest product from microsoft which is easy and simple for the bigginer and very helpfull too .
i wish that everyone have a chance to try it and see the world of magic in it .
xaml candy .
although you came up with a good commercial , windows still dominates and will keep dominating .
great interface , easy to use , more secure , fun to test , the list goes on .
keep up the good work microsoft , hats off to mr .
gates .
tested for 50 + hours , aero is nothing short of spectacular .
switching in between windows is more entertaining than the mac commercial .
plus all the business i am going to get upgrading pc 's i love you guys .
thanks again , i will be upgrading -LRB- and others -RRB- my pc asap .
vista is so much better than rotten apple what a piece of not nice thing that frankenstein os .
wow , i can not believe their are still people using mandarin orange .
or pear .
or apple .
windows vista utilmate is entirely recommended .
buy it .
windows vista ultimate does not put search on the desktop -LRB- it 's buried within applications , within the start menu -RRB- .
funny on my microsoft windows vista business i got for free through msdnaa , search is buried right next to the shut down button , right when you click the start menu -LRB- i 'm sorry that clicking on the windows button with the left button of a mouse is too much trouble for seemingly physically challenged cnet editors -RRB- optimized only for the microsoft windows ecosystem -LRB- for example , rss feeds from internet explorer 7 get preferential treatment -RRB- .
unheard of a company optimizing their os for their software .
i imagine mac os x -LRB- for instance -RRB- is not optimized for the apple mac os ecosystem -LRB- i 'm sure safari , quicktime and isight do n't get preferential treatment , no , of course not -RRB- there 's simply too much and not all of it is implemented properly .
interesting someone complaining for getting too much for what the money they paid .
then criticising that many things are not properly implemented and not giving a single example no new software yet written exclusively for windows vista .
curious the fact that companies do not have programs written exclusively for windows vista before it is even released to the general public is a flaw of the os .
i 'm excited to see if this will be mentioned when cnet tests leopard before it is released too .
how can an os not have any programs written exclusively for it before it is even released .
incredible there are too many editions of windows vista .
amusing someone complaining for having such thing as too much choice .
yes , i think the typical joe will haver a tuff time deciding between vista enterprise , vista business and vista home premium .
does cnet even know windows is used by businesses , unlike mac os .
just asking p .
obviously not a perfect os -LRB- thus not worth a ' 10 ' but a ' 9 ' , imho -RRB- , but i give it a ' 10 ' to balance with the ridiculous ' 1 's from ignorant apple fanboys .
early builds of vista seem like a massive improvement over xp .
finding documents and programs is very easy and it just looks very cool if you do not like cool new stuff , do like reviewer robert vamosi wait .
his recipe recipe for progress .
i have used vista many times before , even at the time when it is called longhorn .
as a resident in washington living next to microsoft and having friends to work there i got to use vista on countless occasions , and let me tell you that its not overated and is necessary for people who enjoy pictures , videos , music and just doing work on .
overall i liked the design its very nice .
i also liked the search bar and the side toolbar which allows you to put apps you use frequentlly .
i really think that the new features vista has are very nice and work beautilflly .
as for the price , its not that great but new egg has pretty good deals as well as ebay -LRB- maybe -RRB- .
if you dont want to spend the money then just wait for it to go cheaper , or buy the lowest version .
if you plan on getting a new pc .
it will probablly have vista pre installed overall i really liked the design and functions vista has to offer and i offer it a 10 becuase microsoft did a nice job with features and everything .
to offset by mrpiddly1 biased macboy ignorant stance .
i like it very much because vista has mace my computer run more faster than windows 7 .
i think that the main reason that people are not happy with vista is because they were not prepared for major change that vista is to xp .
there are plenty of people who insisted on using older computers to run vista then got mad when they found out the 512mb of ram that go them by on xp would not work with vista .
i 've been using vista on my laptop with only 1gb of ram for over a year with vista home premium installed and it work pretty well .
if i had a newer computer that has comparable hardware to the macs that came with leopard on them , vista would run like a king during the early stages of vista , i even switched back to xp , for like a day before i got frustrated with the thing and quickly reinstalled vista and have been happy sense .
not sure about the unfairly low rating of vista .
have been running vista ultimate for over a year and a half with a ton of different kinds of software and hardware with no problems -LRB- granted this is on a custom built desktop with blow your mind specs -RRB- .
if you are reading this , you probably spend a considerable portion of time in front of your computer and value it more than your car or tv .
getting to know , and yes adjust to vista , will not take a lot of effort or time .
vista is like new coke .
it tastes exactly the same , but it 'll make countless muppets write their useless blogs and posts about it .
windows 7 and whatever the heck that linux clone unbuntu is will not solve your problems .
like i said above with the right hardware vista is a joy to run , i use xp at work and i miss my rig at home when i 'm there .
there are so many useful tools built right into vista .
it certainly is not the best os and microsoft made mistakes but it is usable in a personal environment .
i have used windows vista ever since it is released , and love it .
now when i have to use xp on other computers its like going back to the stone age .
vista is -LRB- in my opinion -RRB- the best operating system yet .
you just need to give it chance .
i am running on a system with 4gb ram , amd athlon 6400 + x2 ~ 3 .
3ghz cpu , and an evga 8800gts 512 mb gpu .
i currently am running windows vista ultimate 64 bit .
i originally heard that vista crashes a lot and it has a lot of errors , but for me at least , that is not true .
windows vista has a lot of cool features , and barely any compatibility issues for me .
the updates are good and just the layout of it is great .
i have to give microsoft a pat on the back for releasing vista because i am not going to go back to xp .
i do not feel the need to .
vista has too many features to offer and almost none of which are in the previous release .
also , if you want to run games for windows and play in directx10 like me , then upgrading is a good idea .
ok , but there are a few down sides the installation is big , windows defender sucks , and it takes about 800mb of ram on idle -LRB- good thing i got 4gb of ram -RRB- so , overall , i give vista a 9/10 .
wow i really do n't see is it that people do n't like this os .
its fast reliable viruses rarely infect it .
do not listen to the bull that others say about this because none of its true .
also sp1 also speeds up the computer giving it the same performance as xp .
also when people complain saying xp is faster , thats the same thing as saying windows 2000 is faster than xp .
windows vista is the most advanced and useful operating system on the market today .
there is absolutely no reason not to upgrade from windows xp .
it is crash free and works flawlessly .
it 's usability features make things much easier than with xp .
a must buy .
i waited until the bugs were worked out of this version then installed the latest copy .
took 38 minutes for a full install , when completed , wireless network , internet worked excellent .
had a few drivers to install , which is not a problem .
i would recommend ultimate for anyone 's computer as long as it is running at least 4 gb of ram , sata hdd , and 256 mg video card .
i have had this installed for almost a month now , no glitches , crashes , and shutdown or restart only takes 9 or 10 seconds .
this is a time saver and as of this writing , this is the absolute best os i have owned and i have had them all , except me , which is a total failure .
well worth the time to install , but a bit pricey .
be sure to load as much ram memory as your system will hold and you will be amazed at the performance this os delivers .
i would rate if a 9 because i have not had this long and do not know what the future will bring .
i love it .
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa .
the best operating system out there .
despite all the negative hoopblah and hyperbolie , windows vista ultimate edition is a rock solid operating system for a new os built from the ground using the windows server 2003 codebase .
every aspect of vista is handcrafted code that has security in mind .
however , with all that new code comes some problems .
however , to my experiences the issues are minor and just annoying .
not enough to take away the overwhelming good things microsoft has done in vista ultimate edition first of all , we have the very beautiful aero graphics interface .
we have translucent screens that allow you to see whats behind it .
the dark purplish/greyish color looks great .
the new start orb is a great evolution of the start button .
the built in search menu makes searching a snap .
frequently used programs are put in the start menu and the all programs shows everything .
graphically , the new internet explorer is elegent and easy on the eyes .
very simple to use and we finally get tabbed browsing that firefox users have enjoyed for sometime .
vista is visually a very easy and graphic intensive os .
microsoft is finally taking advantage of this generations new graphics cards new applications include windows calendar , windows mail , internet explorer 7 .
0 , and windows media player 11 .
there are tons of additional applications , but these are the highlights .
all are built with new features and with security in mind where vista falls short is the fact is that vista is prone to bsod 's .
-LRB- thats blue screens of death . -RRB-
drivers are n't being well written by manufactuers even though they 've had 18 months since beta 1 upto launch to work on it .
this is the same issues we had with windows xp .
second , the file copy is ridiculously slow .
thankfully , patches and sp1 will take care of that .
third , many video games do n't work very well in vista .
honestly , microsoft needs to take it back and redo that part from the ground up .
however , some games work just fine in vista .
it 's hit or miss with games i also do n't like the fact that microsoft can browse your machine .
its a privacy concern that needs to be addressed .
nobody needs to look in machines , not even the u .
s goverment without a warrent .
this is the one time where i feel that liberty is more important than the security the ultimate extras have been few to see .
i think they really did let customers down with that .
however , the ones that did come out were great .
we just need more of them in terms of performance , vista has outperformed os x 10 .
4 in terms of security by a huge margin .
much less in terms of critical and important vunerabilites and patches .
even the new os x 10 .
5 has had issues that make vista look like a champion .
even linux based oses can not compete with the beauty , elegence , functionality , quick security response , and overall performance of vista microsoft does have its work cut out .
the ultimate extras , file copy , video game function , and bsod 's need to be resolved .
however , strickly in the performance as an os , i feel that vista surpasses xp in many areas .
i feel that vista is right there with windows 2000 and not windows me .
we all had initial issues with vista , but the security and reliability is there the fujitsu lifebook a 3040 that i tested vista on is much more reliable than the original xp home edition with all of its patches .
the gq 6310 machine from fry 's electronics that i tested originally came with an sempron processor , a terrible hard drive , and only 512 memory of ddr 2 533 mhz .
vista home basic ran decently on it .
however , after upgrading the processor an athlon 64x2 dualcore , a brand new ati hd video card with 512 mb of ddr 2 video memory , upgrading the memory to 1 gigabyte ddr2 533 mhz , replacing the hard drive , and upgrading to ultimate edition ; resolved about 90 percent of the hangups i had with vista recently , i upgraded the memory from 1 gigabyte of ddr2 running at 533mhz to 2 gigabytes of ddr2 running at 800mhz .
my bsod 's became history .
quick and nimble reboots and file copy upgrades have brought vista up to speed .
from a machine that could barely run vista home basic to a fully upgraded vista ultimate premium machine , with some tlc and knowledge , vista can be a very reliable os my best advice for new adoptees of vista is the following 1 .
dual or quad core .
enough said 2 .
fast memory at least ddr2 .
ddr3 if you can get it 3 .
a very reliable hard drive brand like seagate or western digital 4 .
a powerful memory laiden graphics card to run aero 5 .
the most recent and newest drivers for all your peripherals and internals 6 .
avoid upgrading single core , older than 2006 xp machines .
if it is built in 2005 and does not have a dualcore , ddr 2 memory , and a pci express 16x slot , or serial ata devices do not bother upgrading it to vista .
quite simply , you 'll have more problems than you can imagine .
xp machines unless they have the previous do not run vista well .
vista is really for the latest and greatest hardware .
quite simply , upgrade your hardware or stay with xp .
best choice , custom build or buy a new machine bottom line , patience .
after sp 1 is out , vista will have the maturity to calm the vista haters .
it will be a great os following the lineage of 2000 and xp .
it just needs a lil time to mature .
but for those of us who early adopted it and figured it out , we have less to worry about than xp , os x , or linux owners .
we have the most secure os on the market .
once sp 1 is out , we 'll see the masses finally adopt vista .
remember xp 's launch problems .
it took 2 service packs to fix its issues .
how fickle and forgetful people get .
just go get it , play with it , honor the specs i 've laid out and you 'll be smooth sailing with vista .
looks good , once you remove the incompatables the software upgrade is possible -LRB- i had to go online , the instructions do not tell you to uninstall the incompatable programs that the indian techs know all about -RRB- once installed it is good looking , super stability , fast on a fast machine -LRB- mine is 3 ghz dual core -RRB- and you can control lots of things without knowing all the hidden programs on xp .
still not 100 % controllable without buying some books or it would have been a 10 .
i do n't care what people are saying , it 's really great os its little slow on some part , but with 2gb ram .
it runs very smooth so far , i do not have any problame .
i decided to upgrade to vista ultimate after a hard drive crash with xp .
run a dell xps 600 so drivers is not a big issue .
i started from scratch .
been rally happy took the time to search for updated drivers and updating the operating system love the gadgets and widgets and the dreamscene .
background .
it has been stable for me i worked with mac tiger and did not care for the outlay and the one click .
too use to r clicking i guess that vista is great with new equipment and that backward compatibility is like trying to put your old truck seats in your brand new 2007 sports car .
i am on my second new model computer since installing vista ultimate .
the first one is a gateway tablet pc -LRB- windows vista capable -RRB- with 2gb ddr2 ram , intel core 2 duo processor 120 gb hard drive , it came installed with xp , i upgraded to vista ultimate and it killed my computer .
i then after weeks on the phone with the bangalor india call center for microsoft finally bough a new computer and made sure i met all the specifications they told me to have .
i purchased an ibm/lenovo thinkpad z61t with a core 2 duo processor , 3gb ddr2 ram , a 120 gb hard drive , i disabled all the extra visuals in vista , and now finally 5 months later , after downloading 4 7 updates each and every day have a stable environment , but i had to shut off almost all of the vista items that made vista different than xp to get here .
the only benefit to this os is the search feature .
do not waste your money .
windows vista is a great os .
many people thinks it 's a sluggish os but maybe on older machines .
on current hardware and future ones it will be just perfect .
remember the reaction of the people when windows xp is introduced and many ones thought that xp is just a windows 2000 with skins .
great , runs my cpu way faster than vista .
dx10 looks amazing with bioshock , takes absolute advantage of quad core technology .
is a memory hog though .
recommend 4 gigs .
there are a few things that can be changed -LRB- defragmentation screen -RRB- , but overall it 's pretty good .
when i found out about microsoft windows vista ultimate , i instantly liked how it worked and decided to try a beta of it .
the first did not please me very much , but the third did and i decided that i would upgrade all of the company pcs with vista as soon as it gained enough profits to do so .
later , i upgraded on one of my pcs .
it is made about two years ago , so the graphics features and everything else worked without a problem .
you may fear driver problems , but as long as the pc is made recently with a decent video card -LRB- at least 64 mb -RRB- it will work .
you may fear spending $ 399 for it , but on new pcs you can get it oemed for about $ 200 .
for old pcs , you can get an upgrade for $ 259 .
if you get program problems with older applications , then right click the program , click properties , and click the compatibiltity tab .
if i should review this software in one sentence , then windows vista really is software worth purchasing .
too often people look at what vista fails to do / what they have ` copied ' instead of what they 've created .
but remember the mac os is not the first to think of file indexing , nor were they the first to create an mp3 player .
vista has a lot more transparent features that many people fail to see .
you tell me if mac as anything comparable superfetch , readyboost , readydrive , dreamscene , groupshot , aero , directx10 , previous versions/shadow copy , live previews , meeting space , bitlocker , uac -LRB- optional -RRB- , kernel patch protection , address space layout randomization , mobility , sideshow , dataexecution prevention , application isolation , service hardening , network access protection , crypto nexgen , efs , user mode driver framework , mstsc .
the list goes on and on people there are many features included with vista that everyone will benefit from .
and there are many more that make this os very useful and secure .
this is windows finest os to date .
i have been using it since the end of january/07 and have not had a problem yet that 's something for microsoft .
counter to cnet reviewer , there is a desktop search engine yahoo on my ultimate os .
it requires lots of memory but with its built in ready boost , simply plug in a ubs flash and voila you have all the memory you want or need .
what about the pro of the enhanced windows 2 way firewall .
or its user account manager .
did we forget about windows live center .
you need to do more research before you post a review that is only one paragraph .
many options .
good product .
it really is an excellent os .
finding the drivers i needed is a breeze and all my programs work .
it looks excellent and i love the sidebar as well as the backup and restore system it has .
many mac users complain that it is a ripoff of osx , which it is to some degree , except that it improves many functions and adds many as well .
the only problem is that a poor computer can not run much of it , but if you have an old computer there is really no reason to upgrade now instead of waiting to buy a new computer .
as someone who 's been using vista since pre beta2 builds , i have to say i 'm rather comfortable with the new system .
to claim that it is little more than ` xp sp2 warmed over ' is quite an ignorant understatement and i 'm disapointed at the editor for that summary .
security issues with xp pro , even with top of line corporate grade security software installed , to the point i is actually considering moving to linux .
the ammount of work which has gone into the security side of things is really being missed .
as a graphics/digital arts teacher am also making good use of the readyboost feature , which has my system running vista ultimate better than it ever ran xp as with any os -LRB- and i think this is where os x always falls short -RRB- , most will end up tweaking to suit their needs , but even that is easier than it is in xp over all i think ms for once has done an outstanding job and i wish ppl would get of their soapboxes and give it a good run .
sure there are a few little niggles here and there , but software support is so far improved from when xp is first released , and let 's face it is there such a thing as a perfect operating system .
after usingvista on a friends laptop , i do not know how lived without .
love the new interface , about a hundred times better than xp , loved the sidebar and i just search for the files i want from the start menu .
-LRB- 3d -RRB- flipping is really useful not to mention fun .
to use still , microsoft needs to think of ways to improve on this .
windows vista ultimate has many new and great features , especially windows aero , in my opinion .
it does require higher end hardware , but if you have a good enough computer and is a tech enthusiast , then i feel it is worth getting it .
i do not care what mac users want to say .
they can have their mac and i can have my new sony vaio w / vista .
i recommend you have at leat 1gb ram .
i bought vista and it is great .
i like it a lot and the only problem that i have is compatibility issues with a drawing program .
i like the new features and so far everything is working fine .
the vaio i bought is widows vista capable so it came with xp .
for $ 9 .
00 i got the vista i have been able to do everything as before but with style .
mac users , you can always switch to vista since you are always so eager to try microsoft products .
we , on the other hand , can care less about leopard , cheetah , or the zoo apple computers have develop for the 200 apple users worlwide -LRB- haha .
just a joke get over it my friends .
it is funny to see people buying apple computers and paying premium prices to use powerpoint , word , and exel .
i tried the beta , it destroyed my computer with crashes and non starts .
i bought the retail , and enjoyed the stability of how it ran .
i really enjoy the new look and feel .
i like what i am seeing with new drivers coming out and their update process .
i really like the embedded search feature dreamscenes came out and it made that extra purchase for ultimate worth every penny .
if you are a graphic junkie -LRB- like me -RRB- and like the bells and whistles then ultimate is the way to go .
i now have desktops that are animated with a slick os to boot .
i see a lot of bad press , but coming from someone that cursed the beta to no end , i am very impressed and satisfied with my purchase .
i am still having minor driver issues -LRB- i .
e printer , anti virus , and some others , but overall my sound and video drivers -LRB- the basic kind work great . -RRB-
c c 3 , bf2142 , and wow all work without os issues in the end if you need all of your drivers to be functional wait for them to update to vista .
read up on the new features and be prepared to learn some new workarounds to the user program control function -LRB- or just turn it off -RRB- sometimes i have to run programs as administrator to get them to run , which is a right click and select type of option .
if you are looking for the next best slick looking os then ultimate is the way to go .
first cnet let 's get one thing straight , a 2 .
16ghz pentium m processor will run windows vista ultimate like nobody 's business .
interesting that your upgrade advisor only rated my much better than average build m70 workstation as barely compatible with home basic .
folks , if you do n't want or need vista simply do n't get it .
if you bought a new computer that came with it and you do n't like it , by all means return it and get your money back on the other hand , if your kind of geeky or work with computers regularly and are up to a challenge then you might want to check this os out .
if your new to computers but adventerous i do not think you 'll be disappointed beyond that , yes buying a mac is the best bet .
as i 've been told by my mac friends , it works right out of the box .
no imagination needed i made sure when i ordered this mobile workstation that i would be able to load and run vista ultimate right beside xp on the other partition .
pity those who think that microsoft should put out a high powered os but expect it to run on their $ 400 budget machine .
listening to people bad mouth it about it taking up memory and is slow is all wrong i brought the full vista ultimate package .
i have had better reliability and performance from it than i had with any other version yet .
i have yet to find major or even minor problems other than adobe shockwave player not working , but after using 64 bit linux i do not miss that feature i like how it is such a good competitor to mac osx tiger and leopard because of the new multimedia features and the improve security and reliability .
the user account control -LRB- uac -RRB- does get in the way if you have a habit of downloading and doing system wide modifications , but when you get it set up the way you want you will hardly notice it being there .
and as far as the reliability , the new ceip allows microsoft to gather information on what programs and features to improve those i like to that it fixes itself , and if it can not fix it , it tries to find solutions on microsoft 's website , and then if it can not it sends an error report and if necessary , asks for permission to send a file with information on the cause of the problem windows vista is the most advanced os in the world for the next year and longer .
at least until windows vienna comes out good job microsoft os teams .
windows vista ultimate is the best os to date for pc .
feature packed highly crash resistant .
i have been reading many posts , and i see the problems most of you are having first make sure your system is fast enough .
do not even consider using it on an old machine and second , be patient for upcoming updates and fixes and download as they become available .
sp1 will address most issues , remember xp kiddies .
as of now i am dual booting along side xp on a separate hard drive and yes not all drivers programs work or work well as of yet , but remember too if you want to run all your antiquated programs , just stick with your old system and os to begin with .
ok first , i am going to address everyone who likens vista to os x , or says that microsoft is copying mac ; .
lets look at this logically .
a feature of windows is windows aero , including the 3d scroll -LRB- totally cool -RRB- transparent windows , live previews etc .
lets look at mac os x , i do n't see any of that , and i have looked .
in fact , look at this new mac os x leopard -LRB- i think that 's what it is called -RRB- .
what is new in os leopard , a new way to search through open windows -LRB- vista rip off -RRB- , gadgets -LRB- hmmm , they could have at least changed the name -RRB- email client -LRB- give me a break , when did outlook express come out again -RRB- anyway , you can see that the new mac is only immitating vista so , lets look at vista .
what did microsoft need to do from xp .
they needed to add security -LRB- not like anyone gets viruses anyway , but it 's always good to have -RRB- interphase , and media center .
they delivered .
not only does vista add all those things , but it does so to a spectacular level .
the windows aero is amazing , everything looks so much more alive and fades out and scrolls around .
then , to top that , search is everywhere to be found .
you can make virtual folders , the access of folders is easier .
also , it has built in voice recognition , you can talk to vista .
then , there is a new media center for everyone .
the widgets are also cool , i did n't know if i 'd like them , but i use them everyday and they are really useful .
microsoft upgraded security with windows defender look , windows vista is the future of os , it is where the os is going .
mac is already copying them -LRB- by the way , when is mac going to show some class in their advertisements , if windows suck so bad , then why do 85 % of all compuer users go microsoft , hmmmm -RRB- in short , windows vista is a fabulous os , the only very slight problem is that one driver to a program that i did not even use is not compatable , and it kept reminding me until i deleted it .
vista is the slickest , most amazing os on the market today , and it is the way to go .
i got to admit its better then xp and any mac osx is for the posers who think they are safe and better then any one else .
windows vista has a storng and needs alot of power , it has a preloading system , i beleive its an ai that tries to map what you do and then preload data before you use it , but it needs alot of ram to do this so for games you need to wait till 8gb + become more common and patches come out to alow older games to be played .
right now microsoft is trying to push it on the public so they can scrap xp and no longer have to post updates for it any more .
because its a mainstream thing im sure mac lovers will curse it out like they normaly do , and say it is full of security holes .
while hiding the fact that macs have more secuity problems but the simple fact is no one cares about the small minority that use it .
its like their advertizing campain which i find annoying since pcs years ago might have been built for spread sheet and word prossesing but now are better then mac at video , audio operations , because of advancements that allows pcs to have more computational power to play with .
i would say in 6 months to a year vista will more main stream .
overall , i think this operating system is good for anyone with an already powerful computer .
you should not attempt an installation on a weaker one because it will be ridiculously slow .
it does improve upon the speed of xp and it does have a very sexy interface .
however , the little windows asking you to allow executables to run or not and the firewall can be quite annoying .
but again , overall , you get a lot of bang for your buck on this one .
good job , gates .
i have been using vista since the first beta release and over the last year or so have come to love it .
i do not agree that it 's simply xp warmed over .
your editor has not used it enough to make that judgment .
it goes beyond xp in subtle and not so subtle ways .
it simply feels different .
it will dawn on the user at some point , hey , this thing is well thought out .
sure , it 's a work in progress , but tell me anything of significance that is not .
i say , be positive about vista and you will be rewarded with a deeply satisfying computing experience .
first of all , i think cnet needs to eliminate all reviews of this product that were posted prior to the january 30th launch date , or verify that those who have reviewed this product were in the beta testing program , like myself i have been using vista since beta 2 with no crashes , never had to install one driver after install on my custom built machine , and i even have it running on two notebooks with no problems whatsoever .
this is microsoft 's best os to date , despite it missing some features .
call me a fanboy if you need to , but windows posses more future than opensource or macos .
how many games can macos play or even linux .
next to none .
this may not be the ` advanced ' operating system people were looking for , but it does exactly what it says .
best os ever , but i would wait till i needed a new computer to get this os .
i 'm rulling vista ultimate on a p4 3 .
6ghz/3gb ram , and it 's great what more can i say except that although many people consider it an xp upgrade .
it way mre than that when you 're doing a lot of video editing as well as gaming without any issues you 're a happy camper that i am willo .
ok , for all you noob vista haters , that bs that you talk about with the vista installation crashes , why did you even buy vista then , the only time vista crashes is if you have a garbage pc and you know you should not have bought it , vista is good , i run it in classic graphics though because i dont like pretty , but i really dont care if it has pretty or not , i can handle like 250 megs taking up my hd , it doesnt bother me , it 's interface is much more of ease and it 's fit for a noob to follow , vista is faster than xp if you disable aero too .
but seriously that guy that rated it a 1 and said all that bs , you are a n00b if you have a crappy comp , do not try to make people not buy vista just cause you made up all that garbage .
i have 1 con that i really hate about 1 version of vista though , home basic this is the biggest computer os ripoff i have ever seen .
i dont recommend it to anyone .
but thats it , just wait for some more updates to vista and youll see what will happen , m $ will own apple , with all due respect to os x 10 .
5 leapord because i havent tried it yet , this owns mac os x period .
i ran out and bought the ultimate edition of vista yesterday .
it 's far more a better os than xp .
xp is also a fine os but everything needs to be tuned up every few years .
i do n't agree with mr vermosi 's saying it 's just a warm over of xp .
it 's way more than that .
if you like faster performance , better file management and support among other things than try it .
you wo n't be dissapointed .
vista also lets you connect more different types of hardware and also manages it better .
the increased security hassles i have been reading about will all fall into place and become easier for the user as he/she gets used to them .
if you do not , microsoft gave you the option to turn them off , although if you think the hassle of cleaning your hard drive of viruses and other harmful stuff is easier than leaving the security on then go for it .
vista -LRB- no matter what version -RRB- is a great os and microsoft put alot of time into it .
try it and if you disagree then uninstall it and i will buy your copy .
my e mail is ryster1@si .
com .
thats how sure i am of how you will like it .
well after looking at the operating system one can clearly say that it does not deserve a 1 on a scale of 10 .
so all those people giving it a 1 are just not being fair or truthful .
i really liked the new look and feel .
also the new features that are added and very good .
all that i want to say is i remember not wanting to switch from win 95 to 98 but later i is reall glad i upgraded .
same thing happened with 98/me to win xp .
evertime i upgraded to the newer version , after some time i is really glad i did and that is exactly what i want to tell everyone .
go for it guys and see for yourself .
do not listen to what other say go see for yourself at any store .
see it , feel it and am sure you will definately buy it .
i see a lot of reviews talking vista is just like xp .
ever since i installed vista it is more then 3 months -LRB- beta testing -RRB- .
i 'm unable to switch back to xp .
mainly the look and feel the fonts are very clear , it gives a very rich interface .
the video quality is amazing .
i love the snipit tool it is a great value add .
they are many small small gadgets which makes the life very easier go for it .
i know for sure there is one genre of ppl who are dying to get this os and they are the .
net software engineers .
the next generation .
net api is dependent on vista and the prospects are mindblowing .
consider browsing all websites in 3d version completely on the fly .
all the graphs will be in 3d and that itself will be a boon for stock analysts , doctors , scientists , et al .
and all this will be possible because of the xaml tech thats available only thru vista .
s/w companies will start upgrading their desktop and web based applications to xaml .
then the end users like you will be blown away with the advancements .
the macs will become passe ' people at microsoft havent been sitting on their all these years .
they have developed some state of the art software frameworks like the .
net2 .
0 framework no other framework even come close to it .
the possibilities are endless .
like i said only software engineers like me would appreciate vista and its hidden powers wait and see .
i have been running ` vista on two different machines since mid october .
the first is an old 1 ghz -LRB- 512 -RRB- compaq micro e dvd/rw , the other is a u build d 945 3 .
4 ghz -LRB- 1g -RRB- with floppy , card reader , cd/rw , dvd/rw and dvd/rw/lightscribe .
the first set up just did n't have the teeth needed to chew on the big bytes that i is trying to feed it it still ran the basics well on the other hand the second unit is wow .
-LRB- thankyou ` foxconn ' and ` nvidia ' for the drivers -RRB- .
it is amazing to me that i can download two seperate programs at the same time , install them at the same time and then run both of them at the same time .
in the three months that i have been using ultimate , i have not experienced a ` crash ' .
i have had some minor shakes due to bcak errors but nothing that i could n't immediately recover from the resource usage that seems to be of great concern to so many has rarely exceeded 50 % of the total available -LRB- on both systems -RRB- .
i am able to monitor this on the cpu/memory gadget that comes with ` sidebar ' .
` ready boost ' is a cheap and easy way to add a gig or two of memory .
the simple reality is the more the resources the more the out put .
one of the many great features of vista ' is the ability to run in the background while i 'm working .
for example tune up , -LRB- de frag , virus scan , auto backup -LRB- comes with ` one care ' -RRB- -RRB- , will pause when i 'm using the resources and then pick up where it left off when the computer has been idle for a short time .
once set up -LRB- two minutes -RRB- i never have to worry about these chores again .
pretty good use of resources , do n't ya think .
now here 's the up side of the down side .
no there is not much software available yet ; but , here 's the way i see it .
the companies that are ` progressive ' and ` leading edge ' have already issued some updates these are the people that i want to deal with the others .
finally , the uac 's are there to keep people like me from ` accidently ' downloading stuff that i do not want tying up my ` resources ' .
it took me a couple of hours to get used to the pop ups , but as i got my system running the way i wanted , there were less and less of them .
mom 's will love them because they are part of what i call the net safe system .
-LRB- mom not only can you control when they 're on , you can control what they 're on .
yes there may be some limitations due to being new , but is not that where the fun is .
think of the possibilities .
uh oh this looks like another cnet review written by steve jobs .
honestly cnet , is this a joke .
search is buried .
it takes one click .
unless you lay a search box right on the desktop , that 's as good as it gets .
there 's too much upgraded stuff .
last time i checked , that is a good thing here 's the scoop cnet is absurdly biased toward apple .
every time apple releases a 10 .
x update for $ 129 , cnet says that it 's the greatest thing ever and will change the way you use your computer heck , it will change your life .
when microsoft releases a total overhaul of its os that will , in fact , change the way you use your computer , cnet yawns .
apple spits out new html e mail templates amazing .
microsoft produces the most beautiful , secure , and powerful version of windows ever ho hum here 's the real deal vista is not perfect , but it 's downright awesome .
the hardware requirements are not as significant as you think -LRB- my $ 500 computer runs it flawlessly -RRB- , and there is 99 % driver support right out of the box .
yes , there are a lot of versions , but home premium is the standard for 95 % of consumers .
i currently dual boot xp and vista .
i use vista most of the time , and it honestly hurts when i go back to xp .
i just miss all the little things that vista does so well .
that 's the biggest reason to get vista once you 've used it , it 's so hard to use anything else .
bottom line there 's no reason not to get it .
purposely running this on a barely vista capable computer with on board video currently , and it 's still impressive in many ways .
along with office 2007 and the access to tools with the new ribbon features , there is much good in this new version my productivity took a giant leap with this combination , even though i do n't have the aeroglass and access to some of the high end features -LRB- the way you can scroll through applications -RRB- , largely due to this self imposed video lameness now , the dark side of vista , occasionally hangs or chugs along and wo not let you know what 's up , and for the inner geek , i want to know what 's going on .
why can not i get on with what i is trying to do .
fortunately , i expect most of these bottlenecks to be resolved in a new system with better hardware , and do note that a dual core or very fast single hyperthreading processor is needed , as is a pile of memory -LRB- please get at least 2gb for serious vista -RRB- and a video board with at least 128mb , the more the better again , especially if you like great graphics with all of the new usb flash drives appearing , one of my favorite new features is that you can walk up to any vista machine -LRB- setup allowing -RRB- , plug in your compatible drive , and lo and behold , instant improvement in performance under the hood , so much has been redesigned and setup for next generation programming models and hardware that a direct comparison to anything xp other than keeping a similar look and feel is baloney you may love or hate microsoft , but they sure have a crew of folks that do one hell of a job , regardless of your preferences .
i have looked at many other office suites , and i get the most productivity out of microsoft most of the time , except perhaps for best of class programs like high end cad or scientific software note to c net if you take sole property of my statements , you can have sole responsibility for the contents , that legal eze offends me , but , as a socan member , it is already copyrighted when i wrote it .
use it or not , but if you do , give me credit for writing it .
if i uttered a profundity that appeals to you that you wish to use elsewhere , i am honored .
being a geek from way back having started writing code in the 4th grade , you 'd expect me to burst with excitement no matter microsoft is releasing however this is not true being very accustomed to my windowsnt being separated from the riff raff associated with windows95 i is more than let down with windowsxp .
while this hybrid of technologies gained acceptance on desktops throughout the land , my boxed version is installed , removed that day , and left gathering dust until quite literally about 1 2 years ago .
my windows2000 is working fast , stable , and lacked the romper room of windowsxp 's 95ishness about 3 weeks ago i acquired windows vista out of boredom , and tried it on my most recent upgrade to a core2 duo intel processor coupled with a $ 98 .
00 geforce video card displacing my embattled gvx1 3d labs professional opengl accelerator the install .
exceptionally boring -LRB- but are n't they all though . -RRB-
, but no hang ups , no crashes , and i is running a dual boot with my native windowsxp the drivers .
all seemed to download as needed , or be present in the vista version i attained .
no head aches the install time .
meh not too bad actually .
i will admit i multitasked myself by watching a movie in the other room while the install chugged away , but maybe an hour or so the first boot .
woaaah .
pure excitement .
it looked like my interior designing girlfriend got together with the microsoft propeller heads , and created something aesthetically pleasing while functional a first .
call it a warmed over version of windowsxp as others have , but then that would be ignoring the fact it represents a total re write meaning its 100 % all new .
so that statement falls more than short of it 's claim i wo n't verbally parse the features as you all can do that on your own .
i will say it is a pleasure to work with .
the excitement i had hoped for when i plunked down $ 300 .
00 for windowsxp professional had long gone undelivered until now finally .
microsoft delivers excitement in a box .
the next step is for microsoft to graciously send me a copy .
ok , maybe i 'm aiming high .
perhaps a bestbuy software run will be more realistic my advice .
if you 're pc is old , upgrade it .
it does not take much these days , and the prices are great .
i personally have been used to working with quad processor workstations since 1995 , but have somehow managed to maintain an old dell pentiumiii 733mhz at home since 2000 -LRB- very old to today 's standards -RRB- enjoy .
running 64 bit vista ultimate for 2 months .
no problems with dimension e521 with 1gb ram and 256mb nividia graphics card .
only avg offers 64 bit anti virus .
only problems encountered were voip software and drivers for usb phones do not upgrade your system to vista capable , buy or build new .
vista ultimate is a good value if you have and need 64 bit computing .
networking features also an a + + .
this latest version of windows is the single best ever released from ms all negative views from the general public -LRB- before it 's actually released -RRB- are causing a great deal of confusion most posts on this website are that of incomplete versions , trial and/or beta versions .
there is over a 200 % improvment in the product since it 's beta releases most people -LRB- mainly children -RRB- posting in reply to this product have an invalid view .
they have no experience with the product , are posting their friends opinion , or simply have no general idea of the concept , product or actual use at all the reviewers verdict on this product is also pathetic .
the stark lack of any specific information provided by the cnet reviewer is also yet another downfall .
in recent times , this specific site , it 's reviewers and of course it 's ever so well educated voting public lack any merit what so ever it truely is pathetic .
but , never the less this product will dominate all new pc sales , and regardless of what everybody says you will use it .
just like you never upgraded to xp because it is such a resource hog sigh .
i have had a chance to use vista ultimate for about 2 months now .
at first i is not sure what to think .
after giving it a chance , it blows away xp by far having a family with young children , the parental controls come in very handy with .
even businesses can use the parental controls to keep employee in check the search features are great .
i once created a document for work but forgot what i fully named it .
from the start button , i could just type in just a few letters and i is able to see the document .
that saved me time also , with all the news about laptops with data being stolen , there is a nice new feature called bit locker .
as a business man , my clients information is very important to me .
i use bitlocker on my laptop as a safty feature to keep my records safe .
this would also be great for people with personal data on laptops last but not least , the glass effect .
windows aero makes using vista more fun .
granted you do have to have a decent video card .
i enjoy being able to see previews of the different items i have open on my task bar before clicking on it .
sometimes i have several things open .
cnet 's review is really biased .
they can not possibly say that search is buried it 's just one click away .
yes , you click on the start menu and start typing .
you do n't even have to press enter .
can it be possibly easier .
what do they want , a zero click search .
if that were the case , the only thing the computer would do is searching things .
that 's so stupid it invalidates the whole review in my experience , vista is full of good features , simpler to use than xp , so far it 's way more secure -LRB- zero incidents in three months , not running an antivirus or any other security software -RRB- and with plenty of functionality .
do not like office 2007 all that much , but that 's another review .
this is definately a good time to buy a computer or upgrade your existing pc to vista .
i 've been using it for awhile now and it is one of the most stable systems i 've ever used .
take a second look and use it day to day and you quickly realize just how powerful it is .
some of the things i love , media center , integrated search , hd video editing , new interface changes .
there are so many positive things under the hood that many people will never know is there .
things that can be annoying .
uac can initially be a small pest but it is needed , and after you do your initial software installs , you rarely see it .
do not believe all the fud people submit here , try it yourself .
my friends and family love it too .

tell me something that this os cant do that the apple os x can .
cnet needs to get off the mac band wagon already .
7 versions of xp -LRB- i believe -RRB- so now 9 for vista is too much .
its a great os , no theres no classic view , some folks can ; t handle change .
windows vista is great and worth buying , just not for the price tag .
if it is lowered around 15 20 % , it would be worth it but right now , just coming into the market , i do not think that it is worth it games have so much more support now and microsoft is finally paying attention to gamers .
also , directx 10 is a big hit with consumers as well as manufactures with all of the editions , it is hard to regular customers to decide .
but for all of the techs out there , it shouldn t be a problem .
i personally like the 6 edition idea as of right now , not worth the money .
wait 6 months for updates and the price tag to go down and then go out and buy an awesome , microsoft operating system .
i deployed vista ultimate around nov 10th 2006 with no problems under small business server 2003 r2 , with isa .
do n't know anything about osx and do not care to .
i have used a test computer on the internet not on a domain , with no virus software installed , just microsoft defender , for two month .
i spent almost the entire time on the grayside of the internet testing .
after two month i installed avg , onecar to test the computer and not one virus or malware is detected on the computer .
when i use xp sp2 for several days i have plenty spyware and viruses on the computer that are detected with onecare and avg .
the average user does not keep virus and spyware up to date so vista is a must for endusers .
the graphics features in vista are much nicer than xp may be it is time for something new .
the price is a problem but five years + to develop it could have been more .
if you have xp already the update is much cheaper , and if you are building a new computer install xp and upgrade .
if you spend any time on the web then by now you 've seen many articles disparaging vista for various reasons .
however , vista is a significant update to the windows line .
not only is the core os upgraded for security and modularity , it also includes a completely redesigned network stack and a new audio stack that is second to none in terms of the ability to record and listen to high quality audio .
in addition , vista comes in several variations depending on your needs .
if you need a basic good os there 's a cheap version for you .
if you 're interested in bells and whistles galore there 's the ultimate addition .
vista is compatible with current and past hardware .
i 'm running it on a two year old dell laptop with a pentium m processor and it is very quick .
startup and shutdown have been sped up significantly .
vista also includes a new search function which revolutionizes the way you interact with the os .
no longer are you forced to click through the menus in control panel searching for the button to turn on bigger font .
now you can just search for font and the results are instantly displayed .
also , the search function changes the way you open programs .
rather than picking your way through the start menu you can just type the name of the program into the search bar in the start menu -LRB- just hit windows key and start typing -RRB- and start it immediately .
also , for even speedier program running you can add it to the quick launch bar .
you can then hit windows + any number where the number represents that program 's position on the quick launch bar and it 'll start .
the new explorer behaves similarly .
you can find any file almost instantaneously simply by searching for it in the search box in the file explorer .
gone are the days of the slow xp search ; vista searches are nearly immediate .
explorer contains many ways to sort your data including a new stack feature which will create virtual folders on the fly wherein you can find all the files meeting any criteria of your choice which can include size , date created , date edited , author , and even the exif data on your digital photos and many more .
vista comes with many handy programs such as a very good calendar , a mail program which compares favorably to the likes of thunderbird and evolution , very robust backup utilities , a photo gallery program similar to google 's excellent picasa , and depending on the level you buy perhaps many other bells and whistles .
if you take one thing from this review it 's that you should not believe the fud about vista .
there is an excellent wikipedia page describing the new features in vista .
with vista you will interact with your computer in a completely different way .
you will work faster and more efficiently and you will play harder .
there is no doubt in my mind that cnet 's review is wrong on many levels windows photo gallery is an excellent app and it is exclusive to vista .
windows vista media center is superior to xp 's and it doesnt require a special edition to get it just get ultimate .
sidebar might be backported , but right now its also vista exclusive software aside , the general opinion of vista is that its a prettier xp .
you just could not be more wrong .
integrated search seperates vista from xp on so many levels so you have to click the orb or press the windows key on your keyboard .
so what .
even with a desktop search program it takes one click to get in it at the end of the day vista 's stability and improved interface warrents a +1 on xp 's score in my book 7 .
what a joke .
it is very cool but is very pricey .
i dislike vista , and am sticking with xp .
however , keep in mind xp is slated for end of life in july 2009 .
so , i have saved myself the headaches and have moved to fedora 10 linux .
i am taking this path so that i 'm better off for the future .
now i can be free of all of the windows faults -LRB- compatibility , cost , maintenance headaches , etc -RRB- .
i have been in the it industry for over 12 years , and this is my choice .
i have seen the good , the bad , and the ugly .
and vista is ugly to me , linux is friendly and i have been using it for over a year am extremely happy now .
i 've even written my own article of reasons why linux should be considered for any sort of migration .

i 've waited awhile to write a vista review , simply because i do n't think reviewing any os at or around release is going to be either accurate or fair .
after using vista for a few years and then recently switching to 64 bit , i think it 's time installation .
installing vista is a breeze , although it can be a painfully slow breeze .
as of today , once vista finished installing -LRB- a roughly 45 minute progress -RRB- , vista will then begin downloading 77 updates .
the updates take longer to install the the os itself , something of a huge disappointment .
after multiple updates , installs , and reboots , you 'll be completely up to date with vista and ready to have some fun .
at this tiem i can say that 64 bit windows is the way to go on most modern pcs .
all of my old programs that were only available as x86 installs now work flawlessly , and the 64 bit versions work flawlessly as well .
replacing all of my device specific drivers -LRB- printer , g15 , g9 etc . -RRB-
is a bit of a hassle , but in the end works fine .
i is hoping vista , 32 or 64 , would take some of the leg work out of driver hunting , but sadly that is not the case performance .
for the record i 'm running a q600 @ stock speeds of 2 .
4ghz , 6gb of dddr2 800 -LRB- not the fastest i know but my mobo is dated -RRB- , and vista installed on a raptor .
i have to say that performance is pretty zippy .
i can run dx10 games at max setting while burning a dvd and performing downloads in the background with no performance hit on the game -LRB- specifically fall out 3 and bioshock -RRB- .
this is something that would have caused an instant crash on my old xp installation .
speaking of crashes , i have n't had one yet .
the only time my pc shuts down/restarts unexpectedly is when i have a power outage , and as hard as i try i can not blame that on ms .
overall i 'm extremely pleased with the speed and stability of vista 64 changes .
there have been quite a few changes with vista , many of them cosmetic or organizational in nature .
many menus have been switched around so it took a little time when i first installed vista to learn where many of the common tasks had gone .
visually vista is definitely an upgrade , and some of the new security features are nice , but overall these upgrades do n't really feel like a generational step forward .
the one thing that i really do appreciate though is the ease of installing language packs .
installing and managing multiple languages is now much easier than ever , thanks to each pack being available through windows update .
that is a smart move .
the games folder is also sort of useful , as it helps cut down on desktop clutter by grouping all game installs together is it worth the upgrade .
actually i 'm going to have to say no , it is not .
as nice as some of the new user account and security features are -LRB- which are only really helpful to keep kids and pc illiterate people from jagging your pc -RRB- , vista simply does n't offer enough compelling reasons to upgrade .
if i 'm being completely honest , the only real reason to go with vista , aside from it 's improved stability -LRB- arguable -RRB- , is to play dx10 games .
ms likes to tout how easy it is to use vista , which it is for anyone who 's used windows for their entire life , e .
me final .
while i can not with a good conscience tell anyone out there that an upgrade is necessary , i do still find myself in love with vista .
the visual style , dx10 support , a rock solid 64 bit install , flexible and intuitive language management , and overall pleasing design are what do it for me .
going to back to xp does feel like a step backwards to me , but for no quantifiable reason .
i think that feeling comes from the fact that a lot of older pcs run xp , so when i see the xp logo at startup i instantly prepare myself for some less than stellar computing .
to be fair it 's the hardware , not the os to blame , but an xp install is a pretty good warning sign that you 're about to be using a slow piece of computer .
the bottom line is that i like vista and it works for me , and i do not plan on messing with that formula anytime soon .
i like this version of vista because of the extra features it adds .
it would not be enough to make me upgrade from premium to ultimate though .
in my opinion vista ultimate is a great upgrade from xp , i have had no problems so far apart from some thingd not respondng and everything is very easy to find around .
i currently use windows vista home basic at work and windows xp home , xp professional , and vista ultimate at home .
right out of the box , windows vista ultimate is quite a dissapointing after few hours of use .
system restore used up too much hard drive in few days so i had to turn that off -LRB- i is like wth .
how did this happen . -RRB-
, and user alert windows really annoyed me so much that i also turned that off .
it is just so horrible right out of the box that i even thought of degrading back to xp .
however , i configured the system to get rid of obsolete stuff in vista for faster performance .
it does n't work quite as fast , but it 's still satisfying enough to run it smoothly .
also , after knowing that microsoft 's future operating systems , windows 7 -LRB- vienna -RRB- and windows 8 -LRB- midori -RRB- , would not support backward compatibility like steve jobs did when making transition from os 9 to os x -LRB- well , situation is little bit different if you take a look at their market share ; mac os is and is still minority in the market share so people did not care much at that time .
but microsoft owns majority of the market , and they are considering major switch which would hugely affect market share . -RRB-
so i decided to stick with vista .
vista might be the last operating system to support backward compatibility for old softwares -LRB- xp should now be considered as old gen -RRB- .
it mighty be a great approach among software makers , but risky choice in consumer 's perspective .
i 'll just play safe and stick with vista for long time .
you should do a clean install by booting and keep all your devices -LRB- webcam , wireless keyboard -RRB- plugged in .
vista ultimate looks spectacular but has some problems with the drivers and some of the programs .
i suggest not to install vista if you use deaemon tools or any image mounting software .
it had a problem for me no drive letters i can not mount images .
anyway , vista is good looking and i eagerly await windows 7 .
8 out of ten .
1 for hardware .
1 for software .
+10 for looking and functionality .
just like how xp is rather unstable when it is released , so is vista .
i think we should all stop criticizing and wait until microsoft releases a few more sps .
it 's very stable and usable .
it 's fast on a suitable computer , and very responsive , and used to crash only before i installed all the available updates now it 's great .
vista makes much better use of your ram , realizing that unused ram is wasted ram .
prefetch works very well , launching all applications noticably faster than xp .
dx10 makes vista worth buying all by itself , games look incredibly good under it .
the instant search in the start menu is a big plus as well as the full hard drive image backup .
i can restore my entire computer in approximatly 1 and 1/2 hours , all games and applications as well as settings .
this is well over 100gigs of information .
i am running the 64 bit edition of ultimate , and i have not had a single problem with any of my games , old or new .
much more stable and faster than the x64 xp one thing i do not get , is why would cnet say this is not the osx killer .
since when have macintosh users ever made up any kind of substantial userbase anyway .
i 'm not saying a little competition from another os company would not be good for windows users , i 'm just saying that there is not any competition out right now .
at all .
mac expensive proprietary hardware and software , no games to speak of , only good for video and sound editing -LRB- made for the computer illiterate anyway -RRB- .
linux gaming does not exists except for the 3 opengl games on the market , not userfriendly , for masochistic users only .
while i believe that my computer would run a tad bit faster using windows xp dare i say i like windows vista .
a lot .
i is adamantly opposed to vista when it first came out .
i recently purchased a new notebook though , so it came standard i thought i might as well get the ultimate edition if i had to use this dreaded operating system it is no os x , but i really like vista .
it feels like a glamorized version of xp .
a little matured , and not without flaws i like all the features that the ultimate edition offers .
i feel like everything is well organized in this edition , and easy to access .
i really do not understand what all the complaints have been about perhaps by now , microsoft has worked out a lot of the kinks that users complained about when the os is first release all that being said , the specs on my system are pretty high end .
that could contribute to the operating systems performance just thought i should show that vista is not all bad .
a caution to anyone reading these reviews most of the reviews on this site are from those who do not actually own the system and merely like to see their screenname up on a website the overall experience of vista is nice , with easier permissions management and great support .
it 's much more secure than xp and i would say far more stable , i have not yet had any problem with it -LRB- far from what can be said for my xp machine -RRB- i have nothing to complain of .
others ' complaints seem to either have no basis or to be based on a lack of vista drivers or compatability for old hardware and software , most of which can be corrected with a quick online download .
i can see nothing wrong with this system and hope the vista bashing happy lunatics who have previously written such abysmal reviews as to bring its consumer rating so low will get a face full of it with sp1 .
i think that vista is an excillent os .
i know that it took 5 years for microsoft to develop this os .
honestly i think they were doing sonething else -LRB- hint hint windows 7 -RRB- during that time .
i think they threw this together just to please the croud because they were getting a little anxious .
i do not blaim them either .
i purchased and installed vista ultimate as soon as it is released , and like most people i had some driver compatibility issues to start with , but in the months following this , vista drivers were released that addressed my problems .
this together with updates from ms has vista working very well for me .
a little while back i re installed xp from my backup drive for a few days -LRB- out of nostalgia -RRB- and explorer is crashing , the ` end program ' dialog popped up when shutting down .
i also thought it looked and felt old , so i promptly re installed vista .
vista should be reviewed by people who actually know how to use it .
people who took the time to figure out how it operates .
people who actually know how to use a computer .
instead of a bunch of backwoods xp billies that can not give up an old outdated os going on it 's 3rd service pack .
the graphics and effects are outstanding .
ms did a great job putting this os together with such few bugs .
of course depending on your previous system configuration upgrades/updates/hot fixes are needed ; however , i have not had too many problems that can not be resolved .
norton is 2006 is a big issue , but i switched to kaspersky .
installed all updates and only have one major problem .
nvidia keeps saying that my 7600gt is compatible and that they have fixed all the problems ; however , when i play games -LRB- even new ones -RRB- i have distortion problems .
this is fixed by restarting the computer but presents itself after closing the game and reopening .
have a few dll problems when playing mpegs in wmp , but nothing limits playback runs amazingly fast , but i can not wait till sp1 user .
high tech level .

i really can not stand when the linux and/or mac crowd flocks to message boards and reviews to trash ms products .
they are armed with the really annoying m $ signs and such .
it always detracts from the consumer experience when you make up reviews based on your hate of a company vista is a nice os loaded with features .
i have used it for a year since the business release in nov .
i have found it to be stable for personal use and software development .
i would not upgrade unless you are one that must have the latest .
it does not do much more for you than xp .
however , i would not avoid it if you are looking for a new computer .
it does use more resources than xp but not as much as the ms hater crowd would have you believe .
i bought a laptop about 6 months ago and it had vista pre loaded .
at first i is frustrated by the fact that it ran so slow .
opening ie is almost like being on dial up .
then i added more ram .
the laptop had 512 i put another 1 gig into it .
after the ram update it seem to run ok .
i just purchased a toshiba laptop with 2 gigs of ram .
it has vista pre loaded .
2 gigs should really be the minimum requirements .
vista runs great , i really have not had any problems with it -LRB- knock on wood -RRB- .
i is frustrated by vista wanting to check with me through a popup that it is ok to run a program or install something .
you can turn this off under the control panel/users .
i have read a lot of people writing in and saying how much they hate vista , but i do remember when xp is released everyone basically said the same thing .
the bottom line is you need a fast machine to run vista .
if you have an old computer don t waste your time installing it if you purchase a new computer and it has a gig of ram or less , you better fit the cost of more ram into the budget .
as with all new operating systems , vista did have some kind of a hitch in the beginning .
yes , before msoft 's patches , it is glitchy , did crash a bit , and had a lack of drivers this is to be expected with all of msoft 's operating systems .
however , after waiting 8 months or so since vista 's release to install it , i must say the wait is worth it .
of course , mainly the marketing ploys attracted me dx10 , halo 2 -LRB- which sucked for the most part , by the way . -RRB-
and of course the shiny shiny .
that put aside , my games do load faster , although there 's a slight drop in fps -LRB- 2 3 fps -RRB- .
the system runs fine on my amd 64 x2 3800 + 2 .
0ghz 2gb ddr333 ram , 8600gts .
you do n't need a stellar pc to run vista , but if it 's below the recommended requirements or barely touches the minimum , please do not install it and review it you 're giving it a bad name .
no , i 'm not a msoft fanboy , nor am i a mac fanboy i 'm not particular in that aspect drivers are more commonplace now ; if you have something that does not support vista inside your computer at this time , you would generally need to update it -LRB- an ati radeon 9200 should not be in your computer , for example things would just lag to no end , due to the somewhat high graphics requirements , not to mention the card 's just ancient -RRB- .
updates are for the most part cumulative though i 'd definitely say the $ 380 price tag is not worth it .
either a -RRB- wait for the price to lower -LRB- it probably will with sp1 -RRB- or b -RRB- stick with xp .
i bought the ultimate version for my laptop and have been pleasantly surprised .
i started with a clean install on my dell 1705 and is delighted when vista proactively downloaded the correct drivers -LRB- or enabled them -RRB- for virtually everything i threw at it .
i is also pleansantly surprised to find out that all of my applications worked flawlessly when i reinstalled them .
i have windows mce 2005 installed on my desktop and have had far fewer glitches with vista .
the media center application within vista is also an improvement over the mce 2005 version .
all in all i am happy with it except the price -LRB- even with my company 's discounted rate -RRB- .
after running vista for the last three months i 've actually been surprisingly happy with my experience .
though there where a few growing pains as i waited for some of my apps to be updated the operating system itself works well .
i particularly like the search and the new tools for handling pictures , dvd 's and video windows mail is still exactly like outlook express meaning it 's annoying and ugly , and the new windows calendar is a blatent rip off of ical .
they are both functional but nothing extraordinary the new interface is interesting , but it 's still just windows .
i still have not assertained the purpose of the glass theme as it may actually take away from the usability .
as well the classic windows start menu , taskbar , tray interface is still around and still just as clunky as useless as ever ms needs to steal a page from os x and re think their launcher overall i 'd say vista is a natural evolution of xp and a good operating system .
it 's gotten a harsh review by most users and actually has a lot of compelling features , though none of them justify the cost of the upgrade .
unless you 're descperate for search or work with a lot of media , then safe your money for a new computer fast enough to run vista well .
all i can say is that you 'll just have to wait for vista .
doesnt matter if they copied apple , what difference would that make to a consumer .
also the same thing happened with xp , just wait and it 'll all be alright , and windows will be king again -LRB- although they always have been -RRB- .
first off , buy the oem version .
assuming you had to upgrade your system , you 're probably keeping the mobo for a while so why not save the money for the same product i upgraded the motherboard , processor , and memory at the same time i upgraded from xp media center to vista ultimate and it worked like a charm .
do yourself a favor and install in a clean partition highly recommend an upgrade to at least a core 2 duo and 2 gigs of mem to get the full effect .
plus a geforce 7700 or higher does not hurt either so far , security is getting rave reviews from the likes of steve gibson microsoft is finally getting it .
just installed it and i can not wait to get under the hood and start tweaking .
i installed vista ultimate on xp pro without any problems , except some drives i had to download .
the installation is smooth and without any glitches .
there are many new features i will use and microsoft mad a leap frog with this version .
however , there are programs i had to remove and wait until a vista version is out .
there is a great wealth of media programs in this version and it will take vista one step forward as a top operation system .
this is what all the apple fanbois would have people believe get real every os has issues regardless of the vendor .
this religious war is so old it has dust for bones .
the only reason you see more about msft problems is because is has over 85 % of the worldwide market share .
more nodes more exposure if apple had that share you would see the same vitriol posted the other way vista is a good os and with the right machine runs very well .
if you do not have the ability to get a pc with more horsepower then stay on xp if you are on a mac , why are you here .
first impressions .
vista installs like a dream , even your grandma can do it .
i have yet had it fail to find and install any device on any system including my home monstrosity .
i have installed it on ibm t series laptops , ibm desktops , ibm intelistations , dell latitude series laptops , dell optiplex desktops without issue finding non vista standard install drives is a snap .
no longer are you bound to the floppy drive .
cd , usb memory key , floppy no problem .
now would i go out there and purchase it for an existing system , no .
but it is definitely worthy for your new system os also i have noticed , and several co workers agree , that system performance as good or actually increased compared to xp so far microsoft has done a good job with this os .
we 'll see what issues start popping up now oh and all you wendy winers that are giving it a bad score for one thing grow up .
you 're sorry butt would never have made it out of kindergarten if one thing made it all bad real mature and objective .
is running windows xp pro x64 edition .
purchased the full copy so i do not loose my previous license .
i purchased windows vista ultimate 64bit purchased on release day installation went very smooth , no problems .
as soon as it is done i ram windows update and it downloaded 145megs of updates over all i is very happy with the user interface and really love windows media center , both are just visually stunning .
i purchased the hauppauge hvr 1600 as it is premium certified for vista and it works wonderfully as an ota hd tuner/capture card the voice command is also very slick .
i spend a little time on it when i can and it gets better and better as it learns how i talk most games that are direct 3d are working great , but no open gl support right now , i guess it is a problem with ati and not windows vista itself .
before i even got to installing games i found that with just media center running , 1gb of ram is just not enough .
i went to the local computer store and upgraded to 3gb of ram and vista loves me .
over all my computer seems very stable .
i have yet to have any system level crashes , but have had a few 3rd party apps crash out on me .
so far , i have never had it happen where vista could not force close the program .
gaming feels like it is about the same speed as it is in xp x64 , but i have seen benchmarks for my very videocard stating that it is about 5 percent slower .
i am missing open gl though , no second life or any quake engine based games ultimate extras is part of the reason that i went with ultimate , so far the one extra texas hold em , delivered through windows update , is not really my kind of game , but i am looking forward to more little extras some downsides .
first off , people are saying , oh you have to have the most powerful computer in the world to run vista .
totally not true , but you do need a fairly fast machine with a minimum of 2gb of ram 3 + seems like a comfortable setup , -LRB- home basic you could get away with much less -RRB- .
also , as of the time of this writing , vista is cutting edge .
if you are unsure about upgrading to vista , i say , do not .
keep xp and use your computer until you need to buy -LRB- or build -RRB- a new one , then upgrade to vista .
software hardware compatibility are a bit low right now , but support gets a little better every day , as software and hardware folks gear up to better support the new os while i would not call it a down side .
most of the options in vista are in different places .
they basically put all the easy stuff up front and buried the more technical stuff .
as someone that does it for a living , i am happy to see this , but it slows me down a little when i am doing my job as i have another layer of menu 's to go through with a few little quarks here and there i am overall very happy with vista and know that my pc computing experience can only get better from here .
despite all it 's criticism a big bravo to microsoft for releasing what looks like a great os over all .
my computer is now my personal high definition pvr and gaming pc note kiteless -LRB- aka jason -RRB- is an avid pc user since 1993 , starting with dos , then windows 3 .

he also dabbled with linux , virtual machines and even owns a cd macbook 2ghz pc specs -LRB- almost 2 years old , w / upgrades -RRB- .

3gb ddr 400mhz ram .
pcie radeon x1900xt 256mb .

1tb total hdd space .
it is a cheap rip off of mac software , but still is good .
vista is a pleasant replacement for xp .
cnet reviewers might do better if they reviewed it without bias .
i doubt they will ever say os x is stable enough for every day use as if something is fundamentally wrong with vista .
if you are curious it is a lot of fun to poke around if you are lazy you will complain about poking around you might have to click twice to search for something .
i found it easy .
i made the mistake of sticking with win 98 and win me until around 2004 because i did not want to deal with the hassle of upgrading , what a mistake .
i installed vista ultimate oem -LRB- $ 188 -RRB- and it is very smooth and guess what , my machine runs better , i think because vista manages networks better than xp home , so my internet connection -LRB- cable modem via netgear router -RRB- is no longer going down 12 times a day .
it 's better out of the box and will only get better as time goes on .
i am running a humble machine , a dimension 5150 with 1 gig of ram and an x600 graphics card , pentium d 2 .
8 giga hertz , xfi sound card .
i will probably upgrade the ram and perhaps the video card , but honestly it is working very smooth and snappy with no glitches , yet i is only rated basic on the cnet vista readiness advisor .
it 's worth it why not enjoy it now for the full life of the product .
windows vista is indeed everything that it is heralded for .
however , what makes windows vista stand out are not the gadgets and windows key + tab scrolling that everyone talks about , but rather the new apis and the graphical engine overhaul .
in the coming years , software targeting windows vista systems -LRB- and heavily upgraded and up to date windows xp systems -RRB- will offer breathtaking new features even in business apps , such as 3d interactivity and highly advanced network interopability .
this is where vista shines .
when the next operating system is released , windows xp will look as obsolete against vista as windows 95 looks to windows xp today , primarily because of the software that runs on it few people realize any of this yet because most people have not seen the amazing stuff third parties are still working hard to produce .
ok , im tired of hearing all of these newbie type users bash vista , its a great os and of course its going to have its share of quirks vista ultimate requires a pretty heavy duty piece of hardware , whether it be a nice laptop or a nice desktop i run vu on my laptop which is a 12 .
1 dell xps with 2gb ram , 70gb 7200rpm drive , 256mb non shared nvidia card etc and it runs very well many things worked during the upgrade/install , somethings didnt work that great but a quick re install and runnign them in compatibility mode seemed to fix the problem all in all i have been running vista ultimate for almost 4 months and im very happy with it and the progress on it so far my printers , things like that work fine still .
i did have some issues with display drivers on my desktop but i actually ran them in xp/sp2 compatiblity mode and they ran on vista fine .
for starters , i could care less if hackers access my computer so i have no reason to complain or think highly of the security features .
believe what you want to believe , but the vista theme looks very nice and it 's really beautiful in motion when it 's running correctly .
i 'm loving how the ignorant people on cnet and teh internet are claiming that vista is just copying the os x .
they can do that if they want .
without microsoft , you would n't have apple because about 10 years ago , they were broke .
idiots .
anyway , the thing that really bothers me is the support for the drivers so far .
the sound drivers work from creative but no very well .
they do n't fully support 5 .
1 speakers , which really is a blow for people that have them .
i is reading somewhere it 's because of the openal they use now instead of directsound .
nice move , microsoft .
you take up 11gb of my hardrive and you can not even emulate the drivers so old things would run .
another thing is the crashing of dll files .
it happens a lot .
if i 'm using sound forge , it starts crashing random drivers and pops up every second asking me what to do with them .
you 're the freakin ' os so why can not you figure out what to do with your own link libraries .
i 'm a gamer and frankly , the games do n't run horrible -LRB- the ones that run -RRB- but they tend to jump a bit more than i 'd like .
now before you guys dig into me , the reason i believe the games do not run that well is because of nvidia .
if you 're getting 35 60 fps anyway , you should not even care .
you 're eyes only see 25 anyway overall , with better drivers and a fix to quit popping up everytime something crashes would be nice .
i have to say i am amazed at how many people say how bad it is when it has not even been released .
it seems to me from the beta version that i got that it has potential that we should see in the next year .
i have a disc being sent to me that should arrive on the 31st that is for the widows vista ultimate and i will see how it works then .
my goal on that day will be crash windows vista .
in the end , this is a great competitor to the mac 's os x operating system .
windows users should not feel the pressure to upgrade now , and if you 're already running xp , just purchase the upgrade version of vista to save a fair amount of cash .
vista is more expensive than os x and linux but also has a lot more media , gaming , and business capabilities than the two os ' combined .
integrated media center in premium and ultimate editions is a major plus the 4 retail versions -LRB- home basic , home premium , ultimate , and business -RRB- might start out a tad confusing , but microsoft has made differences between each pretty clear .
and the prices are all somewhat fair considering the vastness of vista and what it has potential for in the coming years .
ultimate is the obvious choice for gamers and media designers , seeing that it comes with lots of applications and add ons built into the os for people that will take advantage of those apps instead of forcing everyone to purchase 1 version another nice little addition is maintenance .
vista uses monitoring utilities to track performance and compatibility with a large number of programs , drivers , etc .
that might help you make a decision on whether or not it 's a good idea to install specific files to your hard drive .
you can encript your hard drive as well -LRB- if it meets the requirements -RRB- to prevent hackers from stealing your files and personal information file recovery is a thing of beauty .
you can take documents that you screwed up and revert back to previous saves because vista stores those documents with the last 5 saves and allows you to choose which of the last 5 that you saved , hopefully ending for good the holy crap i just saved over my 10 page presentation for tomorrow 's board meeting situations many people think that vista is merely an upgraded xp , but it 's more than that .
unfortunately there 's a couple things that microsoft did not get ready in time for release , but we should see an enhanced file structuring system and more cool features introduced on a sp1 , and i 'm fine with that .
rome was not built in a day , and neither is os x .
the stability , features , and massive media capabilities of vista are worth the cash in the end , and after a sp1 update , i would easily give this a 9 .
5/10 .
but until we see those big improvements that put vista over the top , an 8/10 will do .
EZ transition , intuitive. ; Very hardware demanding .

= twice as fast as xp -LRB- on my 2gb/core2duo system -RRB- .
Everything loads up instantly and has very smooth transistions , gadgets are handy .
Despite it uses up more memory games run just as fast ; no new mouse pointers .
Actually uses your video card !
Indexing integrating into almost everything makes searching WAY faster !
Stability !
DX10 support !
; Requires you have a PC with some power -LRB- which I see as a bit of a PRO -RRB- .
Graphics , responsive , and a list of other great improvements ; Needs high end hardware , and more resources ; though SP 1 does address these issues .
Excellent security , easy to navigate , plenty of options , customization .
very stable !
; a bit fussy with certain software Very fast , seems to take advantage of quad core technology , which XP did n't .
; memory hog out the bum !
using 25 % of 2 gigs idling , games still run very fast though .
Looks great ; stable and reliable ; easily customizable and tweakable ; Will cause legions of overcritical hipsters to bust a nut Complete easy of installation and system intergration ; Shelling Out $ $ $ for a new OS , software incompatibility .
Sleek new graphic designs . .
Easier to use for those who have n't used a PC . .
Better organization . .
More gadgets . .
Better security ; Is a RAM and hard drive hog .
Better colors/interface , integrated search that is one keyboard click away , modified start menu and file management for 64 bit is a plus , bitlocker and improved networking = piece a cake !
; Not quite as polished/udpated as anticipated , but new power is key Stability is excellent , Fast user experience , Reliable , Compatible with most programs ... Love The 64bit editions , and the new Customer Experience Improvement Program -LRB- CEIP -RRB- , and fix itself. ; Constantly having to listen to people bad mouth it , ReadyBoost -LRB- fantastic for those apps which need a little memory boost -RRB- , well thought-out feel , easy to tweak to own needs ; Pricey - one thing the could learn from Mac -LRB- and I do n't opten laud Apple -RRB- would be to allow for multiple HOME site licences to bring down the upgrade cost .
UAC - easy though to turn down Vista is wonderful !
It 's a must-have , especially if you want to take advantage of high-end hardware. ; Ultimate Edition is expensive , not all software is immediately compatible .
everything 3D : internet browsing , graphs , etc. .
Tighter security so that third party applications dont take you for a ride .
The next gen .
NET framework ; The `` Wow . .
starts now '' is misleading .
The popularity will pick up when all desktop appl will be upgraded to vista ... and then the results will be mindblowing !
3D flip and Aero glass effects really make you wan na use your computer ; programs work seamlessly and startup and shutdown times have been reduced , its a MAJOR upgrade .
All items are neatly organized. ; there arent any major flaws , and most will be fixed with Windows Update , Driver support could be better , but no complaints .
The Search funtion is great , Security is Powerfull , Visualy its a giant step up from XP , Quicker Startup , Automatic Updates grab almost every driver needed , Monitoring Tools give tons of info , IE7 ; High Price , User Control pops up way too much and if deactivated stops you from doing anything .
Need lots of RAM and powerfull graphics Utilities are great and very helpful , very fast with the 4 GB of ram I am using. ; None so far , have had it installed for three weeks .
The search bar is in a static place unlike in XP where it took me ages to find . .
Looks as good as mac and works better , .
Faster then XP ; Sometimes programs stop responding .
Very Intuitive , fast , configurable , secure , MCE is superb , Excellent parental controls , Top notch backup utility , Many different versions for added consumer choice , Excellent attention to detail ; Not enough screensavers , No WinFS -LRB- yet -RRB- , Might be a bit of an adjustment for those upgrading from OS X or Win 9x Reliability .
Speed .
Ease of use .
All of these are definitely hallmarks of this operating system .
Great job , Microsoft !
; Its firewall can be annoying and the Windows Defender -LRB- TM -RRB- is really just aggravating , but aside from that it 's awesome .
It Drives Mac users nutz to know that something from MS is superioir ; There is no 400 price tag , by the oem of ultimate for 149 , upgrade xp , then do a clean install . .
it worked for me !
Comes with many new features that allow it to shine over XP . .
Performs excellently on the right computers. ; Uses a bit of hard disk space .
Cool Graphics , Windows Key + Tab is an Ultimate Feature , PC is coming to Living Room and Parental Control is a Great Add , Search is awesome. ; Pricier but Worth it - I recommend buying Ultimate Strong OS , many features ; It has an Evil soul -LRB- evil is not bad just adds texture to the sentence -RRB- that requires a lot of processing power lol Improved security which comes with a price ; visually stunning ; makes good use of contemporary computer equipment , especially multi-core cpu ; ReadyBoost is a real plus , but be sure thumb drive is fast !
; UAC is distracting if necessary part of new OS , although you can turn it off ; it 's the price the user pays in today 's dreadful computer environment .
Best interface yet , currently a lot of drivers available and most games for windows are like native with this OS .
Oh yeah . .
DirectX 10 !
; RAM eater , so do n't install if you have an dinosaur as PC .
Way faster than previous Windows versions and does n't crash.Runs great on the RIGHT HARDWARE. ; Boot up is a little slower than XP.Do not try and upgrade an old PC with Vista .
Plenty of graphical sweets , lots of media utilities/applications in Ultimate Edition , Better Search , Aero Glass , Better Stability than Win XP , Media Center ; 3 home-user versions can potentially lead to confusion , although it 's fairly easy to choose one ; Have to wait for SP1 for the big upgrades , Need a good PC to run Vista more stable , navigation , explorer updates , more secure , Direct X 10 !
, Superfetch , Readyboost , optional user account control , and there are many more features that make vista far superiror to other OS 's ; Had a bumpy start with driver support , but after some tuning everything works great .
A stable , highly evolved Windows OS with wonderful new base APIs , strong security , and a reengineered graphics engine ; Not entirely 100 % backwards compatible for running older Windows software such as 16-bit apps ; new security features can be burdensome to advanced users Speedy on the right box , stable and I have been running since launch .
Tweak-able to your heart 's content . .
Software vendors ca n't fudge as much with this OS. ; Down right dog with the wrong hardware .
Cumbersome to learn , Restore Points will bog you down over time .
An issue allows restore to take as much as 15 % initially then 30 % of the available hdd space . .
software vendors ca n't fudge as much with this OS .
Looks pretty and shiny. ; Way too many to list .
Not only being slow -LRB- I have a 3 year old Pentium 4 computer -RRB- , there are just way too many incompatibilities for me to list .
I am NOT about to go out and buy any new hardware just so I can upgrade to a shiny new face for XP .
You do n't have to be a computer geek to love this OS .
It only recquires someone who knows what s/he 's doing .
it is reliable , fast , and over-all a respectable OS. ; Do n't tweak if you do n't know how to run certain programs plus heavy duty games or some other things designed to rape PCs might be a little too overwhelming for an OS you 're just starting to understand .
This version of windows is good as compared to windows XP , previous versions .
Windows 7 as compared to it is not very good as 7 does not support many much softwares &#38; drivers.Windows Vista ultimate is very good !
; It uses too much system resourses making the system a little bit slower .
Very nice and new interface ; new features were needed and those were added ; games now have more support than ever before ; DirectX 10 ; Fewer crashes ; Not as many restarts for Windows Update ; Windows Vista is a tad bit `` heavy '' ; Some games run slower on Vista than on XP ; price for full retail Compatible with most hardware out there .
Secrity built in from the ground up .
Ease to use .
Beatiful Gui .
Fast and snappy multi-tasking .
Great for gaming !
; The Apple and Linux Trolls who pan it out of hand without so mucha s a try .
What a bunch of closed minds .
Despite cnet 's review , Much more intuitive interface , Much better use of ram , Nice interface without having to install Windowblinds , and DX10 .
Also Ultimate has a full hard drive image backup. ; To many different versions , Ultimate is the best and the only one you should think of buying .
Vista has much better support for dual core , quad core , 64-bit processors , the 64-bit version supports large amounts of RAM -LRB- Ultimate and Business editions support up to 128 GB RAM -RRB- Stable , tons of useful features , MUCH easier to install than XP ; Not recommended for low-end hardware , not immune from bugs , compatibility issues with legacy hardware and peripherals Consists of FULL PC BACKUP , Ultimate Features and is still not any more of a memory hog than the others. ; Unless paying more money for just those few features , there is no reason to upgrade .
very easy to use , very nice looks had no problems at all , and ultimate comes with nice updates and features every moth or so they just added where you can put a video for your desktoop instead of a st ; nothing yet although some people are having trouble finding drivers for there hardware Vista Ultimate is near perfect , Windows 7 should just about be it .
MacOS or Linux is a waste of time and or money for 99 % of us working folks. ; Does n't really support people that want something for free .
People to broke to keep current .
I see people all the time trying to run computer junk from 1992-2002 with XP and Vista .
BeeBee brains .
I built a new pc and I decided to go out on a limb and choose windows vista as my operating system .
Benchmarked speeds faster then windows xp .
Looked a lot better then xp .
startup time is like 20 seconds .
compatible with everything I used. ; Wish i would have bought the 64bit instead of the 32bit .
It does take up about 600mb of RAM but the space it takes is just the applications it expects you to start up .
