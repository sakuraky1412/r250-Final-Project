Pros:. Easy setup, menus are easy to use, very good picture quality, pc hookup is a breeze. 
Cons:. sound quality is decent once hooked up to surround sound system this is fixed. 
Summary:. I looked around alot for what LCD tv I was going to get. All my research pointed me to this little gem. I have liked everything since buying this tv. It has enough hdmi hookups for me. The pc hookup makes it great for watching shows on Hulu. I love watching bluerays on this when i hook up my playstation 3..

Pros:. Easy set up, vivid and bright picture, adequate sound, one of the better menu systems.. 
Cons:. None as of yet.. 
Summary:. Purchased to replace a Samsung 27" HD CRT 3 year old unit for bedroom. We have a 40" Sony XBR in den that we have enjoyed for 3 years but have been impressed with picture quality of the Samsung products. Almost purchased another Sony but in reading reviews of the Samsung LCD, passed on the Sony. We haven't been disappointed. I am hooked up to DirecTV HD on all sets and can say that the picture quality is top notch, even on SD programs. My wife thought I was nuts until she was watching a program in SD on our Sony, came in saw the same program on the Samsung. No comparison. Bright, sharp picture.. Menu system and options on Samsung is one of the best and most intuitive and easy to understand I have used. Right out of the box picture was fine but after tuning up a bit and changing some of settings, it got even better. Vivid, sharp picture quality with deep blacks and accurate color.. Remote is intuitive and easy to use. It may be shiny and show fingerprints, but those of us who have satellite or cable won't use the remote except for some set up. Some reviewers are too critical of the small things.. Some have complained about the sound from the internal speakers. I have a slight hearing loss but for TV speakers, these are adequate and have experienced no issues that others have stated. Sound from the speakers is better than on my Sony. Options are there to tweak settings and I think most that have complaints are being too critical. If I were to use the set in a den for home theater, would hook up to external but for bedroom cannot see why we will do so.. Overall, I am very impressed with the unit and in the future will probably purchase a larger LCD from Samsung to replace my Sony. I have been a Sony buyer for years but Samsung has shown me that they can produce an excellent product that rivals Sony, Panasonic, or LG..

Pros:. EVERYTHING outstandig performance. 
Cons:. It' s not free. 
Summary:. On the review c-net wrote " Surprisingly, HDMI tested far worse. The set didn't handle all of the detail of the source, and edges looked blockier and softer as a result.". this issue appears when you connect a PC un the HDMI port N 1 or N 3, but when you use the HDMI port N 2 the details gets 80% better than the other HDMI ports, however, the PC input has slightly better details. you have to get very very very close to the panel to see the difference, but its a 32" you sholud stand at las 1. m like me to use as aPC monitor.

Pros:. Setup... Price...Colors...Adjustments.... 
Cons:. None as Yet.... 
Summary:. Just a quick summary of my LN32A450. The wife &#38; I were looking for a tv to add to our den. After researching a zillion reviews &#38; in store comparisons, we finally decided on the Samsung LN32A450. Have the tv for 2 weeks now &#38; am very satisfied. The out of box to setup was simple &#38; fast..(mind you that it takes two people to set the tv on the stand....will wall mount before xmas.) Tweaked the tv courtesy from the comments on AVS Forum. Connected to a STB outputting 1080I &#38; the tv handles it extremely well. Watch alot of NHL Hockey &#38; have not seen any motion blur. Tons of adjustments can be done on this tv...Color...Gamma...Sound &#38; Custom Mode, which is a plus. The menu will walk you through all tweaks with ease &#38; an info button will explain what each adjustment is going to render. Have not set up with external speakers as of yet, but the built in bottom speakers are very impresive ( you can adjust the equilizer in the menu). This is our second Samsung (other is a 56" DLP which is 1year old &#38; excellent picture).. Bestbuy had it on sale for 599.00 &#38; a online 10% off with store pickup.... 539.00 plus tax= 609.00. Not to shabby at all. I recommend this tv for its stunning picture &#38; menu adjustments.. Regards....Rick, Montreal.

Pros:. Amazing picture quality. Very sharp picture in video games. Simple menu options. firmware updates. s-video, good for dual moniters. 3 HDMI ports. wide range of video and audio out. High definition ports.good sound. sleek look. amazing. Nice and light. 
Cons:. Nothing to complain about.. 
Summary:. Just bought this tv and set it up 2 days ago. I couldn't be happier.. The picture quality is nice a clear, various modes allow for customization, has HDMI ports for DVD and video game capabilities.. The sound is really good, hidden speakers, audio out for surround sound to hook up home theaters. Come with a headphone jack.. Lots of features and various ports.. This is truly the best tv i've ever bought before. Its nice and light, not too big, clear picture, nice sound, very good clean look to it.. Absolutely a number one buy for people looking for a 32". Even though the price may seem high, it is worth it with everything you get.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality, customization, black levels. 
Cons:. Delay between switching from 720p to 480i. 
Summary:. Absolutely incredible, I bought it 3 weeks ago (upgraded from a 24" Westinghouse HDTV) and could not be happier. This TV is incredible, the only thing I can say about it is that it comes with a stupid 80's-style melody when you turn the TV on and off, but you can turn it off in the menu in about 45 seconds. I had it on component cables with an HD box until last week, when I switched it over to HDMI and WOW! The blacks are as dark as the frame of the set and the color and definition are off the charts. I was waffling between this set and a Sony that was $699 at CC as well, and there's no doubt in my mind that I made the right choice. Seriously, if you're having any doubts about which mid-size LCD to buy, just buy this one. I've always been a Philips and Sony man in the past, but I'm not buying any other brand besides Samsung in the future. My only complaint is that it takes about 2-3 seconds to switch between HD and SD programming, although that seems to be an issue with most HDTVs. It's definitely a 10/10 in my eyes, hope you enjoy it as much as I do!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, features, style. 
Cons:. None in my opinion.. 
Summary:. I've had this TV for a little over one month. I've always been a Sony fan, this time I did a lot of research and found that Samsung has become the number one in LCD sales. I can see why! My advice is, don't even consider Sony or any other brand. Just go buy the Samsung, you won't be dissapointed!. 

$$;
Pros:. amazing clarity and contrast for this price. 
Cons:. no PIP / GAMING. 

$$;
Pros:. The resolution is perfect for a 32 in TV, anything more would be a waste of your money. Works pretty well with Samsung DVD player, only need one remote. Sound is pretty good for standard TV speakers. Design is slick.. 
Cons:. Takes a few seconds to turn on but maybe this is typical for LCD TVs. Picture colors and sound controls for Movie/TV/music etc. are neat but none sound/look perfect IMO.. 
Summary:. All around solid TV in terms of picture, sound, design, and price. It's still new (a few weeks) so I'm hoping that it lasts a while. Paid $650 plus tax at Circuit City for TV and tiny Samsung DVD (can't remember model) and they work very well together. This is an affordable TV size since you don't need a Blue-Ray player unless your a stickler for the extra sound quality (extra resolution won't show on this size screen. Thanks CNET!. Updated. on Feb 3, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the adjustability of picture elements. Everything can be easily fine tuned including colors on both the white and black end of the spectrum. Samsung thought about on screen menus and rear/side panel set up. The best 32" on the market!!. 
Cons:. Stock setting were bad, but easy to adjust. The swivel stand is limited in range. One additional HDMI on the side would be nice, but three fro a 32" is above average.. 
Summary:. I looked and looked. One TV kept pulling me in. Samsung's LN32 A450 is hands down the finest LCD TV on the market.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like almost everything about this t.v. Stunning picture quality, decent sound, user friendly remote, very nice looking set. Farily easy to set up. Plug'n'Play, basically! And not too heavy!. 
Cons:. No picture in picture. Could use more bass. Speakers rattle a bit tho when bass is raised. No card slot I found the remote control a bit too oval for me---it tends to slide around some in my hand. Just nit-picking, but, something had to be wrong!. 
Summary:. This t.v was purchased for the bedroom. I also needed a digital t.v. for the change next year. I don't watch much t.v. but do enjoy movies so was also thinking ahead for blueray/high def. I was not expecting all the extra channels that comes with digital t.v. AND was totally shocked at the picture quality that was coming with only a set of rabitt ears of all things! Rabitt ears! I thought the reception would be horrible. But instead, the HD signal was WAY better than anything I've seen on standard cable. My whole purpose for cable in the old days was mainly for the quality of the picutre. No need for that now with digital!. The remote control is fairly user friendly. We were able to figure out most of the settings just fooling around without refrence to the manual.. Sound is ok, but could have used a bit more low end. And the bass that is there tends to rattle the speakers some.. Got this baby for $500 Canadian at Future Shop! Plus extended warranty, &#38; taxes brought to around $740 and change. Superb price from what other have paid for.. This is a great all around t.v. that could go just about anywhere in the house. It's super great in the bedroom, perfect for my old eyes! And I don't even need cable to get excellent quality reception! ( I might upgrade the rabitt ears tho!) Even the old DVD's look way way better. Depending on the movie. A couple of the movies came very close to HD! wow! I'll be waiting a bit for the blueray prices to come down. This baby handles my current dvds just fine! :). I can't see any reason for spending more money on 1080 p. Thanx to the great advice given here on Cnet, I made an intelligent choice based on contrast ratio, screen size and price. Thanx Cnet for the great help!.......It got 4 1/2 stars just because nothing in this world is perfect!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture and color, perfect size for a bedroom or small living room.. 
Cons:. It is impossible to distinguish the front and rear of the remote by feel. missing an SD card slot.. 
Summary:. The picture and color of this set is quite satisfying. I'm still amazed, after owning the set for 3 months, I'll occasionally flip through the channels and still comment on how great the picture looks. I've had positive reviews from guests as well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is Very Good !. 
Cons:. Nothing to talk. 
Summary:. The Best Price with the best quality to small spaces. 

$$;
Pros:. Good color, brightness and clear, sharp pictures on good sources. 
Cons:. Blacks are solid, but lack detail without tweaking first. 
Summary:. I just bought this TV almost a month ago now and had done my research and along with personal experience, chose the Samsung.. My Mom has had a 20" CRT Samsung TV she bought in I think 1997 that still soldiers on with a very good picture for an analog TV along with the reviews like here on C/Net as well led me to the decision.. Overall I'm very impressed with this set and knew some of the pro's and con's of HD sets in general, like higher resolution and their capabilities in rendering the limits of lesser SD sources and thus showing their flaws more than before. This set will do that too, but since the only HD sources I have currently are the off air HD channels and they look stunning, most SD sources will look quite good, but if the source is not clean, or film based sources grainy, you'll notice it but otherwise, I've found that SD sources will look good for the most part, that is good DVD transfers and the like.. I have this set up as my main TV in the living room and size wise and all that, it's perfect for my space. All of my DVD sources come from a SD DVD recorder and for the most part, what I play on it is very good, source dependant, even older taped TV shows look good, drop outs and all that not withstanding unless not of an early generation master/source.. Over all, easy to set up, tweak and to operate and out of the box, the set looks great, some tweaking, it looks fantastic.. Very glad I bought this set.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful color, lots of picture options.. 
Cons:. Sound problem appeared after 6 weeks- but resolved.. 
Summary:. A great buy for 32" and under- especially as a bedroom TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, Setup, Quality, Ease of use. 
Cons:. The remote is too shinny. 
Summary:. "I purchased the Samsung LN32A450 32inch LCD HD TV on May 3rd 2008 from Best Buy.. The setup out of the box is very easy and the Picture quality is excellent. I am currently connected with Bright House Networks and I have their Digital HD box with a HDMI connection.. The pictures on the HD Channels are awesome you almost feel like your there in person. I was also very impressed in the video quality on the NON-HD Channels, some look almost as good as the HD pictures.. The remote is easy to use and very intuitive, as are the menus to control/modify the TV settings. The downside to the remote is that it has the same glossy black finish as the TV and always looks dirty from all the handling.. Overall this is an excellent TV and I expect it will give me many years of trouble free use.". 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture. 
Cons:. Very Poor Sound. 
Summary:. In my opinion, this is the best 32" LCD for the price. The picture quality is great, and thus far, I have found no problems with the 720p resolution. Be warned, the internal speakers sound terrible. Since this was purchased for the bedroom, I have no plans to connect to an external audio source. The remote control functions are a little weak, but not a huge deal. I've used a Samsung LCD on my PC for years, and have always been impressed by the video quality. I hope that I continue to be just as pleased with this TV..

Pros:. Great image, good price.. 
Cons:. Remote not the best, but will do. 
Summary:. Samsung has replaced all toshiba in our house.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture even if not directly in front. 
Cons:. Speaker sound is horible. 
Summary:. The picture is bright and clear the remote is good It is easy to set up. The speakers are not very good. Updated. on Feb 4, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The color is great. The speakers aren't shabby (nice sound) It fits just right in my small bedroom. This is a t.v. that I bought based on a CNET review. It was under the then "good enough" catergory. I'm pleased with this t.v. Thanks CNET!. 
Cons:. None yet, and I've had it for over a year.. 
Summary:. This is a lcd t.v. that I believe you'll enjoy and the price is reasonable to boot.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of picture controls. It took me the better part of a week to really fine tune the settings for my room conditions. I used HD NBA games, up-scalled Pixar DVDs, Cars on Blu-Ray and There Will Be Blood on Blu-Ray for most of the fine tuning.. 
Cons:. The remote seems lopsided...I used our Dish Network for everyday use. Considering it took me the better part of the week to fine tune may seem like a Con, but for me, I really enjoyed the functionality of it.. 
Summary:. Fine tuning took me a while, though I am a novice. Tons of connectivity. The manuals and set-up guides were very easy to follow. The remote shape is weird, but not a big deal. I have recommended this to friends and they love it. Good buy for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. the design is very slick and stylish,connects to be a moniter. 
Cons:. bad to use if you have children. 
Summary:. this product is the best because of the pictore qualtiy and the fact that it has a moniter port. 

$$;
Pros:. Value, Picture Quality, Tweaking Options, Easy Set Up, Anti Glare Screen. 
Cons:. Saves dead channels when auto programmed. This is not a big deal but I had to manually delete about 30 dead channels the tv saved which was kind of annoying. Espcially because I had to do it twice because of a power outage.. 
Summary:. I spend 2 months comparing tv's and the Samsung A450 seemed to stand out above the rest. The picture quality is outstanding, I did some minor tweaking based on C/Net suggestions which will save power and made things look even better than the presets. The speakers aren't bad for a flat panel, I think they're pretty good as far as speakers go in flat panels. I don't know what some people expect, no tv speaker is going to be as good as a home theatre system. I've had the tv for about 6 weeks, hooked up to cable and haven't experienced the sound distortion some people have mentioned on the HD channels. The screen reflects glare very well, compared to the tube tv this replaced. I have windows on 3 walls and the screen is very viewable in the middle of the day with the curtains wide open. So far so good, I'm very pleased with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of features, good picture, HD looks great, good sound, casing looks nice - the gloss is quite luxe - like that it can control my samsung home theatre, likes that it knows what is connected to the tv.. 
Cons:. the Anyney feature could be improved, could use another hdme port on the back. 
Summary:. The anynet feature is great, although it's a little tough to actually take advantage of it .. it's almost like they didn't think anyone would use the feature. It works great when switching to a DVD, but the annoyance is switching back to the TV. It seems to think that I'm going to be using the coaxial input, so I am stuck with the snow screen, when in fact I am switching to my cable box which is connected with an HDMI cable. It's strange. Other than that hiccup, I think this TV is fantastic, and the price (599CAD) was right in my budget.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Looks, Tons of video customization options, Decent amount of connections, Good blacks, Very good colors, Side connections, Good PC support, Decent speakers.. 
Cons:. Text blurry on PC, Does a extremely poor job at deflecting light.. 
Summary:. I got myself a Samsung LA32A450C1 (Middle East equivalent of the LN32A450C1). I choose this TV after looking at many brands such as Sony, Panasonic, LG, Toshiba, JVC, etc. It offered me the best price for the features and looked way better than anything else.. I have only used this TV as a PC monitor and for Xbox 360 (via HDMI). So I won't be going into how the cable TV looks and what are the pros and cons for that particular feature.. The TV looks classy. The deep black piano finish with the thin clear plastic going at its curvy bottom (which hides the speakers) looks absolutely stunning. It is very elegant. And will look good on any setup. The remote compliments the style of the TV which also feature a piano black top. Now this is certainly not a good thing for those who don't usually take care of their remotes as it will attract a lot of dust and fingers prints.. I am coming from an Acer HDTV of the same size. And i can see a world of a difference between that and this. The contrast ratio of 10,000:1 makes a huge difference. I am no video techie but i like what i see. The default settings will be optimal for most users, especially those who are not very initiated with all the features the TV provides.. They can also make use of the 2 sets of presets the TV provides. In one set you have the Standard, Dynamic and Movie presets. In the second set called 'Entertainment Mode' you have Cinema, Sports, Game presets. Entertainment mode is not available on the PC, however.. The TV manages to produce excellent blacks, enhancing the depth of a movie. The colors are produced wonderfully well too. All the movies appear different to me. It looks so much better now. Especially HD movies, it will take your breath away. The Xbox 360 looks EVEN better, producing an astounding image that made me gasp. I am playing Prince of Persia currently and it looks unbelievably amazing. Not to mention the ?Just Scan? feature that does a 1:1 pixel mapping. Say good bye to overscanning!. The speaker equipped with the SRS Trusurround XT does an extremely good job. It is not as bad as people make it out to be, unless your ears are fine tuned to nitpick. The virtual surround position works well. The volume is sufficiently loud. It also comes with its own presets ? Standard, Speech, Music, etc. Of course, they are not perfect. It does lack a bit of bass but that is fine considering they are TV speakers. Using external speakers is recommended but if you can live without having the perfect sound, the TV speakers will do a perfectly good job.. Coming to the shortcomings. I use this TV as a PC monitor and I find the text a bit blurry. It over does the Clear Type font effect that Windows uses to produce a shadow to make the text look smoother. I am getting used to it but it is kind of annoying. It is perfect otherwise however. Movies and games look spectacular. I just wish the PC input had more video options enabled. But this is a standard practice on all TVs. I am not sure why, though.. The second and the most annoying shortcoming of this TV is that it does a very poor job at deflecting light. It is ironic that it fails this because the TV is supposed to have this ?Clear Panel? feature to keep the light sources at bay! This is very annoying for me as I have a light just behind the TV and it interferes with the image. So be careful in purchasing this TV and were you will place it. I had to replace the bulb with a dim light!. In the end, even with the two shortcoming of the TV, the pros totally outweigh the cons. If you are looking for a 32? HDTV, and will not use it as a PC monitor and can place it in a proper place, look no further than this. It is brilliant. Highly recommended!. Updated. on Jan 11, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Strong picture quality,sound,and available pre-sets are all good.. Picture on menu somewhat confusing.Overall a very good set for the price.. I did by a isf disc to tweek the colors .It Helped.. 
Cons:. At 16.9x720p the set reverts to a 4.3 picture in a crop setting. This may be a bad. hd receiver?. 
Summary:. Good picture .Solid sound. Nice looking ,hanging on wall (wires hidden) Many adjustments available to suite anyones likes. Like anynet+so other devices can be used. "GREAT SET" You will luv it. 

$$;
Pros:. SOLID PICTURE AND UPSCALE PERFORMANCE. 
Cons:. NON-1080P,EXPENSIVE. 
Summary:. This is my first non-SONY television purchase and I am sold! The SAMSUNG edged out the BRAVIA in this quality and size television. My main Television is a SONY 52"XBR4 and this can compete with my beast at 32". I love this set!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to Use. 
Cons:. None that I have found. 
Summary:. I bought this TV after lots of googling and Cnet reviews. It is surprisingly easy to set up and use. It has more than enough in/out ports for all of my devices. I am using this TV with a Dish Network ViP622 and am truly amazed by the picture quality. I looked at several units in the same size and general price range $699 - $1300. I could not tell any difference between the 720P capable model and the 1080P model. There was a huge difference between the other brands. I would absolutly recomend this unit. It is fantastic.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture quality for the price. It handles 480i/p resolution sources very well, and HD sources even better (with cables of corresponding quality). You will have to pay quite a bit more to find a better picture.. 
Cons:. There is no excuse for such miserable speakers on a product costing hundreds of $. You will definitely want to use external speakers. I would give it a solid four-star rating if the speakers were of the same quality as the screen.. 
Summary:. At this size and price level (and point in time), you will not find another TV that is overall superior to the A450. Everything about it is very good to excellent (except the internal speakers). In the store, I thought maybe 32" was a bit small, but in my living room, I find it entirely sufficient. 37" would also be fine, but 40" would be overkill IMHO. I only sit 8' from the TV and am glad I didn't spend more for a larger screen. If you also don't sit very far from the TV, save yourself the money for a larger screen and spend it on high quality cables. You will not be disappointed! HOWEVER, this TV only excels with the Samsung screen. Samsung is also using cheaper quality screens from two other manufactures in at least the A450 and A550 and selling them as the same model for the same price, although there is a huge difference in screen quality! Look for the S, A, or C at the beginning of the version# on the back of the panel (please refer to my response to a user review of the 46A550 for more info). Only the S panels are made by Samsung. The A and C panels made by AU Optronics and Chi Mei Optoelectronics respectively are not worth the money. Buyer beware!. 

$$;
Pros:. This TV is connected to a DirecTV HDTV receiver. The picture quality is very good, and the feature set and screen size is appropriate for this application. My bedroom has a Southeast facing and is very bright and this TV is good in a bright room.. 
Cons:. Nothing so far. I'm happy with it.. 
Summary:. It helped that Amazon dropped the price on this set briefly to $600.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price for the image quality. 
Cons:. Sporadic shutdown and restart, and Samsung support was just horrible..... 
Summary:. Bought this set for my sister. She did not know much, and did not want to spend a lot. So did a bit of digging around, and decided to not go for a full HD set, as frankly for this size, you don't see the difference.. My sister was very happy with the set and the cable HD tuner I got her. 2 months after the purchase, the TV started to shutdown and restart on its own. Sometimes, it would do this 10 times in one evening. Needless to say my sister was unhappy, and of course needed the brother support to figure out what to do.. I'm leaving the huge pain details of dealing with Samsung to get any type of descent support aside here.... but it took 3 attempts to "may be" fix the problem.. 1- Took the TV to a certified repair shop myself, as Samsung did not have a repair shop near by my sister to make a service call, as per there warranty.... When I asked the local repair shop, they said Samsung is very slow to pay us (when they do), and therefore will only repair sets they sold themself.... The tech changed the main board and the small board for managing the remote. Problem came back 1 month after.. 2- Call Samsung again, and they asked me to download the a new firmware and flash the set. So, they knew there was a problem with those sets and were attemtping to fix via some software upgrade. Except, the flash did not help, they did not get it..... 3- I was really getting upset, called Dumoulin (which sold me the TV) and they dealt with Samsung on one side, and found a repair shop to go at my sister's place (the brother was getting tired of being the tech for Samsung...) and they went and changed pretty much anything that looks like a card in there.. Its been now 2 months and the set did not experience any problem yet..... So, when you make a choice to buy a set, don't just focus on the emotional moment when you're at the store and comparing all of those side by side. Keep in mind there are very little margins in selling those sets now, and the potential support (god forbid) you may have to get will not be there for you.. For the store, they obviously make up with the folks that think they need to buy HDMI cables at 50+$.... Again, for them, it may be difficult as they will fallback on the supplier waranty ruling.... So, Xmas is coming, my investigation with speaking with half a dozen repair shops who have dealt with Samsung a lot..... all confirmed, good sets, they don't have more problems then others in general, but yes, the support (at least here in Canada) is the worst of all..... Beware!. 

$$;
Pros:. They look nice, Picture is very good if it works. Menu system is nice to use.. 
Cons:. These lower end models 530,540 and 550's are plagued with problems you can expect to have early repair issue's.. 
Summary:. I have went through 4 of samsungs lcd tv's in the last month and a half. I first tried the LN32530 and it had a cluster of 6 or so dead pixels bright green up in the upper right hand side of the LCD so I returned it for a LN40550 only to get it home and set it up and guess what the same problem dead pixels in the exact same spot as the LN32530. The future shop rep told me that it was an out dated model and the new B530s didn't have the problem's that the older series have. So I exchanged that for a new LN37B530 and the screen is fine but it keeps making this very loud buzzing noise that gets louder and cuts in and out and it is not my HDMI cables because it does it when the HDMI cables are unplugged and when the volume is muted and if you wiggle the HDMI cable it get louder. If I where you I would steer away from these lower end models and go with something like the Samsung LN52A650 series. I have a LN52A650 also it works great without any problems the only problem with the 650 series and 120 hertz is the auto motion sticks sometimes and creates an aura around the moving subject but you can lesson this by turning the auto motion setting to a lessor value or just turning it off. It is also helpful if you visit the support web page for a certain tv product before you by it because you can see what problem that specific model has before you purchase it. Good Luck!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, renders standard TV well, lots of settings. 
Cons:. sound distortion on HD channels.. 
Summary:. Thought this was a great set. I had bought it for better movie viewing, not because I was going to switch to HDTV.. TV has great picture and lots of settings. Unfortunately, found out that this TV has a flaw when rendering sound in HDTV. Harsh robotic distortion seems to occur after a power outage or unplugging the set. You have to press the exit button for 10 seconds to return to factory default settings, and this clears it up. Still not acceptable as a solution. Does not appear to effect HD when using a cable box or standard TV signal. Only when viewing HDTV stations.. If you're going to use HDTV and use the built in tuner, buy at your own risk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set-up, swivel stand, decent blacks, good custom controls. 
Cons:. Bad non-HD picture, tinny sound quality. 
Summary:. Based on the CNET reviews and the encouragement of the salesman at Circuit City, I purchased this television to replace a Sony 37"Trinitron Wega. Boy was that a mistake.. My biggest concern, oddly enough, was amount of space that the TV would take up in our living room. The Sony had a fabulous picture, but it was an eyesore and too big and cumbersome to keep. But when I got the slick, thin Samsung home and plugged it in, the picture quality was, hands down, noticeably worse than the old Sony. Then I read that cathode ray tube televisions *still* have a better picture than LCD and Plasma TV's, at least when you're viewing non-HD. What an understatement.. I was mistakenly told by the salesman that Sony, Samsung, and LG tv's all had a feature that improved the picture of non-HD shows. What he didn't tell me was that that feature isn't available unless you have an HD receiver *and* you're watching a non-HD channel. Good grief. Which meant that, to make the picture quality on this TV even passable, I had to shell out $100 for an HD box from my satellite tv company plus be prepared to pay $10 more per month for hd reception. What a scam.. Bottom line: unless you're planning to upgrade to HD everything (which means the HD box), be prepared for a really sub-par picture and sound. Very unimpressed with this tv, and very surprised at the high rating it has received on this site..

Pros:. One of the best pictures out there. 
Cons:. Audio problems -- worst customer service. 
Summary:. I bought the predecessor of this model in January-- it had audio problems from the outset which were never fixed. I've had no TV for almost 3 months and it will be at least another month before I get this model to replace it from Samsung. By far the worst customer service experience I have ever had.. 

$$;
Pros:. the features set this apart. 
Cons:. some picture lag. 
Summary:. The ease of use and features set this tv apart from many. The one thing that isn't so great is there is some picture lag when watching shows where the people and camera are moving at the same time. (it is a little blurry). 

$$;
Pros:. Many features, good television picture. 
Cons:. Bad computer compatibility, popping noises from the set. 
Summary:. I had two of these televisions. The original one was working fine until I noticed loud popping sounds coming from the back of the TV. The samsung repairman came and claimed that this is normal. This was much more than just the heat sync - the whole television would pop like someone was banging on the plastic. This makes watching the TV very distracting and often upsetting. Amazon replaced the first one and the second one did the same thing. These are very audible and distracting during TV watching. If it werent for the sound I would be giving the TV a 9.. I also feel that there was some ghosting, but it could be that my eyes are not used to it and the standard def video tends to ghost more than digital.. 

$$;
Pros:. The reviews I read made it seem like a good deal. Got one from newegg.com.. 
Cons:. It stopped working.. 
Summary:. After a few months while watching a dvd. an error message would pop up saying "device not found" and or the source would change to the tv tuner. Sometimes it would just display the message.. Now that I've had it for 13 months and the warrany has run out; the tv can only be turned on by pressing the power button on the tv. The remote has no effect other than to make the red light on the tv blink. I can get to the menu but cannot select any menu items so I can't try a factory reset.. I came across this site http://forums.cnet.com/5208-13973_102-0.html?threadID=375771&#38;tag=forums06;forum-threads. while looking for tips to solve my problem. Seems like there are a lot of unhappy Samsung owners.. google: consumer affairs samsung tvs. Wish I would have googled that 13 months ago.. I believed the hype.. Samsung goes on to my never to buy list.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very nice colors, Very sharp in still images,. 
Cons:. In motions, picture is ghosty even after setting the NR off. 
Summary:. This is a great TV if you are not going to watch TV. )) kidding ...the picture quality on still and stable images is awesome but once the actor or actress start moving their face and lines of their face gets blurred and it turns sharp again very fast. But these changes in picture is really noticeable to me even if I set the NR(Noise Reduction) off...Other than that everything else is perfect in this TV...Sound is great to with SRS..... 

$$;
Pros:. - Picture quality was good for the first year. 
Cons:. - Poor reliabiity probably due to Samsung using low quality T-CON boards on this model. - Poor customer service and tech support. Referred to a repair center 90 miles away, despite numerous repair centers in the locall metro area.. 
Summary:. Features and functionality of this TV were very good. Sound quality was just OK, but suitable for a bedroom unit. However, the picture failed just beyond the warranty period, apparently a common problem with Samsung LCD TVs. Entire experience in dealing with customer service and tech support was extremely frustrating and did not yield any results other than to be referred once again to a repair shop 90 miles away. If considering a Samsung product, definitely purchase an extended warranty (I didn't) and hope for the best if dealing with customer service and tech support.. 

$$;
Pros:. has agreat picture and never needs picture adjusting.... 
Cons:. 4 months out of warranty started on/off cycling and then staying off for up to 12 hours.No satisfaction from the company about this problem that occurs in just about all models built in 07 or 08 and now 09 Also speakers are crappy. 
Summary:. I like the picture quality . I don't have a problem with that. Customer service is cold and impolite regarding the power off/on problem ...also crappy sound. 

$$;
Pros:. You can have a TV picture for 18 months of 1hr/day use.. 
Cons:. The TV only lasted for 18 months before turning into a white screen.. 
Summary:. I am very upset with Samsung. I would have thought they would have better quality, which is why I purchased them over other no-name TVs. Apparently this wasn't the case.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing good. 
Cons:. Everthing...its a terrible company. BEWARE!!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. Samsung will not help out any said sorry about your luck. Never buy any Samsung products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks nice as a decoration but that's not why I bought it.. 
Cons:. After 18 months the picture suddenly became nearly all white with very faint inverted colors. Have not been able watch the TV since.. 
Summary:. Like another reviewer noted, this was also a secondary TV so did not get much use yet after 18 months it is completely unwatchable. One night I had it on, left the room to come back to see a nearly all white screen with inverted colors. Samsung needs to address this issue because it has failed due to a manufacturer flaw and not due to abuse or overuse.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was fun while it lasted, but the sad thing is that this was NOT the main tv in the house. It didn't even get wear-n-tear enough to justify a problem.. 
Cons:. I've heard of many with the same problem as mine at 18 MONTHS. I wonder why there wasn't a recall or some kind of compensation for us. I really feel duped.. 
Summary:. I am sad Samsung will not stand behind this product. A tv costing hundreds should last more than 18months!!! Or at least a warranty longer than a year. Warranty expires--- expect the death of your tv in about 6 months or so. I will not give them my business again.. 

$$;
Pros:. The first year and a half, when it worked, the picture was good--black really black, crisp, etc.. 
Cons:. The sound is very poor, to the point where I had to add speakers.. 18 months (note: 6 months after warranty expired), the picture is gone--just a white screen with the negative outline of figures.. 
Summary:. If reviews were written down the line, instead of right after purchase, it would help more people. A $700 TV, garbage after 18 months! Ironically, I researched like mad before buying this. When it comes to electronics, I guess a one-year warranty is standard but it shouldn't be. We live in an expensive, disposable world. Now, I'll have to pay to bring it to a recycling center, to add injury to insult.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are no pros to this piece of junk.. 
Cons:. It turns on and off by itself if it comes on at all.. The sound is awful.. 
Summary:. I have had this tv for 1 1/2 years. It started turning on and off by itself just after the warranty ran out. Sometimes it takes a 1/2 to turn on at all. The speakers are terrible, I had to hook the tv up to my stereo on day one; first tv I've ever had to do that to. My tv before this one was made in 1984 by a company I'd never heard of. It never gave me a day of trouble. Luckily it's still in the basement because this Samsung LN32A450 is going into the junk pile. I will never buy Samsung again. $400 thrown away.. Updated. on Mar 26, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture but now dead.. 
Cons:. Died in 25 days. 
Summary:. It was amazing when it lasted. No more . 25 days and the TV wont turn ON. God Bless Samsung. I came to know on the web that samsung sets have these problems. Lets see how Samsung handles my warranty will surely update you guys..
