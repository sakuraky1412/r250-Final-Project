Cheap fix for an old washer; take the agitator off, put these in, replace the agitator, and you're back in business.
You can even flip the old ones around sometimes to get a bit more use out of them, but these are cheap enough to put in if you're going to take the time to fix the washer anyway.
GOOD DOGS.
Very good price & delivery.
Common failure with the whilrlpool agitator after a few years of service.
I'm in and out with these replacement parts on the van.
Great!!.
Consider the wisdom of spending a lot of money on replacement parts for a 10+ year old washer that you originally bought for $400.
This is one of the cheaper parts so I could see getting this one (and maybe the lid switch or motor couplings).
If you're having problems with your motor/clutch/timer or other electrical part, you might want to think about getting another top loader like an Amana before they stop carrying them in stores in about a year or so.
