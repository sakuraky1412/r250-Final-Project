this place looks nice , but keep in mind a $ 17+ resort fee for things other properties in san diego would give you for free .
really hard rock , i dont need the latest issue of rolling stone .
hotel bait and switched me and countless others and then had the nerve to not try and mend the problem .
contacted the tripadvisor review guy ( mdufor ) after hotel asked me to do so , but he didnt help me at all , then i replied to him with the information necessary for him to help as the hard rock stated he would but that email wound up being bounced back to my inbox the next day ?
maybe he blocked my address rather than try to help me .
always had wanted to stay here thus my reservation .
i will stick to the great 4 star properties located nearby that do not have resort fees and have great customer service !
as for the room , quite small and there were hairs in the shower !
come on hard rock , i dont need some other guests hairs .
obviously i expect a response from tripadvisor guy now , but what good is it unless i was to return .
there was potential to return given a ridiculous rate/offer , but hard rock messed that up too , that is a whole other story , that i will refrain from mentioning here on tripadvisor , you can look up their twitter account regarding their `` black friday promotion '' and see . . .
