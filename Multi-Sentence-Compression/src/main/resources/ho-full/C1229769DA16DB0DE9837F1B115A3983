this was one of our last stops on our motorcycle journey through eurasia and as we arrived just after the raing and during heavy wind of the storm that was hitting europe so badly at this time , a hot shower and a comfy nice , warm blanket was very welcome .
this of course was n't only , what made the hotel so great .
being welcome so friendly , guided to the secure parking , help with getting the luggage up to the room and getting a huge smile from the reception every time you pass by just makes you feel great after such trouble .
the rooms were large and clean , daylight bright and comfy .
the bed itself has been absolutely large enough , blanket warm just as expected , the room heated already , shower water hot immediately .
we dropped our things and fell into warm heaven .
further we went to go explore the schoenbrunn castle and surrounding neighbourhood as well as the gardens , for which the hotel simply has the perfect location .
you ca n't be much closer to it unless you live in the castle yourself ; - ) breakfast has been plainly delicious , enough choice and fresh .
the interiour , design , furniture , they just simply fit into the hotel which blends in with the local surrounding and neighborhood .
you 'll feel home once you get there and stay a night or two .
you can even walk to downtown and explore the city which will be a very nice walk and . . .
