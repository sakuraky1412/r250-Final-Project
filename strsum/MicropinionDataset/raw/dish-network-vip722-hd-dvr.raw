Pros:. I can record my favorite shows, skip boring commercials, delete when needed and save what ever i want to watch. I am able to keep up yo date with any show I want to watch. When on vacation , all the shows i missed were waiting on me when I got back.. 
Cons:. There not hardly anything to complain about, of course If you don't read the manual on how to use it, (Duh) then some people may have a problem. If you get one take the time to learn how to use it , or have your children show you how to use it.. 
Summary:. Simple , record what i want to watch it when I want to watch it. Easy to use for the new tech literate person. Not for those stuck back in the 50's in tv watching mentality, unless you have someone who can show you how to use it This system is for the new technology literate people. If all you know how to do is change channels, it may not be for you. My 86 year old granny loves it cause we recorded some of her favorite old movies she can watch anytime. she exclaimed , what will they come up with next!. Has to be one of the Best products on the market. Of course we got it free with Dish Network promotion for New Customers. Who would pay for it, when they will give it to you for free. The picture is crystal clear , especially on our new High Definition TV. You can see the details in all outdoor films, and the color quality is fantastic. You can actually almost count the feathers on birds. And it shows what movie stars and model really look like up close. Really , really good. Great for new action movies and all other programming. I see why the won the best award. enough said , Get one , you won't be sorry you did.. 

$$;
Pros:. The 722, is awesome,. it just works , and works well.. 
Cons:. Hooking it to more than one tv will not work if someone else might be using "tv2". The 612vip is a better option.. 
Summary:. Great machine almost all of the cons in the main review have been fixed.. Well worth the extra $5 a month.. Updated. on Jun 28, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Best picture quality that I've received. Its better than DTV and comcast in my opinion. This DVR also allows the user to record much more programming than the others.. 
Cons:. Dish Network has less HDTV programming than DirecTV.. 
Summary:. This is easily the best HDDVR that I've ever used, and I've had Directv and Comcast previously. Not only is the monthly cost far less exuberant, but the DVR itself is a superior machine. User friendliness is a big deal for me, since my roommate is what you might call "technologically illiterate", but even he can utlize all of the functions on this receiver. The 722 model 350 hours of stock availability compared to DTV's crappy 150 and Comcasts even crappier 100. Also, this receiver has many functions that are a Godsend. You can literally record three programs at one time while simultaneously watching a 4th pre-recorded program. Its unbelievable. As I've already stated, I've had several DVRs before through other companies and this one is easily the best I've ever used.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unit is super fast an easy to use. 30 second jumps are lightening fast.. Recording is a breeze.. This simply put desighed flawlessly.. Do not pass up the new 722!. 
Cons:. This unit does not have the intuitive brain of a tivo. Its strictly a recording device that will follow your comands.. 
Summary:. If you want a state of the art DVR look no further. This will take your tv watching to another level.. I have had all the other DVRS. Nothing compared to Dishes 622\722.. 

$$;
Pros:. I really love this peice of machine. All its amazine features of pause and record TV. High Definition brodcasts. One of the greatest so far. Thanks Dish. 
Cons:. I really don't like the fact that to use the PIP (picture in picture) function you need to have it in "single" mode. Which just completly knocks tv out for "TV2". 
Summary:. Thanks Dish keep up the superb work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Storage; ease of use; picture quality. 
Cons:. It is really hard to come up with any!. 
Summary:. I just upgraded to the Vip 722. The choice was easy and I have NO regrets. I had DirectTV before I switched to Dish SD. I was much more impressed with Dish, Hands Down. Dish suited my channel choices much better than Direct. Then after six months of SD, I bumped up to HD. On my Vizio 37 LCD, I get a great picture from HD and the SD isn't bad either. The completely user friendly basic function is great for even my 5 year old. She can easily find her recorded Sponge Bob's in 2 seconds flat. Plus the ability to fine tune and take full advantage of the Vip 722's high end features was easy to find and set up for a technofile like me. My girlfriends brother has Driect HD and I find that the picture quality is exactly the same, the programming on Direct, for my likes, is lacking and the user interface and remote are much more convoluted on Direct.. The DVR storage and retrieval on Dish is perfect. I can scan the progams list, my recordings and menu with ease. The DVR is phenominal. I haven't had a single complaint or issue with Dish at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great DVR, easy to use, can watch/record 3 channels. 
Cons:. Defaults to recording all programs instead on new or once. 
Summary:. I have both a TIVO and the VIP722 and the 722 in my opinion blows it away. The picture quality is much better, it has an RF remote, 30 sec skip and ability to watch record 3 shows.. 

$$;
Pros:. TV2 can control at least 4TVs W/ coax splitter. 
Cons:. Inability to delist pay channels from HD menu. 
Summary:. I have had the 622 for close to 2 years now.Aside from my 50" industrial Panasonic HDTV monitor, there is no high tech toy that has given me greater pleasure. The optical outlet enables me to connect to my older AV receiver for DTS or 5.1 sound. 

$$;
Pros:. no phone line needed(network),one reciever two rooms, pic in pic,. 
Cons:. none---I guess in general Dish could have more interactive programming.. 
Summary:. Dish really did a great job on this one. I had directv before and their recievers are slow responding, small recording times, and picture quality isnt as good as this reciever. This will also hook up via your network. This utilizes updates and Dish on Demand.. Hooked up to a Toshiba 47inch LCD-HDMI. Optical audio to Sony reciever. AMAZING sound!. 

$$;
Pros:. Capacity, Download w/ DSL, and portable hardrive compatable.. 
Cons:. Color???, nothinh else.. 
Summary:. 4 months in and I have still not had to delete ne thing I didn't want to. The capacity destroys the competition.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of hard drive space. Easy to use (my 6yr old know how to). PIP is easy to use and very nice also. Constantly getting sofware upgrades. I record from my Iphone and my PC. Can add more storage. 
Cons:. 1 hour play back, I miss the 2 hours on prev. models. Gotta pay one time 39.99 for extra storage. Nothing else really. 
Summary:. Have had the same DVR box since July 2008 just in time for the Olympics and never and I mean never had a problem with it. Never had TiVo so I can't compare the 2.. 

$$;
Pros:. i havent hat any hd dvr before , this is my firts one and is real good not a single problem in 3 months. 
Cons:. i think the i read a lot before buy it and i know what to expect from this dvr hd. 
Summary:. the best in the recording option , because you dont loose any program and you pause live tv for any reason (phone, ring bell anything) and you dont loose you show. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent audio/video quality. User friendly program guides, timers and archiving tools.. I now have an extensive number of archived films, sports, &#38; TV shows (most in HD). To do this, I have bought an embarrassing number of USB External Hard Dives.. 
Cons:. I frequently get a message saying I will have to delete timers to make room for more. Changing many timers seems to overwhelm the 722 software and it forces a restart. I spread out my timing modification sessions to avoid restarts.. 
Summary:. Although I know very little about DVRs from TIVO or Direct TV, etc., I can't think of any feature the 722 lacks. Although one has to pay a one time fee of less than $40 for enabling the archiving capability, I consider it well worth the money.. Updated. on Jan 6, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. 300 STANDAR AND 55 HD IS GOOD. 5.1 CRISTAL CLEAR QUALITYAUDIO. USB MULTIMEDIA, CAPACITY FOR CONNECT (3) EXTERNAL HARDDRIVES IS A GREAT TOOLS. BLACK GAVINET IS A LUXURY STYLE. SINGLE \ DUAL MODE IS A GOOD TOOLS.. 
Cons:. NEED UPGRADE TO 1080p resolution. AND 7.1 AUDIO DTS. NEED VIDEO1 AND VIDEO2 INPUT FEATURE INTEGRATED TO THE PROGRAM GUIDE SIMILAR TO THE OLD MODEL 811 HD RECEIVER FOR DVD OR DIGITAL CAMERA WITH CAPACITY TO RECORD AUDIO AND VIDEO.. 
Summary:. I HAVE ACTIVE A vip722 HD DVR ON SEPTEMBER 4 2007 AND MY EXPERIENCY WITH THIS TECNOLOGY IS GREAT. ALL FEATURE IS VERY GOOD. NO TROUBLE. IS A PERFECT EQUIPMENT.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speed and HD. 
Cons:. Search Function. 
Summary:. Very good unit. I had Direct's standard definition DVR and it took forever to move through the menu. Dish's DVR is fast!!! Also Dish's multiple room concept with one unit is a smart money saving idea.. Only negative for this unit in comparison to Direct's unit, is the awkward means to search for movies and favorite stars. Direct TV unit have built-in list and all you have to do is click on a star and the unit will find the programming.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multi-room operation, excellent picture quality and dolby sound, high capacity, flexibilty/optional OTA view and record, ample connections. 
Cons:. Minor quirks with remote (like when using fast forward when you revert to play it skips forward quite a bit). Menus aren't exceptionally intuitive, but are functional.. 
Summary:. I just took their HD only package which was just upgraded and contains most of the channels I ever watched with DirecTV. Only thing I'll miss from the zillion channel packages is FSN, but I'm hoping they'll make the Multi-Sports package available as an add-on (then this deal really becomes a 10). Overall, though, the picture and sound are impressive. Since I have OTA, my cost with the DVR is only $36 a month - has to be the best deal on the planet.. 

$$;
Pros:. One touch recording right from the guide. 
Cons:. No HD on a second set. 
Summary:. This is the easiest DVR I've ever used and I've tried several. The menu's are simple, the picture is great, and you can set things once and never worry about it again. You can even set a timer for one of your favorite programs and set it to record all. It will then record the program even if it airs on another channel, without recording the same episode twice! The box will operate two televisions or one with PIP capabilities, and you can toggle between the two options. It records in HD and has external Hard Drive capabilities. The only drawback I can think of is that it does not broadcast to the second television in HD. Dish Network does not currently broadcast locals in HD in my market, but I called them to figure out how I could make that happen. I picked up a $40 antenna and ordered two $3 diplexers. The antenna mounts to the dish mounting on my roof (it's a ranch) and the diplexer allows you to combine the two signals so only one line is going into the house. Then the second diplexer goes on the inside and splits the signal back out to the two jacks on the box. Best part is that you can record three programs at once now. Two signals off the dish and one from the antenna!. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive menus, huge hard drive, very responsive, wide screen EPG, 10 day searchable EPG, "Single Mode" is fantastic. 
Cons:. They could dress up the look of the menus and EPG although they are very functional. 
Summary:. My girlfriend lives in an apartment building and is thus relegated to cable. She has the cable DVR and I can't begin to explain how inferior the cable DVR is to my 722! The hard drive is limited, there is no widescreen EPG, and it is very sluggish to respond to remote control commands. Worst of all the cable DVR does not have a 30 second skip forward button. The 30 second skip forward button on my 722 is perfect for zapping commercials. It beats the heck out of fast forwarding and then overshooting.. I have not tried a Tivo box to make a comparison to that. I went with Dish's 722 because it got such good reviews and it was a free upgrade. I don't regret my decision!. 

$$;
Pros:. HD very attractive feature.. 
Cons:. Needs more storage capacity. 
Summary:. Can wait to get a new one with more capacity on the HD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to set up and use. 
Cons:. Have not found any yet. 
Summary:. Set up was very easy. The unit comes with a usable "All Subscribed" channels list. There are 4 user assignable favorites list. Search defaults to the "All Subscribed" list which contains Sports Packages and PPV. This list can be edited with "Channel Locks," "Lock PPV" and "Hide Locked" options. After setting up "Locks" the DVR will only search and record unblocked channels.. Creating TiVo-like Wish Lists can be done through the remote: 2 button is "a,b,c 3 is d,e,f. Being able to key the search terms really speeds search time. There a myriad of other recording options which all work.. For Home Theater users the remote comes preprogrammed to operate TV, receiver and VCR/DVD. This can be accomplished manually or automatically. Volume default is assignable. When it determines which code works the TV, the DVR automatically adjusts the picture output to match the TV at either 480i, 480p, 720p or 1080i.. On screen guide has seven different customizations so you can choose font size and number of channels to display with or without picture. Other DVRs limit the display to a very short 4 or 5 lines.. There is a PIP feature that allows you to view two satellite pictures at the same time in a variety of different formats, including split screen.. This DVR replaced a short lived competitor's DVR which replaced a 7 year old TiVo with a large hard drive. So far the ViP722 has the best software package.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent quality picture; sufficient HD channel choices!. 
Cons:. Setup a bit more difficult than described.. 
Summary:. Since writing our previous review (under the ViP622), we've had a bit more time. And guess what, we had to have them send a replacement 722 because a minor hardware problem - we started getting a "jumping freeze frame" with normal audio. But their tech support has been great, so we are not downgrading our rating.. The HD picture is incredible. And, in fact, we just watched the new Law &#38; Order CI on USA - non-HD but wide screen and the picture was incredibly clear for digital standard definition TV compared to our older Dish receiver-recorders we still use.. Also, we added a Western Digital MyBook Essential 750GB External Hard Drive which expands the storage capacity of the system to what appears to be about 100 HD movies. (If you choose to do this, do not buy the MyBook Premium Edition as it has some nifty things you might want for your computer, but not for this use).. Here's our original review:. We have been Echostar (Dish Network's parent company) satellite TV service customers since 1988. The company tries to provide, and generally succeeds in providing, adequate, competitive service. Based on our own experience when we had two homes plus on the experience of friends and family, Dish Network's service is on a par with, if not better than, cable service and DirectTV. Keep in mind for any of them: "sometimes the magic works and sometimes it doesn't.". With that said, we did not leap into Dish HD even though we've had a 42 inch HD plasma tv since 2003. The reason was simple, we live in the Redwoods and most of the initial Dish HD signals were on satellites we cannot "see." (The satellite companies are clear - lacking an unobstructed "southern sky" view can be a problem for service, a problem not found in cable service.) We still cannot get some of the HD service we theoretically are paying for because of this. But almost every HD feed we'd like to see we now can. (We also waited a few months for the release of the ViP722 because it is black as are the other components in our home theater system.). Since we were adding to our Dish Network Standard Definition service (keeping our existing two receiver/recorders active) , we knew what we were getting into. If you are new to satellite TV browse the links at http://www.dbstalk.com/ and particularly the Dish Network info at http://ekb.dbstalk.com/. Things went pretty much as expected. We called the Dish Network number and explained we wanted to add an HD 722 receiver/recorder to our existing two feeds - four feeds total. The woman took the order without needing alot of explanation and but she gave an incorrect price which she couldn't get straight, but...oh well.... Three days later two installers wearing shirts with the Dish logo arrived in a old, but well maintained, unmarked pickup. One spoke only Spanish, but the other who was the lead was fluently bilingual. (My Spanish is comparable to George Bush's so I speak English but listen carefully.) The lead installer discussed his flawed work order with me, called his supervisor to get permission to do what we had ordered. Installation went well. But, you need to know that we had the cables to our theater system hooked up with the end plugs for the ViP722 waiting on the shelf for the installer to plug in. He will likely not have with him more than RCA's for composite video and two channel sound and an S-video cable. We have HD component connections and an optical surround sound connector to our theater system, plus an S-video and RCA stereo to our additional room distribution box. He activated the system which resulted in most signals being activated before he left, but some (local channels for instance) took another three hours. (We knew this would happen from previous experiences with changing our programming.). Even though we had prevous service with older (508) recorders, the menu's for the 722 are complex and require some deciphering, the adequate operating manual notwithstanding. For us, the Dish Tech Portal at http://tech.dishnetwork.com/departmental_content/TechPortal/content/tech/receiver/722.shtml is very helpful. Nonetheless, after about two weeks of setting it up like we want it, the HD picture and 5.1 sound is as good as our DVD player provides (no we don't have brand new HD or BluRay) and certainly as good as we are ever going to be able to appreciate.. For us, several consideration were involved. Even though we did not have cable service available when we first moved here, we now have Comcast which is our high speed internet service provider. We had Comcast in our other home and two of our adult kids have Comcast. We have no problem with Comcast but it would be more expensive and they are just now upgrading to be able to offer HD in the future. We could have gotten a huge new customer discount from DirectTV, but DirectTV's packages are not what we want (we aren't big sports enthusiasts) and they are just beginning the process of providing HD. Additionally, no other service has provided the state-of-the-art recording technology as reliablly as Dish. Some people prefer TiVo, but that appears to be a personal preference. We do have rare weather related signal losses. But our cable system goes down more frequently and in a power outage it simply goes down. With satellite our battery backup lasts long enough for us to start up our generator without losing service and programs being recorded. In a two or three day power outage which does occur every four or five years, this is a big plus.. 

$$;
Pros:. Once set up and learned, great features.. 
Cons:. Hardware failure rate. 
Summary:. I love the product but had one fail about 9 months ago. I don?t recall how long it ran before it failed. I don't feel it's right that Dish wants customers to pay to insure their equipment or you deal with repair costs if you don?t pay the monthly insurance fee. When the unit failed 9 mo. ago the tech rep put the monthly insurance on and said take it back off once I get the new unit. 9 mo. Later the next unit failed. They did the same thing only now they charge a $25 fee if you cancel the $6/mo insurance before 5 months. This may seem off topic but it is pertinent because based on my experience, it's not unlikely that you'll have to have the unit replaced at some point and you will be using it with Dish.. 

$$;
Pros:. Features are as advetised and very usefull. 
Cons:. IIt never really "shuts down", burning eletricity 24/7, on or "off".. It runs hot, 24/7 so durning the cooling season there is a double energy penalty as it also adds heat to the living space.. 

$$;
Pros:. Generally good functionality. 
Cons:. Switching to/from closed caption awful.. 
Summary:. Generally, I have been very impressed with this receiver. But there are several control functions that are a real pain. I happen to be hard of hearing and often want to switch the "close caption" on or off. To do this it takes an unbelievable 17 button pushes to either turn the closed caption on OR off.. Not quite as bad, but to time record (DVR) a program or delete a program it seems like one has to go thru an unecessaryly large number of "navigations" before you can get the job done. And, there is no way one can stop a recording once it has started. You simply have to wait it out!. On the postive side, I really like the 30 second skip and 10 second reverse skip feature on the recorder.. Also, I liked the dual HD output capability (HDMI and Component). With this I was able to connect our HD TV in our living room with the Component output while using a 50' HDMI cable (yes, HDMI can be that long!!) to our bedroom HD TV. And, of course, I have used TV2 to pipe analog TV throughout our house to other analog TVs, all with just the one 722 receiver.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Great picture quality.. -High DVR capacity.. -Can pause Live TV on 2 televisions if you aren't recording anything. (Wait... That's actually a "Con", in my book.). 
Cons:. -Can't watch live TV while recording.. -Changing channels is very slow.. -Rewind and Fast Forward speeds are very inconsistent, easy to overshoot.. -Menu is not intuitive; particularly with regard to Timers.. -Software is a bit buggy and clunky.. 
Summary:. This is my first Dish DVR. I was a longtime cable DVR user, and I am very disappointed at no longer being able to watch one live show (on each TV) and record another (on each TV). This is a HUGE oversight by whoever designed these DVR units. The whole point of being able to time shift is: NOT tying up your TV with whatever you are recording.. With the cable company's Scientific Atlanta box, for example, I could record 2 shows and watch a 3rd Live TV show simultaneously, no problem. I could even pause and rewind the Live TV show I was watching.. With Dish DVR, you can't do that. If you are recording 2 shows (one on the "TV1" tuner, and one on the "TV2" tuner), then you CAN NOT watch Live TV AT ALL. The act of recording essentially TIES UP the each tuner.. This is a HUGE drawback, and if I had known about it in advance, I might have stuck with Cable. I don't want to have to plan my evenings around what's on Live TV, versus what I want to record. I often record two shows at once while watching TV. DVR recording is supposed to happen "in the background", it's not supposed to conflict with the same tuner(s) that you use to watch TV. They should be *completely* separate.. I can't stress that enough. This is inexcusable.. In fact, I specifically asked Dish if you could watch Live TV on both tuners, while recording two shows at the same time. They told me you can. (I have it in an email). So, either they lied, or their employees don't know their own products. Either way, I don't care. This is a BIG deal, and it's VERY poor design choice to omit this. It is a huge disadvantage over other companies' DVRs.. Essentially, because the DVR shares the tuners with the Live TV, my family now has to schedule what we watch on Live TV *around* stuff we want to record. That is SO backwards it isn't funny.. Anyhow, barring that, the rest is not all bad. The picture quality is terrific. And (assuming no one in the house has scheduled any DVR recordings), being able to pause and rewind two TVs, while watching Live TV on each, is wonderful.. The menu is a little clunky and unintuitive. I often find myself having to start over or hit Cancel, because it turned out what I wanted was in a different part of the menu.. It also seems rather silly, but as high-tech as it is, this thing still complains when it can't find a connection to a telephone landline. I have it connected to my High-Speed Internet via ethernet cable. Yet, it still tries to make outgoing telephone calls. None of the Customer Service options function via Internet. It just says "could not detect phone line" and there is no way for me to tell it "There's no phone, use the Internet instead". What a software UI gaffe.. I once scheduled a recording of one TV show, (I had "Once" selected, not "All", and not "First Run". I *promise*.), only to find that it had decided to schedule DVR Timers for about 16 instances of that show. I had to delete them all one by one. What a pain.. Also, it is rather slow to change channels. It literally takes ~5.5 seconds to change a channel. I just timed it, doing three trials using a chronograph. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, but it does make channel-surfing a chore. You can avoid this by using the Guide to channel-surf, but it still means a 5.5 second delay if you're using Recall to jump back and forth between two shows. Having switched from cable, that 5.5 seconds feels like an eternity. I have to tell myself, "this is what I'm giving up in exchange for the savings.". In fact, my experience with this box, in general, has been fraught with telling myself just that: "This is what I am putting up with, in exchange for the [theoretical] cost savings over Cable.". *Some of* the technology in this DVR is definitely impressive. The ability to add external storage is a no-brainer that will certainly come in handy. The ability to connect to the Internet (not an issue for Cable, since they can stream content to you via the cable - but brilliant for a satellite company) is sure to add some value. And of course, running two TVs off one box is very slick indeed. Fewer box rental fees is always a good thing.. They just need to make it so that you can watch Live TV while recording shows, on BOTH tuners. If this means adding 2 more tuners to the box, then so be it. That's what they need to do. That is what the designers of a WELL-DESIGNED, WELL-THOUGHT-OUT DVR box would have done. This implementation is a half-measure. However, it may be a half-measure you can live with.. I know there is no "perfect" solution currently on the market, and I admit, this box is right up there in the upper echelon of the "as close to perfect as currently exists in 2010" category. As-is, this DVR box could be an ideal solution for you, IF you don't mind tying up your TVs' ability to watch live shows while you're recording.. 

$$;
Pros:. record 2 HD shows at the same time, while watching a previous recorded show. Lots of space. 
Cons:. no local hd channels. 
Summary:. Great dvr and easy to use. 

$$;
Pros:. Stable &#38; responsive. 
Cons:. User Interface is mediocre at best. 
Summary:. After living with TiVo on DirecTV for 6+ years, we moved to Dish for HD, because the DirecTV DVR gets such terrible reviews. The ViP722 does the job, but it's much harder to use than TiVo.. Reliability has been very good, and after 2 months we've only had to re-boot once when it mysteriously decided not to stop showing any HD channels. It's fast and responsive, though the remote control is sluggish and plastered with buttons - we still get confused by it sometimes. It comes (at least as of Dec 2007) with a 500MB disk which records some 55 hours of HD or 300 hours of SD.. The user interface is definitely not intuitive and continues to leave us occasionally lost. The dual tuners and dual TV outputs in their default setup is simply baffling - what were they thinking? Once you switch it off, things start behaving in a sane way, i.e. being able to record 2 HD programs at once, transparently.. While it's been very reliable, there aren't any features on this that TiVo didn't do even better, and more intuitively. But for now, this seems to be the best non-Cable HD DVR you can get.. 

$$;
Pros:. A full featured receiver that delivers all that's promised. Easy to use and I like that you can connect an external hard drive to extend your recording capacity indefinately. It accepted my two terabyte box. You can order PPV using your remote... 
Cons:. Dish Network sent me four of them before I got one that didn't have a hard drive or internet connection failure within two months.. 
Summary:. I like this receiver because you can record tons of movies, documentaries, etc. that are easily found for replay with a library you set up to meet your personal style. It allows you to direct your recordings to either its built in large capacity hard drive or an extemely high capacity external hard drive you provide. Ordering a PPV with your remote is a snap with just an internet connection to the back of the receiver and I think the HD quality is superior to a cable box. HD for free is another big plus.. 

$$;
Pros:. I now own a ViP722 HD DVR, I've had it now for a week, , Pros,it works great connection between two rooms,in duel mode, the skip 30 sec ahead is great, I can rent a move off of it and watch it in the other room as well, it has a big hard drive.. 
Cons:. Cons, it doesn't connect wireless to the internet, it doesnt let you hook your Ipod to it like Tivo does so you can save and watch movies later, it doesnt auto delete recorded items automatically,Tivo is much better by far,The ViP722 HD DVR is justok. 
Summary:. I have a ViP722 HD DVR and a Tivo Second Generation DVR, if you put it side by side, even with the Second Generation Tivo DVR the VIP722 doesnt measure up. Tivo is much better, the on screen programing for Tivo is better, the VIP722 just feels like a plain Jane DVR, I'm not impressed one bit, i feel if you never had a DVR before, then you will like the VIP722, but if you have had Tivo before, then your not going to like it to much, I feel babied with Tivo, but with the 722, I feel its just a Plan Jane DVR, sure its HD, and it has a large hard drive, but when I go to purchase a movie from Dish network, it only gives you 24 hours to watch it, then it locks out the movie. And with Tivo if you record it, it stays on your Tivo till you delete it, so its kind of like ordering A movie from amazon, amazon only will give you 24 hours to watch it with Tivo.So like I said I guess Im spoiled with Tivo I feel. but again, if you want a good DVR then buy the ViP722 HD DVR, it will work fine, but you dont get the features that Tivo offers, and thats what I like, is those Tivo features. Well There you go, my 2 cents worth, take it for what you will, and Enjoy your DVR no matter what one you have!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful 1080i broadcast, or, with TurboHD, 1080p downloads. DVR works great like the earlier Dish DVR's Nothing in the feature set to dislike!. 
Cons:. Runs VERY hot - be sure you have plenty of ventilation. My first one died after about 10 days of operating (about three hours per evening.). 
Summary:. I only downrated this one because of the early life failure (no received signals from either dish - standard or HD). Luckily, it just barely made it through the Olympics. Hopefully the replacement lasts a lot longer. I had no problems over two years with the previous receiver..

Pros:. Very good picture. Much cheaper HD service than DirectTV when I bought it (and still is for my package). One ViP722 controls 2 TVs (one in HD). Very large storage for DVR recordings. 
Cons:. Unit has been unstable, and acts very weird/locks up at times. DVR programming interface is absolutely terrible, and lacks important functionality. Menu navigation is painful. Records stuff you don't want. 
Summary:. Let me start out by saying that I have a lot of experience with designing user interfaces, and have tons of years of computer experience (inside and outside the box). I am not a newbie with user interfaces.. I will describe in detail the problems I have had with my ViP722:. 1) The unit has been unstable: I just had problems today (and it isn't the first time). I have owned my ViP722 for about 1 1/2 years now. I have run into multiple situations where the ViP722 will randomly lock up / reset / freeze / or have sound only but no picture. This morning, I was surfing channels, and I suddenly saw a blank screen and channel #65535 for every channel I chose, and it was the channel number shown for every channel in the Program Guide. I had to reset the unit to clear out the issue. I have also had the unit go through multiple resets on boot-up, where it may constantly reboot for 5 to 10 times before it finally comes up. Something is flaky - software, hardware, or both.. 2) DVR Programming Interface: Without a doubt, this is the absolute, hands-down worst user interface I have seen for a DVR. I have used about 4 others (SageTV, TiVo, DirectTV, Cable), and all of their user intefaces are much better. When I am trying to record a single show of a series (Say, next week's 'Nova' episode in HD), it is almost impossible to figure out how to do it through the user interface. Do I press "DISH Pass" or "Timer"? I have actually called up DISH Network Technical Support on this multiple times, and the ViP722 doesn't handle it very well at all. I was always told by the technical support staff that the only way I could do that is to go to the Program Guide, navigate to the Channel / Time that the program was being shown, and then press the record button when the show was highlighted. Every other DVR I have used supported this functionality, and it was accomplished through the programming menu. If I want to record a single episode of something 2 weeks from now, I may have to scan through a hundred or more Program Guide pages before I get to the show of interest (if I know what day it is playing).. In addition, figuring out how to adjust specific settings for a recording is almost impossible to figure out. If I want to change a planned recording so that I start recording 2 minutes earlier for that show, I usually waste about a half-hour before I finally figure out which screens I need to get to.. NOTE: I have recently found that Dish Network's "Remote Access" via a PC works very well, and gets you much easier and more capable programming of your DVR. I no longer use the DVR programming menus in the ViP722. I only use the web interface now, and am eagerly awaiting the release of an Android App for Remote Access.. 3) Menu navigation is painful: For some reason, DISH has assigned 'secret button sequences' in order to get to some screens. For example, you may need to press the 'DVR' button twice to get to a specific screen. Useless and annoying! How was I supposed to know to press the DVR button twice? It wasn't on the menu screen, and it isn't on the remote. (It was mentioned in the 146 page manual, though). More significantly, the names of their menu selections aren't clear enough that you get to where you think you wanted to go. Many times, I find myself going back to the main menu to try again.. 4) Records stuff you don't want: If you select a 'DishPass' to record only 'New' programs, be ready to delete a whole bunch of stuff. I have a DishPass to record only new 'Daily Show' episodes, and the ViP722 will record every old episode that isn't listed with a specific original recording date. In addition, I have set the ViP722 to record only 'New' showings of a special event (Like a Battlestar Galactica TV movie), and the ViP722 will record every instance of the event. That will fill up your hard drive quickly. Again, I have *never* had these problems with any other manufacturers' DVR I have used in the past.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality, good I/O, awesome remote. 
Cons:. Hard drive reliability is terrible - I've had two die in the last year.. 
Summary:. Overall, this is a great DVR. Very simple to set up and operate. My parents had DirecTV, and they liked my DVR so much that they switched to Dish. The onscreen guide is very intuitive, and the remote is the best I've ever used. So good that I decided not to buy the multi-function remote that I had planned to get.. On the downside, the hardware reliability is terrible. In the 14 months that I've had this, my first DVR lasted 8 months, and the second one just died today after about a month of problems with the hard drive. To their credit, Dish is sending an installer out tomorrow with a new unit, but I had to talk to a supervisor to get it. Word to the wise: back up the shows you want to watch on an external hard drive rather than the internal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Access to DVR content from two rooms/TV's. 
Cons:. User interface, Programming Guide and Remote are all vastly inferior to Tivo.. 
Summary:. Dish Network does NOT know their own product. In the course of switching to this unit from a Direct Tv/Tivo I had seven people at the company, including three installers, tell me point blank that the unit would not allow pausing live TV on the two tuners and switching between them. Some of them said they'd never heard of such a thing. Some of them said that it would not do that if you chose to make the DVR accessible to a second television.. All of them were wrong and the only way I determined this was by reading CNET's review before going to the Dish website.. As for user experience, it's mixed:. Cons:. -Image quality. The Direct TV signal provided marginally better quality for non-HD viewing than Dish does. Didn't have HD with Direct so I can't compare that.. -User interface. I've used Tivo for a few years now and thought it was brilliant from the first hour. What a shame Dish couldn't have incorporated some of those principles in to their software.. -Remote. Ditto. A blizzard of buttons spread out in ways that put the controls for associated functions in awkward places and the way those buttons control those functions is frequently badly thought-out.. Pros:. -Two rooms can access the same content.. -As Tivo no longer supports two satellite inputs and so will not time-shift two tuners it's only suitable for cable subscribers, so it's no longer a solution for Sat. customers, so our only choice is between Dish and Direct TV. And from what I've heard Direct's UI, remote and DVR are even worse.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice HD DVR. 
Cons:. Only digital off-air receiver and guide features do not work.. 
Summary:. This receiver, is only a digital off-air receiver (unlike my previous 811 which had both analog and digital receivers). For that reason, I can't receive some distant stations since the digital signal is too weak (analog used to work fine).. Secondly, the integration of the local off-air stations into the program guide doesn't work. I can't tell what is playing on the local, over-the-air stations. The guide simply displays "digital service". Perhaps this is a bug in the system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. Record multiple events simultaneously. 
Cons:. Multiple unit failures. Difficulty with wireless tuner. 
Summary:. It does provide a pretty picture when it is working and the interface is simple enough. The signal from the second remote worked sporadically until someone told me how to rig a "pigtail" on the antenna. If only the other problems were so easily resolved. We are on our 5th unit and I am writing this as I sit waiting for a tech to show up. Three of these machines were afflicted with intermittent freezes, one lost all DVR function and one replacement arrived DOA. The problems are frustrating however, and doubly so with Dish Network tech support insisting that this is their most reliable unit. The tech will probably gives us our 6th box today, but if that one doesn't work, I won't have a 7th in the house.. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture quality is excellent.. 
Cons:. Very counter-intuitive. Font on remote very-very small and not back-lit. The remote buttons are not well laid out. On screen guide not well laid out and often confusing. Too many steps to record a show. The guide only goes out 1 week.. 
Summary:. Went to dish network because Versus was dropped from Directv. The directv remote and on screen guide are much easier to operate, but neither are as good as TIVO. I hope that Dish decides to revamp the whole guide/record method to make it more TIVO/Directv easy. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of storage. Record 2 shows at once.. 
Cons:. Menu is all over the place. You can't back record a show in progress. It only records from the place you press record. Tivo puts this box to shame. I feel bad I switched service and are stuck with this box!. 
Summary:. If you want GREAT DVR buy Tivo!!!! I had Tivo for 5 years and this POS Vip722 for about a year. Anyone that says this DVR is great has never used Tivo.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of good channels; competitively priced. 
Cons:. Ridiculous customer service and management. 
Summary:. All you really need to understand "******" Network is to watch an episode of "Charley Chat", a program featuring folksy Dish CEO Charley Ergin and his hokey side-kick What's-his-name. These clowns take carefully screened calls and answer questions from customers. Yeah, maybe. Anyway, when you see how lame this billion-dollar company looks, you will definitely want to consider cable or DirecTV. I prefer my executives to be properly dressed, not looking like they're on their way to a monster truck rally. And, yes, Dish Network is run like a maw-and-paw convenience store, with 3rd grade graduates manning the customer service and technical operations. This actually happened: Dish customers were having problems with their HD DVRs, contacted the tech department, who didn't have a clue how to fix the problem, in denial the whole time, and blaming the customers themselves. Guess what? The solution was posted on an internet site called AVS for a month...and customer service was still clueless!. 

$$;
Pros:. It works with Dish Network when TiVo won't.. 
Cons:. It's about as difficult to program a recording as your old VHS tape recorder, and just as frustrating.. 
Summary:. It works -- most of the time.. Setting up a recording is unnecessarily difficult. Instead of being forthright with their terms, they decided to get cute. Instead of setting up a "recording", one sets up a "timer." And it insists on recording every single episode of that program no matter how frequently it is broadcast (some cable companies will rebroadcast a show 4 times in 24 hours or more, and this machine wants to record them all. You can change it, but the default is to record them all.) And occasionally, it will decide that it can no longer find the satellites even though the satellites haven't moved and the dish receiver is still where it always was. And it will take five to ten minutes to reprogram itself. Annoying under most circumstances; but when it's the final five minutes of a football game when the teams are 3 points apart and the looser is driving toward the goal, annoying doesn't adequately describe the outage.. All in all, I'd say this is a very inferior piece of equipment. And the only reason I use it is because I can't find anything else which will work with Dish Network.. 

$$;
Pros:. Allows attachment of external HDD. Hardware specs are good.. 
Cons:. The software on this unit is the worst DVR software I have ever seen. User interface is much worse than DVR unit from Time Warner (Scientific Atlanta) I had before switching. Dish need to hire who knows what they're doing to fix this DVR software.. 
Summary:. I hardly know where to begin when describing the problems. The digital audio cuts off intermittently from the unit. The unit is not intelligent enough to allow you to watch TV on the unused tuner when you switch programs. It requires a reboot whenever it downloads the program guide. Half the time, when I turn it on, it starts looking for a satellite signal (something it could have done when it was in standby). The user interface is downright ugly compared to the Scientific Atlanta box I had with TWC. The problems are a shame, given Dish's great HD lineup and the hardware specs of this box. Whatever Dish executive was responsible for this calamity of a DVR should be fired, and they should outsource the work to someone who really knows what they are doing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Impressive Review. 
Cons:. Dish will give you their older box vip 622. The old bait &#38; swicth tactic.. 
Summary:. I ORDERED TO UPGRADE TO A VIP722 AND AGREED TO A 24 MONTHS CONTRACT. WHAT I GOT IS VIP622 (A 4 YR OLD MODEL WITH LESS CAPACITY). WHEN I COMPLAIN TO THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE, THEY SAY THEY DO NOT GUARRANTEE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE VIP722. WHEN I ASK TO WAIT UNTIL THEY HAVE THE VIP722, THEY DO NOT HAVE A GOOD ANSWER. THE BOTTOM LINE IS DISHNETWORK WILL INSIST IN GIVING YOU THEIR OLD BOX EVEN IF YOU INSIST. I WAS TOLD TO BUY AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE TO INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF THE VIP622. THE PROBLEM FOR IS I WILL SPEND ANOTHER $150 FOR THE EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE AND DISH NETWORK WILL CHARGE ME ANOTHER $40 TO ACTIVATE THE EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE. IF YOU ORDER A NEW SUBSCRIPTION WITH A CONTRACT, BE SURE TO ASK THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO GUARRANTEE TO GET WHAT YOU ORDERED.. 

$$;
Pros:. It turns on.. 
Cons:. Once it turns on and records for a while, you will note missing parts of recordings and many, many crashes, freezes and self resets.. 
Summary:. Bottom line. Dish support is told to lie and claim they "do not know of any problems". That is impossible, since all my neighbors have the same troubles with the box!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very little actually. 
Cons:. There are dozens of features that Tivo had and this DVR doesn't have. I really miss my Tivo!. 
Summary:. The bottom line is Dish TV said and is still saying that their DVR is better than Tivo. Nothing could be further from the truth. I used Tivo for almost ten years and was drawn in by Dish with empty promises and discount contracts when I switched to HD. Now I wish I had never heard of Dish!. 

$$;
Pros:. they are very nice when you give them $$ for new service. 
Cons:. they make it very hard for you when you need service. 
Summary:. Listen to me.. save yourself some frustrating times ahead and dont get dish network! Their customer support are so bad you will regret ever getting their service. We paid for their monthly equipment protection for 2 years and never used it, but when the DVR over heated, they wont send us a new one.. Oh, and, when you end service, you will need to get on the roof of your house to take down the dish and send it back. If you are not planning on getting on your roof, dont get Dish network!. 

$$;
Pros:. On-screen menus are colorful and crisp. 
Cons:. not intuitive; awkward; limited wishlist options. 
Summary:. We switched to Dish this month to avoid paying the $279 DirecTV wanted for an HD DVR. We had DirecTV's "Tivo" based receiver and it was far superior. The focus of all these machines frustratingly appears to be to record favorite TV shows. Our main use is to have it record shows we don't know exist, by entering a keyword and asking it to autorecord, e.g., an actor's name or subject. Both Dish and Direct want you to first look at what's on their guide (only 9 days for Dish and over 14 for Direct) but the only way to really accomplish this successfully is to by-pass that option and create a "timer" in Dish or a keyword autorecord in Direct. The Dish installer had no idea this could be done and DirecTV support haven't a clue either. I would like to NOT be dependent on cable/sattelite at all since we aren't network program viewers and don't subscribe to movie channels. We pick up what we like by keyword (timer) which usually turns up on BBCAmerica, PBS, or a couple of network channels. When will this technology become civilised?. 

$$;
Pros:. You can watch in two different rooms. 
Cons:. The interface is horrible. It records the same episode of a show multiple times. I am on my 5th box as the first four stopped working. Dish claims they are the editors choice on cnet yet i can't find that on cnet anywhere.. 
Summary:. The VIP722 is the WORST dvr i have ever gotten my hands on. I install home theaters for a living and can tell you this is absolutely the worst piece of equipment I have ever had to use. I WANT MY TIVO BACK!. 

$$;
Pros:. High recording time; outputs to two TV's with one receiver, allowing you to cut down cost but only in theory; RF remotes. 
Cons:. The UI; DVR recording is unsimplified; Picture on the 2n TV is horrid, so much that I'm replacing this receiver with 2 single tuners instead, and having to pay $5/mo extra for less functionality than a 722; cannot record a channel and watch another.. 
Summary:. Do NOT get this. You would be much more satisfied having 2 single tuner receivers than this, although the UI will be just as bad on those receivers, the upside is you will not have a degraded picture on your second TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Storage capacity, one box two rooms.. 
Cons:. I'm on my 6th or 7th DVR replacement from Dish!!. 
Summary:. In three years of having Dish network I've had 5 or 6 622 DVRs break. I just got the ViP722 DVR three months ago and it already broke.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture Quality in HD. 
Cons:. Customer Service. High Prices. Equipment Failure. Is not user friendly, My wife has given up on trying to use it. She wants her Tivo back.. 
Summary:. From the word go we have had nothing but problems with Dish and their equipment. I understand that you will trust CNET more than me, heck you don't know me! Just be wary when you deal with them. We were told all of these great things about the system then learn the DVR really only works in one room as HD. The other TV has coaxial from the DVR going to it so it is not a HD signal and honestly is quite poor on the picture quality. Today a Dish Network tech came to the house to inspect the DVR and I was told that due to my hard drive being about 45% full with recordings that was the reason I needed to reset the unit once a week due to the system freezing up. So I can't use half the hard drive? Well I could go off on a rant here but I wont just take my word for it and don't sign a contract with them. It is going to cost me over $200 to get out of the contract and no telling how much to get back with DirectTV. binaryluv@gmail.com.

Pros:. -350 possible hours of recording. -Dish Pass allows you to set timers for shows that aren't currently running (want to record a movie the next time it shows up, set Dish Pass you don't have to keep looking. *Possible to add an external hard drive. 
Cons:. *Only 1 hour of "pause" time (with the 522, you could pause a show for up to 2 hours). *Limit to the number of timers that can be set. *5 unit failures in 6 months (2 units were refurbished). *software is not at all sophisticated.. 
Summary:. The only plus for this unit is that it can record up to 350 hours on SD.. I'm on my 5th unit since November of 2008 - waiting for a Field Service Manager 3 right now.. I'm an "active" participant in my TV viewing. If I'm watching a show and like it, I do searches for more, others similar or actors that are in a particular show. I like to search - as I'm watching shows - to see what's on -. I could do all of this without problem on the 522.. *After a very short while - less than a week with a couple of the units, the unit slows down - more and more each time I search, set timers, etc. until it finally freezes up and shuts down. Then, the unit just cycles on and off every 6 - 10 minutes.. I had to add the external hard drive so that I could keep all of the shows/movies safe.. *This unit has repeatedly set 3 and 4 timers to go off at the same time - it's designed to allow a maximum of 2 timers simultaneously. *Often, when I check "history", it will display a show as "done" yet, when I check the "my recordings", the show is not there.. *Often, when I search with Dish Pass, it will come back with. results that are completely different - in every way - from the show I entered (for instance, a search for NCIS (exact match) brought back - "No results for Fringe"). *The &lt;&lt;&lt;Back button is supposed to go back 10 seconds.... and, it often goes back up to as much as 10 MINUTES.. *In Dish Pass, I will set a show to record in Standard Definition - no particular station - and, it will show up in the "timers" to record in High Def.. *some of the units have started the recordings as much as 10. minutes after the set time or just stopped recording before the. end of the show.. There are a number of other goofy issues.. Dish people keep telling me that the problem is electrical. I believe that it is software related or a combination of software and less than adequate hardware (it's usually the lowest bidder that gets the job).. I have 4 computers, TV, and two electronic sewing machines in this room and none of these have ever had a problem. Never blown a breaker, either.. The Dish 522 ran in the same spot - flawlessly - for about 5 years.. The 722K is plugged into an APC UPS (uninterruptable power supply) because we get lots of brown outs and spurt power failures out in the country.. Bottom line, I'm frustrated beyond frustration. I'm thinking that, "when you are a hammer, everything looks like a nail"... Dish people ALL want to blame it on electrical. If the issues is. electrical, why is the 722K the ONLY thing that is having a problem?. If you are a passive user/TV watcher, I guess the unit would. be fine.. If you like to surf/search/set timers/move things around - save your sanity and get something else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Little. 
Cons:. They have a policy of destroying your personal equipment if sent to them by mistake. They give NO notice by any means before robbing you of equipment and destroying it. They simply only apologize for "inconvenience" after a BBB complaint is filed.. 
Summary:. Once again Dish TERRIBLE Network has refused to replace or refund me for my equipment I sent to them in error. Despite my filing a Better Busines Bureau Complaint, they simply offer an apology for inconvenience. They took my personal property and destroyed it without any notification to me, in any form, by any route. I mistakenly sent my DVD recorder with a hard drive to them. It looked similar to the dish receiver I was returning to them and I just packed the wrong one. They were both out of my media tower, which I was rearranging after switching to DirecTV. They continue and adamantly refuse to compensate me or replace my DVD recorder with hard drive. They show a total disregard for other's personal property, yet would charge me without hesitation for keeping and destroying their property.. 

$$;
Pros:. Box can output to 2 tv!. 
Cons:. See Opinion. 
Summary:. I recently switched from Cable with Tivo Series 2 DVR's to Dish Network and their 722 DVR.. After having used the 722 for 5 months it is clear this box is no where near Tivo.. First at night this box needs to power down to update. Thats ok you can adjust the time, what i can't stand is the box stays off till you "Wake it back up". I see no reason for this You can't be updateing the Box's OS everynight to need this!. Second even though you can connect 2 tv's only one outputs in HD. If you have more then one HD TV too bad oh and try to get a Second HD receiver. Dish doesn't believe anyone needs more then on HD TV.. The main Items I find that doesn't make this better then Tivo:. - Can't Send Video to or from the box (TivotoGO - TivoComeBack). - No Networking. - Nightly update power down (At least turn the box back on after any updates.). - On Screen Guide frequently has wrong information. Another Item I can't get use to coming from cable is the lack of a digital display with time and channel number..
