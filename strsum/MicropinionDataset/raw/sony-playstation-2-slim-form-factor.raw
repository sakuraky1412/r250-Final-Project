Pros:. The PS 2 is an amazing system. It is sexy, and performs exponentially better than its competition. Unfortunately I have not been able to build a system that matches the PS 2's superiority (or PS 3). Fortunately for me, I am a great marketer!!$$. 
Cons:. This product has absolutely no cons. I sleep with it in my bed at night.. 
Summary:. The PS 2 can be summarized by the following:. 1. Games. 2. Sexiness. 3. Superior graphics. 4. controllers that actually fit my hands.. 5. games. 6. GAMES. 

$$;
Pros:. Games library. 
Cons:. PS3. After GOW2 no more good games. 
Summary:. Great games library.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very portable, large library of games, network ready, and same great controller!. 
Cons:. Still only 2 controller ports and could break if dropped.... 
Summary:. I love this PS2 unlike the clunky old one. If you have multiple friends or family members, this console is not for you since it only has two controller ports. Thanks Sony for this great redesign!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. faster loading than the first one. 
Cons:. Too small and flip open door instead of slide out tray. 

$$;
Pros:. Network Included!! YES!!. 
Cons:. No Cons The Systen Is Perfect. 
Summary:. This new slim look is PIMP!! and it comes with the network adapter thats hott !!. 

$$;
Pros:. This PS2 is only a little bit larger than a PS2 game case!!! It comes with the online adaptor already in it when the old adaptor was bigger than this whole ps2.Disc tray is great and its very portable. 
Cons:. None, although it would be better if it had a on/off switch rather than a standby mode. The small red light can be annoying to some.. 
Summary:. Flawless.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim and small, huge library of games, online built in. 
Cons:. None it does what it can.. 
Summary:. I hate the review for the ps2 on cnet. It's stupid, look the new ps2 is smaller than any console and doesn't overheat. Anyway the ps2 has a huge library of games since it came out in 2000 not only that it has hundreds of games from ps1. I don't know about you but I was one of 100 million that had a ps1 and I have lots of classic ps1 games.. It is true that compared to xbox and gamecube in graphics it's getting old. I look at it this way ps2 was being made to battle dreamcast (R.I.P.). They didn't know about xbox cause everyone thought it was a rumor or it was gonna play pc games only. So microsoft and nintendo had plenty of time to make their gpu's.. You know what though ps2 is approaching 100 million aswell, not bad for a system that has inferior graphics huh. Anyway ps2 is the best console for what counts, games. Xbox and gamecube can have the better graphics but at the end of the day it's all about the games and that's why ps2 is number 1 worldwide.. Exclusives like grand theft auto whose controversy just increases the sales of it and ps2, gran turismo and many more is what drives the success of ps2. I hope my review helps people see the bigger picture between ps2 and the competition.. 

$$;
Pros:. ps2 roks because in x-box uhave to buy dvd remote and its big $$$ so its expensive and so are the contorllers. 
Cons:. so in my opinion ps2 rulz. 

$$;
Pros:. I own the first edition and the second edition.(I liked the second edition better)its more portable than the others.. 
Cons:. does not have an automatic saving system(you need to buy memory cards). 

$$;
Pros:. graphics portable great selection nice features free online execllent accesories. 
Cons:. no internal memory no 4 controller interface price. 

$$;
Pros:. maybe this was already said before, but I dont think people realize what the smaller PS2 is all about. It's simply a redesign of the orginal ps2. . . that's it. i I dont think its trying to say whooo hooo we got the top notch in every gaming category. I t. 
Cons:. I would like to be able to use a 128 USB key or something similar for memory storage. (I think thats something the storage media industry needs to work on). 

$$;
Pros:. built in ether, and so what if it has 2 controller ports only, buy a multitap. its a dvd and cd player mann. 
Cons:. I scared as F$#% to break it. The game quality is the same as the orginal ps2. 

$$;
Pros:. its tiny, looks good. 
Cons:. it will get pulled off the TV stand to easily from clumsly people trping over the controller cords (needs cordless controlers). 

$$;
Pros:. on line ready, realy small, does every thing the big one does and more. 
Cons:. nothing, it is great all around. 

$$;
Pros:. I have not seen the slim console but who cares, what it has. THe ps2 is actually a computer built in a game console for people who don't know how to use a computer. Actually you would better benefit off having a bigger case because the ps2 would have more. 

$$;
Pros:. the hdd isnt important for online play, im keeping my old ps2 (scph-50001) with the hdd, and buying the new slim version for the road. their obviosly gonna make a screen got it like the PSone,also the car adaptor so u can plug it into ur cigarette lighter. 
Cons:. i dont see any cons, once the screen and car adapter come out this will be like your portable car ps2 system.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is the best gaming system out there. XBOX users need to stop giving this a thumbs down. The only thing an XBOX is good for is HALO. The PLaystation has probably twice as many games, plus if you count the regular Playstation games it has about 4 times. 
Cons:. The only bad thing about the Playstation 2 Slim is that there is no Hard Drive add-on.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Games that are actually FUN to play. -better dvd player than xbox -solid construction controller -larger game library than xbox or gamecube. -dont have to buy dvd playback kit to play dvds. -not gigantic like the xbox.. 
Cons:. -graphics are not as good as x box or game cube, but are still pretty solid, and whats the point if the graphics are the best but the gameplay sucks? -No hard disc expansion, but only like two or three games us the hard disc anyway. Other than those two. 

$$;
Pros:. PS2 is the best. I have PS2, XBOX, and Game Cube. More variety of games. Admit, you cant tell the difference in graphics i can't, so mainly you buy the system depending on what kinds of games you like. Smaller, Quieter, Fixed old problems, built in networ. 
Cons:. No HD support. Ever heard of External USB Hardrives, there will be one within a year.Who uses the Hardrives anyways? No Screen or Battery yet... but there will be.. 

$$;
Pros:. smaller ,you can carry it around and have it in your car. 
Cons:. it better than the x box a very crappy computer that has a brick for the controller and no usb. 

$$;
Pros:. I just got it, and the small sleek desing it's perfect. built in ethernet that right there saves you at least $40.00 in a network adapter. Unless you play final fantansy, there is no need for the PS2 hardrive. I play all the madden and ESPN games, and it'. 
Cons:. More likely to break, you have to take care of it.. 

$$;
Pros:. beauty. The cross between European and Japanese superb entertainment item.. 
Cons:. If you want hard disk! BUY A FREAKING PC!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's slimmer so you can store it in a small nooks and such things like that. Also it has the same price as it's bigger bulkier brother (149.99$), and built in ethernet port. Hopefully in the near future Sony will manufactor a HDD that will be compatible w. 
Cons:. Players of the popular MMORPG Final Fantasy XI will want to take a step back, it's not compatible with the Sony Harddrive so you can't play games that require a HDD.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything! First console to be compatible with the system before it...and everything else!. 
Cons:. Only that I can't afford ALL the games!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Ethernet built in. smaller and lighter. It looks like you can stack 10 of these next an xbox. No hard drive, no worry. Maybe Sony will be going the way of the NAS(network attached storage). Why should I have to buy a new hard drive every time a new system. 
Cons:. Why no slot loading (ala iMac, or powerbook)?. 

$$;
Pros:. It's going to cost much less for Sony to make this machine, so eventually this will mean it will be cheaper. PS2's are great for gaming, the BEST console because they have the best games. You can argue that the XBOX is more powerful, but the Microsoft X. 
Cons:. Nothing new at all. No hard drive support (not that big of a deal). Wasting Sony's resources (focus on the PS3, come on!). 

$$;
Pros:. I dont have a PS2 yet, I've been waiting for the mini to come out. Its so much smaller. 
Cons:. Oh it cant use the hard drive, but Im not paying $160 (cdn) for 40 gigs anyway. 

$$;
Pros:. allot of games built in dvd/cd player internet. 
Cons:. less graphics then the xbox. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Controller , Slim Factor very nice , The best Games of past generation , it just gave us so many great classic games, Mteal Gear Solid 3 , God Of War 1 and 2 , Gran Turismo 3 , Fatal Frame, Devil May Cry , Final Fantasy X , Ico,......etc. 
Cons:. Limited DVD capabilities .....but seriously ,......all the cons that it has are washed away by all the great moments it gave me ....if it were not for the Snes this would be the best console ever. 
Summary:. Great console , Sony please manage to bring the magic back ..... 

$$;
Pros:. Small size. quieter. the amount of available games. 
Cons:. no hard drive compatibility. 
Summary:. The ps2 slim is one of the best gaming rigs out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of game choices, some very popular titles. 
Cons:. Lacks the "party" style of the Nintendo systems. Most games only 1 or 2 players. 
Summary:. A good choice for newbies to gaming systems. 

$$;
Pros:. user-friendly, great games. 
Cons:. older, not the best controllers. 
Summary:. I really love this system. I have since it came out. There's nothing bad I have to say about it, asside from the very awkward-shaped controllers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Game selection, works with PS1 games. 
Cons:. Starting to seem old compared to PS3 and xbox. 
Summary:. For a casual gamer this is a great system, available cheap and the selection of games is astounding.. 

$$;
Pros:. save yourself $600. 
Cons:. may take a few weeks, but it is free. 
Summary:. follow this link and the instructions:. http://www.YourPS34free.com/index.php?ref=4372466. I have already received 60 gig ipod by doing this, and now I want to get my PS3 before Christmas. you can too free and easy.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is very small and compact also lightweight, It has a flip open disc tray (like a gamecube) and you can't get your game jammed in there if your power supply breaks, it fits into any home setup. 
Cons:. Probably would break if it was accidentally dropped from 6 feet or more because of how thin it is.. 
Summary:. I recently traded in my old standard ps2 and bought this new slim one. Boy, am I happy! It is so light. I travel to my friend's houses and bring my Xbox 360 and my new slim ps2 and it is so easy to take with you. Also, it looks nice and slim like a compact dvd player. It is no bigger than a hardcover book. It is thinner than a book, but about the same length. It is very quiet while playing, also it has a flip open disc tray. This style lets you control taking out disks rather than the console actually pushing the tray in and out. Great upgrade and outstanding value!. 

$$;
Pros:. Tiny and low-weight is excellent. 
Cons:. No one yet - Or even too small when I pull on the controller the console come with me.... 
Summary:. Even offer a USB key entry. The PS2 should have done that small at the beginning.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, great library of games, cheap.. 
Cons:. Top loading disc tray feels flimsy, cords can be cumbersome.. 
Summary:. The slim form boasts a definite cosmetic improvement (including a silver version if you're tired of black), taking up less space at the expense of an additional cord. The only flaw is the disc tray, which loads from the top. The door opens at a very narrow angel, making it difficult to put in the disc especially if you have large hands. The door also feels like it can easily be snapped off with an accidental jolt of the hands.. Aside from the cosmetic difference, the machine still performs the same. The real appeal of the PS2 is its impressive game library and cheap price. If you've never owned a PS2 before and are interested, pick one up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays DVD's andCD's, huge library ,great games such as the gta seires, free online. 
Cons:. low graphics, crapy online and old gen.. 
Summary:. The ps2 was one of my favorite systems. it brought the gta games resident evil games and tomb raider (legend not the other one)games back to life and allowed you to play dvds! it is a huge step from ps1 and proves once again that Sony knows what there doin!. 

$$;
Pros:. very small and lightweight, tons a games,. 
Cons:. cannot be placed vertically without stand, has a cheap door, nex gen consles are going to kill it soon. 
Summary:. The ps2 slim is a very nice, good looking very small compact system. Although, the door isn't very good, mine got accidently ripped off from my little brother, it wouldn't work after that. I can't wait till the new colors come out late this year, alien green, powder blue, blue, pink, and other colors aswell, with matching conrtollers and memory cards. Also the price is going down to $100 and games are only going to be 9.99-39.99 dallors by autum. I would reccomend this consle, but it's going to be dead soon from nex gen consles.. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics, game selection, built in ehternet ports, quiet, hardly ever freezes. 
Cons:. Flimsy top tray, clunky power converter, Sony missed a good chance to par up with the Xbox in this redesign.. 
Summary:. Sony did a great job downsizing the Playstation, we bought this slim model after our first (larger model) one stopped reading discs. We've had this PS2 for a little under a year, and it has hardly ever frozen. The library of games is expansive, and the Greatest Hits titles are a great price. With the release of the PS3, newer titles such as Madden are sure to drop in price. Internet setup seems to be easy with the built in ports. I don't like the top-loading tray, it's flimsy, but with the console being so small, it'd be hard to put a stable tray in it also. Also, the power converter can get hot, but it has never posed a threat. The only problems that the PS2 really has are because of how much it is hindered by its size. They could've also matched the Xbox's capabilities with this redesign.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great selection of titles, backward compatability with Playstation games. 
Cons:. Not able to play HDD enabled games. 
Summary:. The PS2 is an intuitive and breathtaking console with a killer price. Its small form makes it perfect for the dorm room or the person with minimalist tastes. A huge library of games makes it a fun system for all people to play. Though the graphics may look dated by 2006 standards, those of us who look beyond the graphics to the gameplay and the true essence of the game are seldom dissapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in ethernet, large game library, compact.. 
Cons:. No hard drive slot, only 2 controller ports.. 
Summary:. PS2 is a good system for a family. There are sports and racing games for kids, and exiting shooters for teens and parents.. 

$$;
Pros:. god of war, gran turismo. 
Cons:. xbox's halo, mech assault. 
Summary:. Been out of console video games for a few years because i was taking college seriously. but wow!!! there's a lot of cheap ($20 or less) quality games for ps2. if this is what's like for ps3 5 years after its launched, i might wait for the ps3 to be under $200 to get it. and get quality $20 games.. all in all i dont really care that much about the graphic of the games. i tried to play xbox360 ncaa football 07 and playing the ps2 version. all it's different it's the graphic, and the gameplay remian the same. so, don't be a graphic fetish and you'll spend less money and still get a good gameplay. PS2 have alot of games for me to explored, beyound the launch of Playstation 3. The only bad things about PS2 is I can't play Halo, and Zelda. But I might end up getting all the current-gen console anyway, after the price goes way down (i'm talking $50 or less), yep, i'm a budget gamer!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice slim design, built-in ethernet ports.. 
Cons:. Pretty much the same as old ps2 other than size, top-opening disk drive.. 
Summary:. I got the slim ps2 because my fat ps2 broke, and I wanted to play GTA: San Andreas. Its a really great system, not much different than the fat ps2 other than the fact that its slim and has less problems than the original ps2. The top opening disk-drive seems clumsy and makes you think you may break it for how fragile it seems. Just but it if you dont already have a ps2.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ultra Small Design, HUGE Game Library, Excelent Controler, Sony is Going To Be Supporting it For 5 More Years. 
Cons:. The Xbox's Visuals and Online Service is Superior. 

$$;
Pros:. everything, except. 
Cons:. Only two players can play without any peripherals. 

$$;
Pros:. Online ready, thin, minimalist, very affordable at about $130, but maintains PS2 quality and performance.. 
Cons:. Lack of open air causes base to heat up quickly, no HDD, no On/Off switch in back. Envy, if you have already bought a PS2.. 
Summary:. This is really the most compact and practical of current-gen consoles. At 3 lbs less than PS2, it retains all the same gameplay flaws as PS2. 294.9 MHz processor is nothing compared to Gamecube (485) and XBox (733), although the Toshiba &#38; Sony Emotion Engine is better than the BM PowerPC "Gekko (Nintendo)" if at equal rates. Less than 1/2 the cache memory of Xbox and 1/6 of Gamecube. Gamecube, XBox, and even Dreamcast came online ready out of the box, so this is less an improvement, as much as it is maintenance.. The HDD slot is useless, unless you want to save your games on a hard drive and not carry all of them around. The Slim PS2 has 2 USB ports, but neither is compatible with an external HDD. Sony probably did this to cut down on game pirating, which can easily be done with HDLoader (Not endorsing pirating, it is stealing, you can be prosecuted, and it is very cheap and easy). Also, you cannot save your memory card files with the slim PS2 (requires HDD utility disc), but this can be remedied with another memory card.. Still DVD and CD compatible, though the disc drive is kind of lame. I prefer not having to bend-up my discs to get them out of the console, but it's cool, whatever. It is unsure whether the new version will actually overheat. The base will get fairly hot after 1-2 hours, but it could just be hot and not overheating. The lack of open space (which contributes to over 50% of the volume in a PS2) is the most likely cause. Having no On/Off switch in the back is weird, but I like the idea of making the Reset and Eject buttons blend in with the ridges.. All in all, if you have already purchased an XBox or Gamecube and want to try playstation, this is a good console (actually, the only console). Its only real difference from the original PS2 is being compact. An online adapter can be bought used for $0.99 at EB. Online experience is horrible though. It's not as bad as Nintendo's, but XBox love leaves everyone else in the dust. If you don't already own a playstation product, the games are a perk. Seriously, what's so special about Halo (Interactive Star Trek) or Smash Bros (It's alright, I guess)? Madden and Kingdom Hearts is where it's at. Also, XBox and Gamecube controllers suck.. 

$$;
Pros:. The de-facto console for this generation. 
Cons:. Weak online. 
Summary:. If you can only buy one system there is only one choice as to what to buy: PlayStation 2. While it maybe not have the best graphics, it has without a doubt the best library of games over all the genres. If you are wonder what system will "likely" get a particular game you can easily assume PS2 will get the game. The systems only flaw is ist online functionality. The lack of an "integrated" online service is unfortunate, but given taht only 20% of console owners currently have broadband though and ISP its is easy to see why such a function was a low priority this generation. With that said some of the most popular online games ever appeared on PS2, so it hard not to admit Sony did exactly what it needed to and no more.. Finally, if you are reading this you are likely in the market to buy a PSTwo, so I will just say go ahead. Unlike XBOX or GameCube, the Sony PSTwo will see continued support for the next few years. Even now the system is a worthwhile long term investment.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim, plays DVD, good graphics 2 USB slots.. 
Cons:. needs external power source, controllers not wireless.. 
Summary:. fairly good,small console, fast load times.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim design. 
Cons:. gets hot, the fan gets kinda loud. 
Summary:. Its a great product. The slim design is soo much better than the large version. It gets hot but this is a common problem in alot of game systems and other electronics. My fan is getting loud but its nothing to bothersome. Plus I'm sure if you actually clean it once in a while you'll be fine. Its brought me hours and hours of entertainment. It plays ps1 and ps2 games, cd's, dvd's you can't really ask for much more. I choose it over nintendo and microsoft becuase of sony's great reputation and I am not dissapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. No overheating. 
Cons:. when you find some tell me. 
Summary:. Well the ps2 is definatly one of the best, the graphics are awesome, and the gameplay and sounds of the games are very good, i would also suggest waiting for ps3 before getting a xbox360. 

$$;
Pros:. Small not bulky like a xbox and portable. 
Cons:. No room for a Hard Drive. 
Summary:. I think this is a great product. You dont need an expansion slot for a ps2 unless you want faster loading times. I can't wait for the ps3 though it has a blue ray disk reader and the media is 54 GB!!. 

$$;
Pros:. slim body, wont overheat, portability, large collection of games to choose from, small controller that would fit snugly into even small hands. 
Cons:. the top loading disc tray, only two players, virtually impossible to make it vertical. 
Summary:. Okay, I'm a PlayStation fan, and I'll admit it. But PS2 is the best console in terms of power, size and choice of games. There is no other console that exceeds the library of games available for PS2. Its really slim; it would fit inside a backpack easily if you intend on bringing it around. Its controllers aren't as big as Xbox's (especially the first ones - it was huge!) While some might complain that its processor speed is too slow or its graphics aren't as good as Xbox, think again. Xbox might offer you a better graphics, but you pay, as a consequence, the size. You can't make it stand upright; it would fall on itself. You have to put it sideways - and it takes up a space comparable to a 17" widescreen laptop. Which is more useful - a laptop or a Xbox? I think the answer is obvious. Although I do like Halo and Halo 2, that's virtually the only good games I like on Xbox. Mind you, I like all sorts of games but...there isnt a lot of games that captures my eye on Xbox.. But there is some flaw to the new slim PS2. I just plain hate this top-loading disc tray. It flaps open when you press the button. This makes it virtually impossible to make it vertical, 'cause the disc would fall out every time you open the flap. Its best enjoyed lying somewhere safe where it can't possibly topple over. I also don't like the fact that there is only two controller slots; its boring to play against your brother all the time, even if my friends are over - they can't all join in and play together. But I still like it, and I'm anxiously waiting for the launch of PS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of Games in all Levels. 
Cons:. Outdated Graphics. 
Summary:. I have nothing against this fantastic console, just in the Graphics Department compare to its neighboring Xbox which has a lot of processing power,733 Mhz vs. 299 Mhz But when it comes to games PS2 has no competition at all !. See it for yourself visit your nearest video game stores : ) sometimes its not only the graphics count.. Bro. Junn. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, all the same games as the PS2, dvd, online games, portable, easy to plug-in.. 
Cons:. only 2 controller slots. 
Summary:. The new PS2 is just as good and fun as the old one.. 

$$;
Pros:. ultra thin, light, quite, small and NOT bulky like the last, intergrated eithernet / modem, USB headset ports, optical audio out, P-Scan. 
Cons:. no hard drive slot, top opening, external power supply. 
Summary:. If you don't already own a PS2 then buy this sucker, it's still a great gaming system and runs all games except for final fantacy 11 I think. If you already own a PS2 and it's still running fine don't bother getting this one, as long you're happy with it or if you're a final fantacy player. It also has built in IR for the playstation remote so you can watch your DVD's.. 

$$;
Pros:. easier to carry around and hide. 
Cons:. can not play Final Fantasy XI. 
Summary:. i love it the wide variety of games the graphics the options but only the one problem no place to put the 40g hard drive in to the new one there is no place to put it.other then that it is the best. 

$$;
Pros:. Smallest console on the market, much quieter than original PS2, no slot loading drive than can mess up, built in networking. 
Cons:. same old PS2, no improvements inside. 
Summary:. If you have no PS2 but have been considering one, this a great time to get one. This PS2 is far quieter than the original. Just as i was building a "muffler" for my old PS2 i saw this came out, and since i have 2 places where i play my PS2, i thought it would be nice to have 2 PS2's so i got it and now i love it. It's so portable you can bring it to friends houses easily without worrying about it. Its a little more of a pain to put cd's in since you have to depress them on the spindle, but it's more reliable than the old one with the motor that slides the cd trey out. In addition, this one includes networking, so i can get online and play my games too! no need for any add ons or pay services like the Xbox. Still just as fast but the quietness really makes the gaming experience better overall.. 

$$;
Pros:. slim. no disk tray, built in ethernet. 
Cons:. no HDD expansion. 
Summary:. I bought 2 of these slim PSTwos. One for my bro @ christmas and one for me 3 days ago. No overheating problem. The poer inverter is on the CORD so that removes one heating element. The other is the new flip lid disk tray. I like it much better. Less heat and moving parts is always a good thing. Still not as powerful as my xbox or GC byt still has the best games.. 

$$;
Pros:. And thats a goodthing since you have other consoles whole have no lifespan like the one made by gates.Sony is a really good brand.. 
Cons:. none.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, extremely quiet, left it on for 24hrs and no problems. Best of all it has a 1 year warranty. The old machine had only 90 days.. 
Cons:. None. 

$$;
Pros:. Wow, can you please purchase or use a product before you rate someting. The new slim PS2 is very nice and is not only slim but a nice upgrade. My old PS2 was so loud and the slim one barely makes a sound. So many trade in stores are running good deals. 
Cons:. Loading a disc is now on top and it's very fragile feeling. I dropped my controller and the whole thing fell off my shelf. Worth the upgrade.. 

$$;
Pros:. they can put all that power in a miniturized PS2 case, imagine how powerful the PS2 would be if it were the size of the Xbox.. 
Cons:. it looks a bit fragile. 

$$;
Pros:. It's small, compact, light, built in network adapter, usb closer together, top loading. What's not to love about the new PSTwo?! Also the price MIHGT be cheaper!! Also the all in one board they created makes for more profit and who dosen't love to see Son. 
Cons:. No support for HDD drive Sony released.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim and yes i can carry on my backpack and it fits perfectly in my CIVIC with 4 tvs its perfect. 
Cons:. yes i can break easy but still hella tight. 

$$;
Pros:. It is extremely portable, with an internet connection, the largest selection of games, the coolest looking controllers, and the only thing that you can play games that make you excersise.. 
Cons:. Only two controller ports, and no internal memory.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very nice and slim makes u look like a millionaire. 
Cons:. but whats the point and whats the difference besides the looks , at least if it had EVENbetter graffics then i would buy it but no way i love my oringinal ps2 peroid!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, so it makes it ideal for places you usually wouldnt see an XBox - cars, motorhomes etc etc. Very ideal.. 
Cons:. No hdd :-(. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. No harddrive.. 
Summary:. if you like to game get this system. Everything is good about it and games for it are really cheap. @5 for Madden 08. Also awesome graphics. But if you have the extra money get a 360 or a PS3 because it is kind of old. 

$$;
Pros:. Form Factor, Game Library, Continued Support, Backwards Compatible, Great Included Joystick. 
Cons:. Top loading Drive, No included Memory Card, Temperamental DVD Playback, Lack of Internet Features. 
Summary:. Great buy. Near perfect product, with a large selection of good and great games. Online options are decidedly underwhelming, but many choices of great games otherwise.. 

$$;
Pros:. Runs smoothly, runs -cool-, and the graphics are very nice. 
Cons:. Can't think of any at the moment, past the want of even better graphics and performance.. 
Summary:. Overall, the PS2 is pretty great, but not awesome. Can't really name anything I specifically feel it lacks, but it fails to be really overly impressive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large game selection, compact design &#38; style. 
Cons:. Just 2 controller ports, no compatable hard drive. 
Summary:. Hello, my name is Cesar. I had purchased this console so that I can enjoy available console games &#38; entertain my friends with a stylish system.. This slim line PS2 is great. There are so many games available for this system, I am flat out impressed. The format is ultra compact, which is useful in my living room. When I purchased my PS2, it also came with a vertical stand (glow stand). Once mounted my PS2 fits nicely beside our television stand. I am also amazed at how well this small system performs. I have had the slim line PS2 for a number of weeks now, and no overheating issues as of yet, although I have not put it to DVD use yet. I understand earlier Play Station systems had a problem with over DVD use? Finally the PS2 looks sweet, and with great controllers its modern design and a stylish exterior make for a very impressive combination.. I would not expect such a compact system to have a hard drive, or many more controller ports, it is in an understandable condition. Those options would be nice though. I also understand that some other systems can claim to have greater graphics, to some extent.. I feel this system has nicely delivered what I had expected, and more. For those considering a new console; I recommend this Play Station 2 Slim Line. I also figure the game SOULCALIBUR III should come standard with the system, if you know what I mean.. Cesar..

Pros:. graphics, speed, reputation from company and system, has had stronghold on gaming market for 6 years, disc drive. 
Cons:. load time, controller amount. 
Summary:. The playstation 2, has brought us some of sony's greatest moments, modeled some of the best mascots, and is pretty darn' fun!. The Play Station 2 offers many likeable features. For one, it has had a stronghold on the gaming market for over 5 years, although it's load time can be slow, the graphic quality can suprise you, especially if you are an Xbox user. The PS2 tooks it's step in the 6th generation of gaming, and allows intense gaming. Although, gaming is evolving rapidly, and since so the PS2 was created in 2000, where the Microsoft xbox and GCN (nintendo game cube or game cube network) was released a year later, and took a different hold. For example the Gamecube had alot of young gamers interested because of the high amount in E games where the PS2 does have, but not as many, which is not suprising for Nintendos stradegy, (a good one I might add) and the Xbox commonly known as a computer undercover, had better graphics. Although the PS2 has been prefeared by lots of RPG gamers, and action adventure sci-fi ones, and is the home for the Final Fantasy X, Kingdom Hearts, and more. I give this console an eight for it's sturdy gaming. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim, tons of games. 
Cons:. Dated graphics, need a memory card. 
Summary:. The PS2 has come a long way since 2000 when it was realeased. The main strength of the console is down to the sheer number of games and not its graphics, but there are a ton of quality games for the platform which have a wide range of genres thanks to the hefty Japanese developers support. The XBox is a great system but doesnt have the wide range of games the PS2 has, that is the bottom line games make a system not powerfull hardware.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's worked for more than three months, no longer chunky, network adaptor built in. 
Cons:. Loud, Top load. 
Summary:. After going through 4 of the old style PS2's in the span of a year I was beginning to think that my gaming relationship with Sony was over. But I ran into the probllem that I still had a couple dozen games sitting on my shelf that I just coudn't play because PS2 #4 had just crapped out on me. Frustrated I returned it to Best buy with the trusty replacement plan and they gave me the new slim one. My first thoughts were "Oh great... Now it's a more breakable POS". But I have been much happier with this one. I got it around January and it's a good 7 months later and it still works like the day I bought it. This doesn,t mean that this unit is infinately better than the old one, Though smaller it lacks a disc tray but goes for a top loading instead. I really wouldn't care to much about that if there wasn't a useless button on my remote that I paid $15 for. My only other problem is how loud the system gets. Maybe it's just mine but when it gets spinning (Mainly on blue discs) it sounds like a plane is going over my house. I still have my doubts but hopefully I will have an overall better experience with this than my previous Sony hardware.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim Design, Huge Library, Built In Ethernet, Enhanced Graphics, Use As DVD Player, Cheaper Price. 
Cons:. Only Two Controller Ports (Again), No Wireless or Bluetooth, Graphics Still Trail XBox. 
Summary:. Going away to college I needed a gaming system that had A. Affordability B. Portability C. Plenty of Titles Available. With the advent of the PSP, it would seem that the "Slim" PS2 would be come non existent, however the PSP's price ($250) for a college student and ability to play on a TV monitor have its drawbacks. I'm not saying the new "Slim" PS2 can stack up stat or feature wise to the PSP or even the upcoming PS3, however it is a great system for the money, especially for the gamer in need of space and price.. 

$$;
Pros:. reduced size &#38; weight , very cool, very quiet, fewer moving parts ie. top load. 
Cons:. front buttons can be hard to press due to size, did away with the blue LED on front and power switch on rear. 
Summary:. I bought the new slim line PS2 immediately when it was released and sold my original PS2 in the process. I could not believe how much smaller sony made it, I love it! Sony did the same thing with the original playstation then the smaller "PS ONE". I wish Microsoft would do the same w/ the XBOX for big black is a pregnant elephant compared to this mini system. I agree, the price needs to finally come down to the 100 level though. Thanks Sony!!... now if only we could get slim line colored PS2s. 

$$;
Pros:. slim, lightweight, A lot of games. 
Cons:. graphics can be glitchy. 
Summary:. i love this product i would very much recomend this product to a friend or family. And i Can't wait until i get my hands on the new psp!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small,nice looking. 
Cons:. still a slow ps2. 
Summary:. If u have a xbox this is a great additional system. 

$$;
Pros:. The PS2 (Slim and fat) DOES have online capabilities. You DO however, need to buy the accessorie. It also has some SECRET stuff. Like a mouse, (like a computer) extra A/V/ cables to go into an extra (a.) T.V. set (b.) Recording device, a headset, (microph. 
Cons:. Has about 6/8 the graphics of an xbox, which doesnt mean much.. 

$$;
Pros:. i love the pop-up disk and it is small and light...easy to transport and its much faster than the p.o.s regular one i bought in 2001 I also like the built in networking adapter :where would the other one fit on this thing lol:. 
Cons:. sacrifice the harddrive and the old multi-tap :grumble: and i cannot play any burned dvds...so far.... 

$$;
Pros:. slimmer to fit anywhere, great graphics, and internet built it the best library of games out there. 
Cons:. the new accesorries, xbox and game cube suck they have no good games really the game cube is for 5 year olds and the xbox is for people who like queer games such and the fake halos play real games on ps2. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller design, built in internet adaptor, cool design, high quality DVD player, huge gaming library. 
Cons:. No HDD support. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in Ethernet Port Fits into cramped spaces WAY lighter than it's older counterpart. (I still like PS2 better than XBox, considering that I only play one game on XBox.). 
Cons:. Can't Install HD More fragile (For those who have the old one with a network adapter: You don't need to buy this PS2 since it's basically the same unless you REALLY need the space.). 

$$;
Pros:. Slim design. PS2. Built in ethernet and digital out. I finally bought a ps2 after owning a Gamecube and Xbox for years. Compared with those to systems the PS2 is really antiquated. It's worth the enter price though to play the trove of GREAT greatest h. 
Cons:. Can't add the hardrive. Only important if you want to play FFXI. Not worth the upgrade if you already have a PS2. 

$$;
Pros:. Who cares. 
Cons:. Read the bottom of the page where it says "Feauters" I find that hilarious... it says vibration..lol... quick, hide the kids.... 

$$;
Pros:. Has Digital Out standard unlike XBOX, has DVD support unlike XBOX, has (normal) USB support unlike XBOX, is quiet unlike XBOX, is small unlike XBOX, has support neat remote unlike XBOX.. 
Cons:. Insulting the PS2 inferior graphics, 2 controllers, need for a memory card etc is silly. The PS2 is older, most people do not use 3+ controllers and if you own a PS2 then you have a mememory card. I own both and I like both.. 

$$;
Pros:. Smallerm has a built in network adapter, plays burned dvd's.. 
Cons:. more fragile and is freekin out of stock everywhere &gt;_&lt;. 

$$;
Pros:. slimmer, lighter, snazzier. built-in adapter. quieter. cheap!. 
Cons:. no hard drive (but of course this will be remedied soon).. 

$$;
Pros:. The same great PS2 we know and love, just upgraded. It has several upgrades, both software and hardware.. 
Cons:. If you already own a PS2, there is no good reason to get another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. How can anyone say it breaks easily or isn't well built? Have you USED one? No. Don't comment on things you know nothing about, it just makes you look stupid. It'll probably turn out tobe one of the best-made PS2s simply because of all the revisions that. 
Cons:. Apparently the current PS2 multitap won't work with the revised PS2, which seems like a stupid move. The lack of a HDD isn't a problem for most, and the idiot that said "Also, hardrives are very important to online gaming. And the ps2 is not compatable. N. 

$$;
Pros:. I refuse to testify on the grounds that anything I say will make the PS2 look good.. 
Cons:. The only product con is me!. 

$$;
Pros:. The new slim-line PS2 looks so cool when compared to the hulking giant called Xbox. Slim is in!. 
Cons:. I'll have to buy two; one for my bedroom and one for my living room.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small form factor fits in even the tightest space. Built in ethernet eliminates the need to buy a bulky adapter. The new PS2 isn't designed for portability, its designed to conserve space in parts of the world where space needs conserving. By upgrading th. 
Cons:. No 802.11 built in.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good games, compact design. 
Cons:. 2 player only, graphics are so-so. 
Summary:. I got this system because I wanted Guitar Hero 2 and my sister wanted DDR. I am very happy with the game and pretty happy with the system. Its a good system if you don't like the Wii and don't want to shell out $600 for a ps3 or $400 for an xbox360.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price!!!!. 
Cons:. No problem at all. 
Summary:. I just have one quiestion, Can I use playstation2(slim) for 6 or 7 hours with no problem?. I mean, Do I need condition air or some kind of ventilation machine for de PS2?. 

$$;
Pros:. Extensive Game Library, Plays PS1 Games, DVD Capabilities. 
Cons:. Low Detail Graphics, Load Times are Long. 
Summary:. The PS2 swept the gaming world when it came out. It was the first system to push the envelope for higher 3D performance and it remained one of the top consoles for a half the decade. Since the PS2 has been around for a long time, no real updates have been made,.. the Gamecube and XBox reign supreme in visual quality because they were releasesd afterwards.. Still, the PS2 offers tons of hits, like GT4, the whole Grand Theft Auto series, and the Final Fantasy franchise which lured me in to buying the PS2 in the first place!. The PS2 gets my "7" because it's good for the time being, because Sony is planning on releasing the PS3 in the future. The new models are now slimmed down, which makes this a cooler purchase.. If you're demanding higher detailed graphics, and have the money, choose the new Xbox at the moment. If you want some quick entertainment and want a huge collection of games, get the PS2. It's a matter of choice!. 

$$;
Pros:. nice..It is smaler then the xbox and that is a good thing.. 
Cons:. it only have two player ports &#38;sone of the games dos not have more than two players. some games dos not have that much levels!. 

$$;
Pros:. online gets kds to get more updated with the future of pc's. 
Cons:. A little to expensive. 

$$;
Pros:. Ps2 pro's: Really small. Not huge like xbox. Flip up cd tray. (Also the new design prevents vertical standing of the unit. A design flaw which damaged discs in the previous design) Built in Ir, ethernet, pretty much saves you buying the little accessories. 
Cons:. No hdd. But nothing is going to use it anymore anyways. You could use it with ff11 or That resident evil game. ff11 is availible for pc and the resident evil game was not that great. Costs too much. Should be a trade in offer through sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. better to hide otherwise same as old ps2 built ethernet port. 
Cons:. trying to cop-E xbox with the ethernet much easier to break. 

$$;
Pros:. Although Cnet is totally in love with the xbox for obvious reasons, the fact of the matter is xbox has no games worth playing besides halo 2, because of its multiplayer capabilities. The funny part is more people play ps2's Socom II online, than do people. 

$$;
Pros:. looks cool.. i dont have the old ps2.. so im thinkin of gettin this one. so wats so good and wats so bad? can u play dvds.. does it overheat? will it give me "disc read error"?? gimme some input. 
Cons:. i hear it overheats? and fragile? has anyone broken theirs yet? can u hook up ur internet and then play online? or u need to buy extra stuff? i need help cooldude_gk@yahoo.com. 

$$;
Pros:. This looks great with any TV, and if you travel its great to put in the carry on. I have an xbox after selling my PS2 but still plan on buying this.. 
Cons:. no room for mods. same ol' same ol'. They could have added maybe a battery pack or something cool like that with a screen to give it a laptop like feeling. 

$$;
Pros:. yes, the xbox has better graphics, but who cares? gta san andreas is only coming to the ps2 and think about it - why do more people have a ps2 than a gamecube or xbox? cuz it has the largest variety of games - consult ANY good electronic gaming magazine a. 
Cons:. im just waiting for the lcd screen to come out so i can play in my car :) u know wut? u can mod an xbox to play ps2 games as well..... 

$$;
Pros:. The last editor obviously doesnt use his psII much as it does have a hard drive option. Actually the new maps for Socom II (a game I play often) are only an option if you have the HD.. 
Cons:. I do think the games are better look better on the xbox but isnt that just a pc with different controllers... 

$$;
Pros:. Easier to fit in small places so you can hide it from your little sister/brother(s).. 
Cons:. It is much easier to break than the PS2 (original).. 

$$;
Pros:. Good games. 
Cons:. Cant be repaired. 
Summary:. I had bought a PS2 about 2 years ago. I dont know but some problem occurred in it. I went to the Sony service center and they said that SOny dont repair Playstations. They said that if I had a warranty card they will replace it but they wont repair it. I found it absolutely weird. If you are selling something you should repair it as well. What about those customers whose PS2 are out of warranty. If their PS2 gives some problem then it wont be repaired. SO my suggestion... just as your warranty is about to expire exchange it otherwise out of warranty pariod it wont be repaired.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a smaller Playstation 2.. 
Cons:. And that's basicly it.. 
Summary:. A small Playstation 2. That's what the slim PS2 is. It could fit the size of both of your hands, it has a new 'pop up' disc tray, and everything is small. That's the 'massive' difference between a PS2 and a slim one. The shocking thing is, the PS2 uses more unhelpful ultilites, such as a guardian thingy.. And that is what is basicly is.. 

$$;
Pros:. No over-heating, thank the lord.. 
Cons:. Thinner. More of a price tag.. 
Summary:. For the money's worth your getting here folks, your paying for what could of been done by a specialized or even bodge PS2 chipper.. The techies at Sony ripped out the beast dust covered fan and replaced it with, wait for it.... Nothing.. Oh and, that really annoying whiring noise, well done, the fan doesn't make a noise. It aint there.. Also. Well done techies, you decided to take out the electronically controlled CD Tray, that was actually a good idea, it got annoying from time to time and mine got stuck in the process of retreating back.. The new PS2 includes an all labour working console, and it's bringing back the rememberance of it's dead first brother, the PSone, with the standard push to break switch controlling the shutter type tray.. Apart from that. Your paying for an anorexic PS2 with attitude and some rip off modifications.. 

$$;
Pros:. Some good Games. 
Cons:. pulls up last as far as sheer hardware is concerned, and the damn disk read error. 
Summary:. I like it, but not as much as my gamecube and xbox. there aren't really that many games on it that i care for, and the graphical quality is lacking, with the exception of mgs3. Just no that great of a machine. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, lightweight, can fit into small spaces. Has the online option built in. Works with older PS1 memory cards and controllers, as well as games. Plays DVDs.. 
Cons:. No power off button. The only way to turn it off is to unplug it. Opens from the top only, not like a cd-rom drive. When purchasing a new one you have to purchase the memory card separate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its Just Plain CRAZY I Mean You Can Store it viritcal or horizontal and its small to fit almost anywhere. 
Cons:. WUT NO HARD DRIVE i bought the 1st ps2 and the hard drive with final fansty and it wont work on the new slim PS2! NOT COOL!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. I like it's portability because I travel alot, and alot of the places I go are not vacation spots.. 
Cons:. Doesn't have a s-video hookup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Smaller, Built in network/ RJ-11 line, less power consumption, Can read video DVD-R's (original cant) no disk read error.. 
Cons:. No HDD compatability. (sony will probably make an exterior one via USB 2.0) heats up reletivly fast no fan, small vents. 

$$;
Pros:. The Sony is a reliable piece of hardware it function well reads relatively fast and plays games smoothly... Great game support from a number of vendors.. one of the strong points of the PS2 the slimmer design is nice andis a space saver for those tight en. 
Cons:. The Xbox definitely supplies the extra with better support for online gaming (as long as you have (hi speed internet) almost as larger a library of games and some nice exclusives (Need we say (Halo and soon Halo 2) This is a rating on consoles not a compa. 

$$;
Cons:. Doesn't play burnt CD's and burnt DVD's.. 

$$;
Pros:. The smaller size allows you the ability to put it anywhere you want, top loading is one less part to break versus the slot loading tray from before. I had the original for 4 years before it clunked out and wouldn't read any disk anymore so the low price. 
Cons:. No internal hard drive.. 

$$;
Pros:. price point, footprint, the massive PS2 game selection. 
Cons:. no hard drive, no out-of-the-box online gaming, but at the low price that's to be expected.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sony has made another great console. It is good for fitting in cars as it's small. Sony still has the best selection of games. For example, GTA.. 
Cons:. I assume it is too fragile. Easily broken.. 

$$;
Pros:. It looks like it won't have the noisy fan that's in the original PS2, nowhere to put it :-). 
Cons:. None! Just nothing better than the original PS2. It's not an upgrade.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim form factor. Still the same great system the world has known for many years. Built-in ethernet port. Once again Sony blows M$ and Nintendo out of the water. This maybe the oldest console on the market but its STILL NUMBER ONE!!! Done Deal. 
Cons:. Can't put in the HDD. Thats about it.. 

$$;
Pros:. good games, looks cool, better online support. 
Cons:. it's just a more expensive ps2, doesn't support HDD. 
Summary:. The PS2 is a good, albeit underpowered, system. However, there is little point in buying this version, which doesn't even support the [near dead] Hard Disk Drive.. If you're going to buy your first PS2, and you want this to look good in your living room, buy this version. If you already own a PS2, or don't care about looks, or don't want to spend a lot of money, just buy a normal PS2.. 

$$;
Pros:. The machine is actually ten to fifteen percent faster than its predessor. Everything worked faster on the PS2 Slim Even if in some cases minimal gains it was gains none the less. Oh and Networked lets not forget that ! This features is great for Driving g. 
Cons:. No HDD. Not a lot of ports (ins and outs) I think it could use at least two Cable multi format output ports(So as to not need so many outside accessories to make the PS2 Slim work properly) so as too work more effectivly !. 

$$;
Pros:. Thinner. 
Cons:. -the HDD add-on doesn't work -some of the accessories don't work -Same old PS2 in new shell, if you have one, no need to get this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Its small -Portable? Was the other PS2 hard to move?. 
Cons:. -Its small, so dont store it up high, the cord weight can nearly pull it off a surface -It has a cheap flip lid, like a Disc-man...remember those? portable cd players people used to carry around before the mp3 days... -No Hard Drive support -I cant pla. 

$$;
Pros:. OK, so it's thinner and lighter. Yay?. 
Cons:. It's still just as wide, and now with a flip-up CD-tray, you'll need even more vertical space to use it. It's not like when Sony made the tiny PSOne, which was smaller in all dimensions and, well, cute :). The PS2 still has that 80's sci-fi look that ne. 

$$;
Pros:. A more updated version of PS2. Less bugs, better drivers. It's a PS2 - no matter how crappy the specs are and how overpriced it is, it is mainstream.. 
Cons:. Price is a bit too high. Even though the looks changed, the specs are pretty much the same - lower than both the X-Box and NGC. Scratches easily. Looks like it'll break easily too, like any other Sony gaming system. I would have given it a thumbs up if S. 

$$;
Pros:. It may looks good on the outside.. 
Cons:. But the fact is, It's divided into different version whereas asian can only play japanese version.And who the hell can read in japanese ?. 

$$;
Pros:. it's small and light weight can sit comfortably on top of my vcr and dvd without hardly being noticed.. 
Cons:. its all the same i only use it to play games i dont give a crap what it looks like. plus ive got a 120GB hard drive (which this doesn't support)and chip for my standard ps2 its so much better, stick with original.. 

$$;
Pros:. ditch the games consoles and get a pc for gaming? when i can play games on a 42 inch flatscreen at no extra cost ill maybe go for it. Never seen the attraction in on-line gaming anyway. Thats what "friends" are for!. 
Cons:. ill keep my money to put towards the ps3.. 

$$;
Pros:. WOW, thinner and has ethernet port built in. Yay! Now I can carry it into my car to play!. 
Cons:. If you trade in your older model ps2 for this, YOU ARE AN IDIOT! You're not getting anything better, it's just an easier to break piece of crap. Go buy an Xbox please. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, Doubles as DVD player.. 
Cons:. Freezes on many games slow loading. Just unacceptable. 
Summary:. I only bought this to play Tekken 5 and it freezes a lot on that game and seems i cant play shinobe at all. This is completely unnaceptable. I have had this system for less than a week and I am ready to return it. Good thing K-Mart has a good return policy. Gamecube here I come, Tekken I will miss you.. 

$$;
Pros:. small portable. 
Cons:. over heats disk read error..................... 
Summary:. i have 1 when u bump it it shuts off.always disk read error. xbox blows ps2 out of the water. 

$$;
Pros:. I'm tired of these "slimmer, newer... blah...blah...blah...". 
Cons:. THIS IS SO STUPID!. 

$$;
Pros:. slimmmmerrrrr. 
Cons:. still the same CRAP. 
Summary:. ok so sony just made there other system smaller just like the ps1 but isnt this system just made even smaller than this, the psp? it has ps2 graphics, most ps2 games are coming to psp. lol its funny how sony trys to change an out dated system by making it smaller and making it so you dont need the network adapter, ill just wake up anyone who thinks this ps2 is the best... ITS STILL THE OLD 1 MADE TO SELL , ive already heard of heat problems on this little thing, its tooo skinny!, its like a starving system, give it some meat!!!, let it live.... or just buy the beefy xbox instead of getting this peice of crap!. 

$$;
Pros:. alot of games are priced $20 on the org. no extra parts to buy for watching dvds or cd music. 
Cons:. dont waste your money, the new ps2 may not last past a year. if its made like the org. ps2. does the new ps2 have the same bug as the org. ps2?. 

$$;
Pros:. Thin case is nice. 
Cons:. Need HD support for better on-line gaming and now if your old model PS2 were to break you have to send in for repairs if you want to have HD abilities, maybe they can come up with an external HD. 

$$;
Pros:. Same as the original but without the capability of adding a HDD. 
Cons:. It overheats, there is a higher chance of this PS2 buring out than the original design. Its a great concept but which SONY should have taken the time and work out the errors of this updates console.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing different apart from a network connection.. 
Cons:. Same harware spec as the first PS2(nothing special). Still have to pay each time to play online. Xbox has everything you need to play online. Plus you just have to pay once, and you can play ALL their online games.. 

$$;
Pros:. For anyone that actually cares to buy one: Built In ethernet slimmer/smaller. 
Cons:. Many!! 1)Crap Graphics,Sound,Service, Reliability. 2)The inclusion ethernet is 3 years too late-xbox always had it while Sony made people pay 50$ for adapter 3)Reduced Size - WHO CARES. Only will cause heat problems. The original wasnt that big anyways. 4. 

$$;
Pros:. Okay great. A slim PS2 with built-in Ethernet. Anything else special? Not really.. 
Cons:. Less DVD qualities than original PS2. I can buy a HDD or whatever it's called used for $20, instead of spending another $150 on a smaller PS2. It's smaller. So what? It's not like you'll be carrying it all day, so it doesn't really matter. Buy this if you. 

$$;
Pros:. our ps2 finally wore out and there aren't any out there. We have been to every store in our area and beyond just a bit. Why? You would think this time of year there would be several and they are supposedly on sale item too. thank you mabbsb@yahoo.com. 

$$;
Pros:. With the smaller unit and Built in Broadband adapter it would be great for Road Trips. However.... 
Cons:. Without Hard Drive support, I have no use for Broadband or taking it with me. I own 2 ps2's and 2 HDD's now, 1 HDD unopened because it was not compatible with my early edition PS2. Heard about this new one and was very interested till I heard no HDD suppo. 

$$;
Pros:. Slim.. 
Cons:. Out-dated, unnecessary, obsolete. Remember when Sony came out with the smaller PS1 at the end of its service life? PS2 was great years ago, but think of what the next generation Sony console will offer. Or, think about what the the Xbox already does!.
