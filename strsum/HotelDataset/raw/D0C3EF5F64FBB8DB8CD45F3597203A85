i would definitely recommend the westin for people who know what they are getting themselves into .
it is a very typical resort with all the niceties - great pool , very good food at the various restaurants , nice staff , quality rooms - especially the ocean view rooms and very kid friendly with fish feeding , parrot viewing , and food choices for kids as well .
the beachside location is superb and the beach is very nice right by the hotel .
but make sure you know it is going to be pricey and they will charge for almost everything from umbrellas on the sand , reserving canopies chairs , pool floaties , etc .
however , so do all the other resorts nearby .
there are a couple things they need to work on though besides the pricing ( which is no worse than market ) .
the wait times for tables at dinner were way too long and always seemed backed up - which meant we definitely went offsite for majority of our meals as our child did not want to wait .
( or make sure reception says you really need to reserve for dinner ) .
the pool was a little brisk but ok once you got used to it but could have been warmer .
definitely needed more umbrellas for shade near the pool as people reserved the shade hours in advance - which we did too after a day 1 mishap .
also , could have a better kid pool area with structure , slide , etc . . . .

the hyatt down the beach had a very nice kid pool zone as an example .
as said though i would recommend it if you want a nice amenity resort with only minor knocks overall and for a price i expected.
