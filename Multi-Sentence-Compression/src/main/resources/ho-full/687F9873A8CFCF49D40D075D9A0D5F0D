the sheraton kona resort is a spacious , relaxing and naturally situated resort on the shores of keauhou bay approximately ten miles south of kona village on hawaii’s big island .
the tiered architecture includes vistas of the ocean for west facing rooms and garden and bay views elsewhere .
rooms have private terraces that allow guests to enjoy the tranquil settings of the manicured grounds , two large swimming pools , and pocket gardens .
rooms are clean and spacious ( approximately 300 square feet ) with very comfortable and well supported beds , carpeting , tiled bathroom with a tub-shower combination , a spacious work desk , flat screen tv and wifi .
the entire resort staff could not have been more accommodating , friendlier or more helpful .
the sheraton kona is an excellent property that markets itself as a large resort catering to conferences , weddings , and other events .
the staff runs the resort efficiently for the large number of guests who visit .
the rooms and decor are pleasant and in keeping with a large , high volume hotel .
breakfast and dinner on the property were in the garden and ocean view restaurants with prompt and attentive service ; the views are exceptional , and the food was predictable .
the resort is self-inclusive and distant from kona village ; a rental car is the best option to see the rest of the western shore of the big island .
i really loved watching the majestic manta rays swimming on the reef from the terrace of my room . . .
