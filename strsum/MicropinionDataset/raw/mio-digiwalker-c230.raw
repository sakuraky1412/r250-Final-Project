Pros:. Sometimes, it takes you in a roundabout way to your destination. It gets you there!. 
Cons:. Nothing!!!. 
Summary:. I like it the way it is. It has been designed good! From visually appealling to functional. I like it that I can see when my next destination is coming up as well as hear it only if I wanted to concentrate on the road. You can do tricks with the device as well; tricks like putting a picture of your love ones on the screen. Tricks like playing movies. Tricks like listening to musics. You can even play some little games on it as well. Even though you can do all these things, I prefer to keep it simple. I like it to just be a GPS system. I have fooled around with it a lot and have grown old. However, I still like my old device the way it is made. It is built good!!! I have bought my device used for $45, which includes the USB cable to transfer files to do your tricks and recharge, the windshield mount, the dash mount, the unit, and the box. It seems to have been dropped before. I even have dropped it once and it is still working. The unit does crash a lot when you are making it do tricks though. So, that is an annoyance. I have had to shell out another $30 to buy a missing emergency system restore disc. I have even had to buy a car charger for an additional $17. Including gas money, I would say that it is the price of a new one! Unfortunately, the battery only lasts for about 2 hours when the device is used to its maximum potential. If I would only dim the lights, I could maybe draw that out to the advertised 4.5 hours. But, I like it always on! So, for those of you who wish to see movies on here, I would suggest you purchase a legal version of the movie, then download the movie file that fits into the device from the internet. It looks good... just not as in-your-face-life-like-high-definition; it has been compressed to view on a small screen. However, your photographs look like human beings. So, you can snap a picture of your family and keep those memories precious inside your device. When you are not driving and safe, you can view those photos. As for musics, the sound plays marvelously through the back speaker. Definitely, high quality sounds. Just don't obstruct it and you'll be fine. So, what is the first step? Buy it from a place you can trust. You have www.ebay.com, which sells used and new ones. I have never bought this item from there so I cannot advise you except to exercise caution. I got a wrong chip or two that works on my computer. One product, I never received. You just have to know this is a bargaining place. You have to deal with many used products.... Other online stores are market place for scammers. They scheme and give you a product that is an imitation. I would rate the success of obtaining a Mio C230 from these mentioned places to 70%!!! The best place to get a Mio C230 is maybe at Staples. Unfortunately, this device is about two years old so many store may have discontinued carrying it. The next best thing may be Amazon.com or one of listed sellers online. Remember, read as much as you can. I got my device from www.craigslist.org! I met the person who seems like a good college student at Fry's Electronics. Luckily, the policeman was parked about three yards away, but that is no guarantee. I have even tried to sell my Mio C230 (modified to play movies, musics, books, etc.) for $200 firm. Luckily, for me and maybe for the buyer as well, the transaction did not go through. If you are smart and read a lot and search on the internet, you can do the 'hack' yourself. If you are just a user like I am at times, you'll have to pay for the service. All in all, to sum up my experiences, I would like to offer these view points. The system sometimes takes about 5 minutes to get a lock onto your position while driving at 60 miles per hour. It takes about 2 minutes while at a stand still. In a closed building such as an apartment, you often lose the signal. It is only accurate within the street. You have to look yourself at the house numbers, however, the streets are fine. There is no lane guidance unless you upgrade to On Course Navigator 8. I was coming home and there was 5 lanes. 3 lanes led home to the left while the 2 other ones lead me else where. It did not tell me to keep on the left three lanes. The OCN8 did. That is another $65 that you will have to shell out for the upgrade. It is a fun system to have. For all the functions like spanish, german, english, british, etcetera speakers as well as male or female options and others, you cannot go wrong with this one. Just don't let your babies play with it too much or else you might not be able to have a system for yourself as well! To top it off, you can even set it to warn you of speeding. It has been reported to have traffic flow adjustments in European countries only. Happy bidding on eBay or where ever you are going to purchase your Mio C230. This is just one happy camper's review of the GPS system. Let is take you out of your way sometimes so you can see where it leads... 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, clear image and I was surprised at how up-to-date the maps are.. 
Cons:. No cons from me.. 
Summary:. I used it on a 1000 mi trip, I missed an off ramp and decided to let Mio reroute. I went through back roads, up and down hills, one lane roads and came out at my destination. I love it!! Best investment ever!. 

$$;
Pros:. everything. 
Cons:. nothing at all. 
Summary:. i love this thing soo much it works greatt. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, loud volume, great battery life, compact. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I bought this GPS unit as my first navigation unit. For an entry-level GPS unit, the price and features of this unit cannot be beat. Not by TomTom, not by Magellan, not by Garmin. There are those who need Bluetooth, MP3 player, and 20M POIs, but I'm not one of them. I live in Miami, I know where my local gas stations and restaurants are and I needed a device that would get me from point A to point B. Honestly, I look at Mio's addition of 750,000+ POIs as a gift rather than a downfall. Honestly, I don't know anyone who is going to use 3 million POIs ever in their lifetime, and the C230 has all the essential POIs that a normal person would want or need. I got it for $190 and the fact that it has TTS at such a cheap price is unbelievable. You are not going to find any navigation device anywhere with TTS at that price. Mio really did a great job with this one. If you want to talk on your phone and play MP3s while navigating, then this device is absolutely positively NOT for you. Go get a Garmin! For those of us who want a simple way to find our way, get the C230. Do it now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, Easy to use, Accurate, Has important POI's, Fast, Takes SD card, speaks street names, definately worth the money. 
Cons:. Could use some more POI's. 
Summary:. This is an awesome GPS for the price. I got mine for $130, the next cheapest GPS that I could find that speaks street names was $300. This is a great GPS if you don't want to spend over $300 for one. Personally, I think it would be a waste to get any other GPS under $300 that wasn't this one. I would recommend this GPS to anyone on a budget. I had no problems whatsoever. It could use some more POI's but it's very easy to put them in yourself.. 

$$;
Pros:. price, text to speech. 
Cons:. keyboard cramped. 
Summary:. no real big complaints, you can't beat the text to speech capability for the price you pay. Right now its only $199 at Best Buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Unit for the price..I love it!. 
Cons:. The internal memory of this unit is listed at 1 GB, but has a SD slot for memory expansion.. 
Summary:. The Mioc230 is easy to use and is quite a bargain when compared to other brands of similar features. I'm glad I bought it.. It has Text-To-Speech - A feture found only on high end GPS units.. 

$$;
Pros:. Text to speech, compact design, Strong windshield mount, Quick recalculation, Night light dimmer,. 
Cons:. CD-rom instructions- complicated, On start-up, sometimes places me in TN and I'm in OH?. 
Summary:. First of all, I bought this system several weeks ago for $134.99 at Radio Shack. With a price like this, I wasn't expecting a whole lot, but I was pleasantly surprised.. This system has text-to-speech which, in my opinion, is the best feature of a GPS. I got into the GPS systems when going out of town with a friend who had the Garmin StreetPilot that paid $500+ but didn't have text to speech. The most complicated directions became so simple by having 2 people in the car so 1 person can read the display. THis saves on the horrible directions that Mapquest and Google maps gave. Plus it will be cheaper all around by saving on printer ink and saving the environment by eliminating paper trails to each destination.. I wanted to try tts and I am so happy I bought this system. When you are in the car by yourself you do not have to take your eyes off the road because you get plenty of advanced warning of the name and distance of the next turn.. I like that the lights can be dimmed all day or automatically when it is dark outside. This means I can place the system in my windshield and not be easily distracted.. The windshield mount is excellent. It sticks and locks onto the window without worrying about it falling. My friend's Garmnin fell from my windshield several times. I have had my mount up since I got the system and it has stayed up the entire time. I take it down and put it up everytime I get into the car.. There are many different features I have not needed or had a chance to use. You can change your route while in route. You can avoid certain streets while in route.. I do have a couple of cons that would never outweigh any of the pros....as follows:. The instructions (detailed) are on CD-rom. I would have preferred a detailed instruction booklet, but this does save on the environment, too.. I find that it does not always take me the fastest route, but I have lived in this city most of my life and know that traffic patterns better. When it is a place I am not familiar with I don't care if it takes me 5-10 extra minutes as long as I get there safe.. Sometimes when I start up the system it will say I am in TN? (I'm in OH). When I click on cockpit it immediately changes to the correct place.. Overall, I am very pleased with this GPS. I am pleased with the amount of point-of-interest places it displays. I can always expand this with a flash card, but I believe it gives me enough options to choose from.. I couldn't pass up the price at $135. I haven't seen it this low since, but I would spend more for this system.. I gave it a 9 out of 10 just because I have a couple of cons...I only rate a 10 if it is perfect!! But what is?!. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, text-to-speech capability, multiple via points along route, nice screen and maps, fast recalculation of routes. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. Just bought this unit (my first GPS) Really like the voice to text my friend has one with out this capability and he is jealous. Took a little time to understand how to use but not bad considering this is my first GPS. 

$$;
Pros:. features, Windows CE, ease of use. 
Cons:. icons can be difficult to press. 
Summary:. The basic feature set of this unit is impressive enough with speed warnings, multi-stop route planning and text-to-voice as some highlights. But where it really gets cool is when you revamp the unit with other window functionality by unlocking Windows CE. THIS IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, but it can really add some nice features not available out of the box. For the great price, you suddenly get an amazingly powerful tool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pocket size, TTS, Via Points, Advance heads-up. 
Cons:. Very Little POI's, No Automatic Shut-off. 
Summary:. I have the Mio C230 for two months now. I have to say it was not very easy to use at first, but after a couple of hours, I was able to find my way around it. The Manual is 92 pages, and I think it can use some improvements. This is my third GPS, I have a Garmin C340 for almost two years, and a Nuvi 370 for about eight months; so I can say that I have a bit of experience with the Garmin products which considered to be one of the best GPS in the market. The only reason I got the Mio is the ability to add multiple stops to your final destination (Via Points), and the Mio's ability to optimize the route for you, a feature not available in the Garmin products. My girlfriend is a realtor, and she makes numerous stops to show houses to her clients; with the Garmin, she had to enter one stop at the time, which means that she might be going back and forth or zig zaging around; with the Mio, all she has to do is to input as many addresses as she needs to, and then the Mio will optimize the route and guide her around, cool.. You can enter address either by state / city / street; or you can use zip code / street; very nice feature. Any address you input will be automatically stored in the history and you can retrieve it at any time; you can also copy everything to the SD card and store it in your computer or use the data in another Mio, cool. If you don't have the address but know where your destination is on the map, you can touch that point on the map, and the Mio will take you there. During navigation, the unit will tell you the next manuver well in advance, and it will repeat it three times as you get closer, so you will have time to get ready for it. If you still miss the turn, the unit will recalculate in seconds and you are back on track.. There is also an icon for "Home" where you can store your home address, by clicking it, the Mio will take you home, a similar one is for "work". You can rename both if needed.. The detailed information available on the screen in "cockpit mode" is impressive, on the upper left corner it shows the next maneuver (an arrow going right or left), below that it shows the distance to that maneuver and the estimated time of arrival to your final destination. Next to that you have four icons to zoom in and out on the map, and to change the view from 2 to 3 dimensions and vise versa. Another nice feature is the pedestrian mode, in that mode; the Mio will take you thru the shortest route ignoring the traffic direction of one way streets. You can customize the Mio for brighter screen or to get louder if you reach a specific speed; routing can be customized to shortest, fastest or economical. You can avoid Toll roads, U turns, unpaved roads, Highways, etc.. The Text to Speech feature is also a definite plus. The only thing that I really don't like in the Mio C230 is the very limited number of POI's (about 900K), you will hardly be able to find anything in there, Mio needs to do something about that limitation. However, you can add you own POI's to the data base if you know the address. Also, the unit will not shut-off with the ignition, no big deal.. In short, if you don't need the MP3/Photo player, or the blue tooth; then the Mio C230 is the one for you. It is a great basic GPS, loaded with features that may not be available on other big name brands. Impressive signal reception, bright screen, clear TTS voice, nice design, pocket size, at an unbeatable price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice to text, Screen is visible in daylight and very nice to view at night, highly accurate within 15 ft of destination, You can add your own Poi's, And the best of all, the 174.99 price tag!!!!. 
Cons:. Battery life sucks, 2 hours max off the car charger and thats it. The 800 mah battery could have been swapped out for a 1300 mah IMHO. 
Summary:. The cheapest new entry level GPS with text to voice. You really cant go wrong for 174.99. I put this thing through the ringer for 1 week now and haven't found anything that I don't like about it besides the battery life. It will pay for its self in 2-3 months if you drive as much as I do. Go out and buy one you wont regret it I promise.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accuracy, size, text-to-speech, price. 
Cons:. Nothing worth downgrading it over.. 
Summary:. If you read the CNET review, then by their own words, you have to wonder where they got 6.7 rating. This thing works beautifully as a GPS. It accurately gets you where you want to go. It recalculates fast and dead on. Text-to-speech is a must once you have it. I'm sure CNET does not have a lot of time to play with these things but if they did they would have found that the keyboard has three settings, one that looks just like the Garmin. As for it being too small, if it has the same 3.5 in screen as the competition then the less of your vision it blocks the better plus it fits nicely in your shirt pocket. Finally, I have yet to see where a high end GPS unit gets rave reviews for its MP3 player or Bluetooth functions, so why pay for them. Just like this GPS, you would do better to buy a quality unit designed for that purpose.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low cost text-to-speech, very good signal strength. 
Cons:. no stylus, but doesn't seem to need one really. 
Summary:. This should have had a higher review rating. You can't find another text-to-speech capable device for anything close to this price. The feature set compares well with my older GPS's. The signal strength is impressive (I was getting a usable signal indoors in a three story building). I did not find the keyboard at all cramped and other than some peculiarities with the menuing system (which I'm sure I'll get used to) I couldn't find anything wrong with this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. loud voice, good routing, intuitive, qwerty keyboard, fast lock on, TTS, great price. 
Cons:. Limited POI database. 
Summary:. This unit is a great buy. I really wonder how many folks use bluetooth, MP3 player, etc; I wouldn't. The biggest selling point for me was low price, readable screen, and TTS. The routing is good so you don't have to spend a lot of time looking at the screen. I very much like the qwerty keyboard, and the search results are nicely filtered as more letters are entered; enter th, and a whole lot of non sensical letters are greyed out. This makes entering addresses very easy. It's also very easy to avoid roads through preset conditions, or on the fly. The smart zoom is nice, and minimal interaction is necessary when navigating. The POI database is somewhat limited, but they tried to keep things to the groups that you'd really need in a pinch. For example, Starbucks is not there, but how many times do you really need a gps to find a Starbucks? There's an SD slot, and GPSPassion has lots of free POI databases available for download. For 199 bucks, I cannot imagine a better buy. I played with the garmin 660, and the range of customization available on the 230 is incredible. I've read reports where others thought the user manual was too big, but it takes 92 pages to adequately describe how this thing works. The directions (not available online in the US; try a foreign site to see what you'd be getting) are very well written and seemed to anticipate my every question. After about 1 day, it's all very very intuitive. The mount is solid too; no slippage after two weeks. Finally, the unit is hackable to unearth a whole lot of additional functionality ala other MIO units.. Now, when I refuse to ask for directions; I'll finally have a good reason for not doing so.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, TEXT TO SPEECH at half the price of competitors.. 
Cons:. nothing major..well designed and superior to TOM TOM ONE and NUVI base models.. 
Summary:. A well built gps..I was amazed how quick it warmed up and fixed my position. Its compact..yet has a nice size screen. Also..the editor complained they wish you could adjust the volume easier..well..I had no problem with it. You just touch 2 times and your in the volume menu..(DUH?) Also..it has a nice feature..dynamic volume which adjusts the volume as your speed increases..you dont have to use it if you dont want to. I felt the touchpad was just fine..I had no problems. VERY easy to navigate and all you do is input a address..(which the mio helps you with this also..so you dont have to key too much)..and then touch "route to"...and your on your way. So easy..even a caveman can do it..hahahahaha!. 

$$;
Pros:. Text to speach. Feature set. Price. 
Cons:. Battery life seems relatively short.. 
Summary:. This is a great GPS. It is inexpensive and does what I need it to. I don't need or want an MP3 player or bluetooth device or anything like that. A couple of things to watch out for: off of the DC power, when it dims the screen after a few seconds it is virtually impossible to see when it is sunny out. So either keep it plugged in or set the screen so that doesn't happen and accept a short battery life. I wonder if this is the problem that cnet had with the previous version of this device. The screen is very legible and easy to see even in bright sunlight as long as the backlight is on. I have also found that it sometimes takes me weird ways around town when I already know where I am going. I think this is endemic to this type of device but don't have much to compare it to. In the end, it gets you where you are going however. Highly recommend.. 

$$;
Pros:. Text to speech, display, accuracy, PRICE!. 
Cons:. Less than 1 million POI.. 
Summary:. This GPS is really fantastic for the price. If it had more memory for the POI (like its previous model), it would be a 10 of 10.. The text to speech is great. A friend has a Tomtom One XL and was surprised this had text to speech capability at about 1/2 the price he paid.. It has a selection for fastest, shortest or most economical route. You can also select walking routes (great for NYC) and to avoid certain areas. The display is easy to customize and the voice prompts are quite tolerable.. I've read that the keyboard is cramped but I don't have problems and have paws. You don't type that much as it narrows the choices quickly so you only make a few keystrokes.. It takes a little getting used to but after you go through the menus a few times, it's pretty intuitive.. I got it from Costco.com for $180 + $10 shipping. It's a great basic GPS and perfect for my use. For $200 with tax, I don't need to get lost any longer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size, easy to see screen, very easy to use. Very nice for first time GPS user.. 
Cons:. None so far that I can tell. 
Summary:. I have a bluetooth GPS that I use with my Pocket PC but I really needed something that was a standalone unit. The MIO C230 caught my eye with its great price. The reviews I found were very positive so I bought it. The route calculations are very fast. Initial satellite acquisition takes a minute or two and stays locked on pretty well.. You can change from 2D to 3D views by pressing the up/down arrows on the display. And also zoom in and out with the magnifying glass symbols.. I had a chance to try it out in flight recently and was very surprised. I checked the GPS screen and it showed my elevation at 7 miles, 149 yards and a speed of 476 mph. Additionally it showed the streets below whizzing by. After I landed, I noticed it has a button for views from an airplane, very similar to the inflight info available on many long haul airliners.. This is a terrific little GPS and with all the features and great price (under USD$200) it is definitely worth a look.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, intuitive software, great signal, easy to use but loaded with features.. 
Cons:. Plugs on the bottom instead of on the side prevents flush mount on dash and volume buttons. Not a big deal though.. 
Summary:. It's interesting that CNET Reviewers rave about this screen and criticize the C220 screen since they are IDENTICAL! (I have a C220 as well). This GPS continues the tradition of packing in useful features and leaving out useless features in order to offer a great price. If you want MP3's and videos you need to buy a media player. This is a GPS and as such it has everything you could want in an entry level GPS and many options only found in more expensive GPS units.. In a GPS the most important features are the GPS Receiver/Chip, the Maps and the interface...in that order.. C230 has a Sirf III chip. This is industry standard and has been shown in independant tests to be superior to most other chips.. Teleatlas maps have made incredible improvements over the last few years making them as good if not better than Navteq. Of course as with any map, some things will be missing. But I have found just as many complaints about Navteq missing things as I have with Teleatlas.. Interface is easy to use, very intuitive. Considering the number of features and settings available, the menus are incredibly simple.. I would recommend.. 

$$;
Pros:. SCREEN, POI, CAMERA LOCATIONS, XTREMELY LOADED FOR THE $. 
Cons:. CRAMPED KEYBOARD ALTHOUGH U CAN TOGGLE BTWN 3 DIFF. VIEWS. 
Summary:. I REALLY LIKE THIS ONE. PRIMARY USE WILL B 4 TRIPS TO OTHER CITIES ON FOOT.. IT HAS AN OPTION OF HOW UR TRAVELING, BY FOOT, BIKE, CAR.. NOT MUCH OUT THERE FOR ADD ONS THOUGH,DON'T REALLY NEED IT YET W/ THE STUFF THAT IS JAMMED IN HERE.. GPS LOCKS PRETTY QUICK.. I'LL HAVE IT IN THE CAR BUT NOT FOR ANY REALTIME DRIVE USE. SCREEN IS TOO SMALL. YOU MUST PULLOVER. AS W/ ANY &#38; ALL MAP READING. (DAMN SOCAL DRIVERS). 

$$;
Pros:. great features for the price, ready to go right out of the box. 
Cons:. the menus are a little clumsy. 
Summary:. i can't afford to spend $600 on a big shiny GPS device with a dozen features i'll never use (do we really need digital cameras on car navigation devices?).. the digiwalker c230 works great. it seems to have no trouble connecting to GPS satellites, even through a few floors of aboveground parking garage. the text-to-speech feature is nice and speaks clearly, and the device does a good job of calculating routes. you can set it to warn you if you're speeding by too much, and allows you to set those speeding parameters yourself. it even has a speed camera feature, alerting you to known traffic cameras and allowing you to update the database with new entries.. on the downside, it is small, though no smaller than it's competitors. the screen size isn't an issue in map mode, but your default route-following view is cockpit, which uses almost a third of the screen to display upcoming turn directions and statistics. this leaves even less map space.. the other complaint was addressed in the review: volume controls. you have to sift through several menus to adjust the volume, which is difficult and dangerous while driving. the device does have dynamic volume adjustment, but it would be nice to be able to adjust it manually.. overall, a very good device for the price, with features i expected to find only in more expensive units. if you're thinking about getting the tom tom one or garvin nuvi 200, look at this first.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Text-to-speech, beautiful Screen. Compact, can fit in your pocket!. 
Cons:. Software can be a little buggy at times, no extra features.. 
Summary:. I used to own a more expensive GPS unit prior to this one that had more features. Unfortunately, someone broke into my vehicle and stole it. I needed a replacement and didn't have the money to dole out for a similarly priced one, so I settled for the Mio C230 instead.. For the money you simply cannot beat this unit. It's compact, realtively easy to use, and best of all has Text-to-speech so you know where the heck you are going without looking at the screen.. My main complaint about this unit, is that I have noticed that the software can be a little buggy and slow. When you are making a rapid series of turns that are within 50 yards of each other (like in Manhattan), sometimes the GPS unit cannot keep up with you and tells you to turn onto a road that you already passed because of the unit's slow response time. Another problem that I have noticed is that every once in a while the unit will experience some sort of "error" and have to reboot out of the blue. Fortunately when the unit does this it starts back up quickly and picks up where you left off in your directions.. Overall, this unit is a great buy. If you are on a tight budget and dont care much about media featuers, bluetooth, or traffic reports then I highly recommend this unit!. 

$$;
Pros:. inviting, easy interface; text-to-speech (!) with street names; VERY portable; generally VERY accurate; Value ! $199 @ J&#38;R NY;. 
Cons:. No easy volume control, no paper instruction manual, some categories of points-of-interest missing (no "churches" category ?),; no maps for the Caribbean. 
Summary:. I got this for $199 @ J&#38;R, New York and I've been extremely satisfied with the amazing value.. I've looked at several GPS units at widely varying prices. I knew that I would be giving up some features at the lower price point, but as a new GPS user, I wanted something appropriate to my expected usage (I was never impressed with media-playing functions).. I ended up using it to guide me around Orlando and Miami - I was new to both the unit and the city. Fantastic experience. Attractive interface, clear maps, very impresive positioning (SiRF III, WAAS), text-to-speech. The latter was so useful that I don't know if I can recommend that anyone buy a unit without it.. I was disappointed that I couldn't investigate all of its capabilities without a computer (no paper manual), but it was interesting that I was able to do all that I wanted to without it so far.. In the silence of night, the default volume can be a bit too loud. Adjusting the volume was buried a few levels deep into the menus. Not something you want to try while driving.. 

$$;
Pros:. Speech to text feature. 
Cons:. lack of more POI. 
Summary:. Bought this GPS from buy.com and used it in city so far. I find all the features impressive. I am unable to search and add point of interests as favorites.. I tried searching stores like COSTCO, WALMART but POI returned 0 results. 

$$;
Pros:. Right now, this unit is hovering around $100. Screen is excellent in the sun. Great text to speech. SD expansion card slot. Easily unlockable (it runs Windows CE under all of it). Gets you where you want to go.. 
Cons:. Route calculations not as good as Google maps, but will still get you to your destination. use common sense. Not easy to export recorded tracks but once unlocked it can export them as GPX files.. 
Summary:. For $100, this can't be beat. I love my Mio more and more. I've had it for a year now and once you get used to the sometimes clunky menus it's a fine GPS. Also, I keep bringing up unlocking it but that's the way to go with this. Once you unlock it you can do so much more.. I use it for geocaching and use MioMaps to drive to the geocache, but then switch to a program called BeeLineGPS to get closer to the cache. MioMaps does not turn off Static Navigation even when you pick "pedestrian" as mode of transport.. Static Navigation ignores your movements when you're going less than 3mph, or move less than 20 feet. This is great when you're in a car but sucks when you're walking around. I mean come on Mio, you call the unit is "DigiWALKER".. Luckily, if you use BeeLineGPS (included in some unlock packages) it shuts that right off and you can download Geocaching LOC files right to that program.. If you just want a basic decent cheep GPS, this is it. If you're semi computer literate and can follow simple copy and paste instructions and use google you can unlock it for free for even more usefulness.. 

$$;
Pros:. Low price, text-to-speech capability, multiple via points along route, nice screen and maps, fast recalculation of routes, nice mounting hardware. 
Cons:. Limited POI database, route not always optimized, slow route simulation, UI not initially intuitive. 
Summary:. I had been living with a Garmin Streetpilot III for 4 years and suffering with a bad UI (no touchscreen) and extremely slow recalculation.. The Mio C230 GPS is a joy to use compared to this older model. It has a very compact form factor, nice looking screen, different views that cover every practical view you'd need. With text-to-speech (speaking street names) and a $175 price point, this is a great deal. But it's not perfect.. The biggest practical shortcoming is the limited (&lt;1M) POI database. From what I can tell, it has many smaller, single stores/restaurants, but not many of the big chain franchise stores/shops (Starbucks, Target, Walmart, etc). I knew that going in, and you can compensate by adding POI's as you visit them. In doing this over time, you can effectively have your frequently visited shops in your own datasbase, but if you're in an unfamilar area and looking for the closet Target, you're out of luck.. Other negatives: It can tend to take you through obscure routes locally, through neighborhoods with stop signs versus expressways, etc. So far, I've used this in my familar local area, so I notice this. The bottom-line, you will eventually get there, but you may take the scenic route. As mentioned by another reviewer, the route simulation is SO SLOW, it's useless. Seems like 2x real-time! One more thing: The distance is a bit off. 100 yards seems like 150 feet to me, so you have to be prepared to turn more quickly than the stated guidance. I've found I can easily compensate. Minor quibble: I did need to read parts of the 92 page manual to understand the options - maybe spent an hour. Would've liked for the UI to be intuitive enough to not need the manual for basic operation, but this wasn't the case for me.. Bottom-line: I like it a lot and am willing to accept the compromises associated with a budget GPS in exchange for the low price. I am optimistic that they'll have POI add-on options via the available SD slot..

Pros:. Sized icons, accuracy, voice.. 
Cons:. No manual, hard to figure out some things. 
Summary:. I just bought this device the other day at Radio shack. They had it on sale for 129.99. This is the cheapest I have seen anyone buy this here. I went in the Radio Shack store not intending to buy this but the sales lady told me the price, that it was a hundred dollars off, I impulsly bought it.. Biggest disappointment is the lack of information pertaining to the device. The quick menu gets you going, but for example, once I get to my destination, I don't know how to RESCHEDULE another route without having to turn off and on the device again and RECALIBRATE. There must be a way to delete the last route or current route to start on a new route to a destination. I thought by tapping on to the HISTORY and tapping on a POI, it would take you there, but then, I find when I do this, it doesn't do it, so there must be a way to start a new route and the instructions are weak on this. I also would like to know a little more about this ADD VIA and the rest of that gig. This is my first GPS Navigator I have ever owned so my only disappointment is a weak instructional booklet. Seems like it will take me a very long time and trial and error before I figure this thing out. Another slight disappointment is the cigar lighter cord. I was hoping this came with a cord you could charge inside your house like a wall connector. Radio shack wanted 32.50 for something to add to the car lighter cord that connected to the wall. I'm holding out for a cheaper alternative. Instructions says you can hook a USB port to the computer and charge your GPS there but the guy at Radio Shack told me you needed some kind of card or download software to do this. Don't know nuthin about that though. But overall, I'm glad I bought it and happy with it. It will be challenging to get this thing on track but so far, I've been able to find a few address quite good. If anyone got some tips, lay it down.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, sound quality, ease of use. 
Cons:. No additional maps available, terrible battery life.. 
Summary:. Everything about the Mio C230 met our expectations ... except for the lack of additional maps ... and the poor battery life. I contacted Mio looking for just Canada maps ... not available and they don't know when or if they will be. There are no additional maps available. The battery is extremely poor. It loses all it's power in a very short time when on ... and even drains quickly when off! If the battery was better, I would have given this an 8 .... 

$$;
Pros:. Price, text-to-speech, size. 
Cons:. Mapping program needs some tweaks, unit lacks essential accessories. 
Summary:. I just got the Mio C230 yesterday. I played with it for a while, and I took it with me for some of my everyday driving (2 trips of 20 miles each). It is my first experience with a GPS device, so consider this a very first impression.. I bought the C230 for the price, for its text-to-speech function, and for its simplicity, all of which recommended it for a first time user.. When I opened the box, I was especially pleased with the looks and the size of the unit. It easily fit in a pocket. The windshield mount also worked nicely (despite being illegal to use here in California.). A few things, however, were not included with the package, but truly should have been. First among the missing items is an AC charger. The device has both a pedestrian and a bicycle mode, but the only way to charge it is in a car with the engine running. Other things that would have been nice to have, but certainly less essential, are a USB cable (to charge the unit from a PC, and to access the data), and a stylus (the PDF manual makes reference to one) along with a place to attach it. At a minimum, Mio should have provided us with clearer directions about how to order the correct cable and additional home or car chargers and windshield mounts. The unit also has an SD card slot, but there are no suggestions about what to use it for. Finally, I have not yet been able to find direction for getting or installing maps of other places (such as Mexico, Canada, or Europe).. Based on my limited experience, I would suggest that the user interface could use some tweaks. When the C230 is powered up for the first time, there is a process of clicking on a flashing cursor to calibrate the touch screen. I did it quickly and not very carefully, but I cannot find a way to redo calibrate the screen without reformatting the machine and losing all of the data that I have entered manually. There should be an easy way to do that. As it stands now, I have a hard time hitting the zoom buttons on the map screen, because it thinks my finger is pointing to a spot on the map.. Finally, the navigation software has some serious flaws and a few idiosyncrasies, that for all I know may be common to all digital maps. What bothers me most is that the voice navigation will direct me to turn right for the freeway exit to the I-5 or to such-and-such avenue, but it will not tell me to take the exit for "I-5 Northbound" or "XYZ Avenue eastbound" until I am already at the end of the exit ramp and merging onto I-5 North. If I did not already know where I was going, I could easily have gotten onto the highway in the wrong direction. The other serious flaw, and this may be the source of the previous problem, is that (as other reviewers have noted) the voice commands come too late. The navigation processor may give the speech synthesizer the direction "take the exit on your right in 200 yards" when the vehicle is 200 yards from the exit, but by the time the synthesizer spits out the direction those 200 yards have nearly passed.. The more idiosyncratic flaws, that for all I know may be common to all maps, are that the map seems to get confused when I am in a parking lot, and assumes that I am on a street on another block, and does not know which ways I can go when I pull out of the parking lot; the map does not account properly for the annoyance or time factors associated with traffic lights and stop signs when calculating routes; the voice synthesizer does not know how to pronounce some odd names ("La Jolla" comes out as "louisiana joll-uh" and not the proper "lah hoI-Yah"); and, finally, I have not yet figured out how to get directions that use my complex's gated resident entrance instead of the out-of-the-way public entrance (but that could also be an advantage--I know my way around my neighborhood, but countless guests and delivery men have been left stranded by Google maps and MapQuest which stranded them at the wrong gate).. In summary, after a few hours of playing with it in my neighborhood, I think that the Mio C230 is a good device and worth its price. I know that I have listed more flaws than features here, but they are mostly quibbles (that I hope Mio will notice and address in future editions) and I do not believe that I would be any more satisfied with the other entry level GPS's that are out there. I have not yet had occasion to try out the POI database or to use it to navigate to unfamiliar places, but quibbles notwithstanding I look forward to trying on an upcoming road trip.. 

$$;
Pros:. has great Canadian maps. 
Cons:. very poor USA maps just the main highways. 
Summary:. would gladly sell this unit in favor of a Garmin c550 pilot. 

$$;
Pros:. good signal. 
Cons:. meager POI database, Outdated maps, random resets,. 
Summary:. This GPS unit will get you where you are going, but so is every other one. Let's go over the positives first: text to speech, easy history navigation, excellent signal strength, internal battery, screen visible during the day. Now to the bad: horrible poi database, unit will reset itself randomly. Another thing is depending on whether you get lucky or not, you might end up with a good mounting bracket or a horrible one. One has 3 way articulation, where all you do is press a button and move it around. The other one only has verical and horizontal and you have to twist a tiny little wheel to unlock it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets you there.. 
Cons:. 200 feet off, so if you are in town or confusing intersections, you always go the wrong way. 
Summary:. I've gone 27 miles to get 4 miles from where I started. Also, instead of telling to go east/west, it wild direct you towards a town, so you need to guess which way to go. It is great for an adventure or long drive, but very poor if you are in a hurry. Pro: you do get where you want to go and it keeps your blood presure way up!. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, has text-to-speech.. 
Cons:. - Doesn't speak directions in time for you to follow them.. - Instructs driver to make illegal turns.. - Maps don't seem to be up to date.. 
Summary:. I have used this GPS for about 4 months. There was one occasion where the street name was not in its database, even though the street had been there for at least 3 years. There was one time that it did not have the address I was looking for in it?s database, even though it was a business address that had been in that location for several years. You would think they?d update their maps for frequently than that. There were one occasion where it told me to turn left either off of a busy highway where I would have literally had to cross over a median divider which is obviously illegal. Then there were multiple occasions where it told me to turn left at intersections where left turns were prohibited. In a lot of cases it didn?t speak the directions in time for me to make a turn and I wound up missing a lot of turns. All in all, there were many problems with this GPS and I do not recommend this unit at all. Spend the extra money and purchase a Garmin unit or another more reputable brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. user-friendliness was adequate. text to speech saved me dozens of times. fly-over preview mode. the only fast thing was the recalculation. 
Cons:. Satellite connection delay 5-15 min on startup. Lost signal in clear skies, urban area, short buildings. location detection off up to 200 yards. it's not intuitive for direction changes.. 
Summary:. it takes 5 to 15 minutes to wake up a look for a satellite signal on startup. once going, it will lose signal on a clear bright day without any obscuring objects, trees, or buildings. You have to buy the MIO MOOV 310 to get additional TTS voices. You cannot add anything to the product and a sd card is superfluous. software dvd for restoration and handbook only.. I bought the 320 then took it back because I wanted the text to speech feature. Honestly if you look at the mio website, they all use the Star III technology, so you're not going to get a better signal without investing in an exterior car antenna in addition to the money you lay out for the product. I'm returning it in favor of a Garmin with text to speech.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, compact and "cute". 
Cons:. Lacks POIs and the ones it has are in bizarre locations. 
Summary:. I had the MIO C310 for about a year and a half when it broke (due to my own fault) so I raced out to get a new GPS since it's pretty much mandatory in my line of work! When first looking at the C230, it seemed to do exactly what I needed it to do, and was pretty much exact with the C310 so I bought it (price was decent). Well, now that I've used it for a few day, not so happy. The GPS itself is great but the POI listing is terrible. Again, another important feature to have in my job - but why the heck do I want to go visit some random electronics store 200 miles away from my current location? So basically, it seems that you have to know your POI before you go, then plug in the address because this GPS is not going to help you find it.. If you're new to GPS and don't care about points of interest, then buy this - it's worth the price and great for newbies - but if you need a little more oomph to your navigation, keep looking. I will say this though - I do like MIO overall - you gotta work a little to figure it out, but once you do, it's easy and quick!. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, accurate, acquires GPS signal fast and in my limited testing. Love the QWERTY layout (with option to change to ABC unlike Garmin), nice announcement of street names. 
Cons:. Very poor POI database.. 
Summary:. The Mio C230 said to have 1.5 million POIs compared to Harman Kardon's 12 million POIs(listed elsewhere, not on HKs website) using the same Euro sourced Atlas maps as Mio. I love the basic features, interface, ease of use, and price. I have a factory Honda Nav for comparison and the Mio C230 is good. I have little experience with it and it would be unfair to comment much on accuracy, recalculation, etc but it seems to be good. I have spent the last several hours searching POIs which is very important to me when I rent a car in Kansas City in April and for wifey driving her car when not in the Odyssey with NAV. In my central Ohio town near Columbus, it could not locate a single Wal Mart!!!!, no Targets, and many other long established businesses here simply dont show up. In the POI it lists a fairly new very obscure soup joint that I frequent located above an ice cream shop- go figure. The closest Kroger it found was in Wheeling, WV. It found the Wal Mart gas station (Murphy Oil USA) but the POI does not list that Wal Mart sharing the same parking lot. Searching the POI via all ways: shopping, services, etc and manually searching, it located all listed POIs by typing e.g Best Buy pops up under shopping or if you type in Best Buy it pops up as expected. Under all searches Wal mart, Target, and many many others are no shows. I really wanted to like this unit but the poor POI database reders it useless for me. It is going back tomorrow and will cost me the 15% restocking fee at BB. If POIs are not important to you I don't think you can get the same features with any of the competition for double the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good windshield mount, bright enough screen during daytime, auto power off, easy to remove when leaving vehicle, displays mph. 
Cons:. Software fatal error crashes &#38; reboots sometimes, some streets aren't accurate, route recalcuation too slow when driving and doesn't give the most logical route. Changes views when not wanted.. 
Summary:. Don't get me wrong, this GPS is a very capable unit. Like all GPS on the market, it has it's flaws. I will be very nit picky with this review so you know what to possibly expect when using it.. Sometimes, but not too often, it will display a "fatal error now rebooting" box for no apparent reason. The map sometimes lists streets that do not exist or are named incorrectly. This can be a pain especially if there's a road that has multiple names and you are trying to program a route to there.. At first, I bought this unit because it had text to speech, but after awhile it became more of an annoyance than help.. When you are stopped at a light, the displayed map will sometimes start to spin slowly then stop anywhere from 90 to 180 degrees plus from the original direction orientation. I asked a guy I worked with if his Prius built-in GPS did that and he said yes, so I suspect that many are victim to that. Then when you start driving, it can take up to a quarter of a mile for the directional arrow to correct itself to where it should be. Imagine a couple of blocks of seeing the arrow "sliding" sideways on the street and the map slowly rotating to the correct orientation and direction. This is very annoying when the upcoming turns you have to make are close to each other (the map is trying to right itself but it's too slow for neighborhood navigating the back streets when this happens).. The MOST annoying bug this GPS has is this: I prefer to use 3D view when going to the destination I entered into it so I can see upcoming turns and bends that would be normally outside the field of view for the 2D, top-down view. The unit will occasionally change the view from 3D to airplane (top-down, north up, 2D). To even look at that view and try to navigate it is very disorienting to one that isn't used to it! I have to touch the view icon again to get back to 3D. Sometimes that can happen multiple times during, say, a 4 mile trip.. In the POI database, I found it funny that one of the search categories was "drive thru liquor stores!" Guess that would be a useful feature for a DUI alcoholic that's in a blackout and doesn't know where they are or what city they're in.. I know that in entry level GPS, that the features are going to be limited, but I would like to see a feature like the ability to edit maps on the unit or while hooked up to a pc. Things like deleting a street that doesn't exist or add one. Edit street names or add multiple names for a street.. Like I said in the beginning, I'm not saying that this GPS doesn't do it's job. It does. It just has a few annoyances that none of the reviews said anything about. Who knows, maybe I got a lemon?. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear display, easy-to-navigate menus. 
Cons:. Inaccurate distances, slow response. 
Summary:. Very inaccurate distances. Would say I was as much as 300 yards away from an intersection when I was actually at the intersection. It wouldn't notice that I had failed to turn until a block or 2 later. If I changed the route (as I often did since it would suggest some really bizarre routes) it would recalculate and try to send me through convoluted paths to return to its original route. Basically, I found it useless.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's small and probably won't break easily.. 
Cons:. It's completely unreliable. Twice in the last week it's taken me to a different address than the one I input. If it does take you to the right place, it will definitely take you on the longest route possible. Don't buy it.. 
Summary:. This thing is a piece of garbage. I've considered throwing mine out the window twice because it's caused me so much frustration. I'm not saying that it can't get you on the right track if you're lost, but it usually takes the longest route to get you where you need to go, it doesn't give you ample notice before you need to turn, and it's pretty hard to get the map looking the way you want it to. This thing really is not worth it. I decided to write this review after, for the second time, I input the address, got stuck in traffic for forty five minutes, only to realize that the thing was not taking me to the address I input. Obviously, it could have been my pressing the wrong button (or area of the screen, rather, since it's touch-screen), but I would say that's unlikely because I'm a relatively tech-savvy guy. This thing is simply and plainly user-unfriendly.If this is all you can afford, I'd say save some more money and in the meantime print directions from Google maps, which are usually very good.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice display, and configurable. 
Cons:. terrible trip calculations. 
Summary:. With gas @$4, the Mio C230's poor trip calculations, through grave yards, school playgrounds, nuclear power plants, meandering through residential neighbourhood's, etc., will result in many wasted miles and gas. I see about a 10 to 15% penalty in wasted, worthless millage using this pitiful device. The engineering resources went to eye candy, not the basic, expected function. It sux.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate Current location and traveling speed.. 
Cons:. Slow reponse, outdated maps, poor route selections.. 
Summary:. I have been looking for a good low priced GPS for months now. Reviews I read of the Mio C230 looked good. And after finding it at Best Buy for $149.00. I was hopeful that this unit would be the answer.. The first issue is that if you set the route parameter to short it kept wanting to route me via back streets even when there was no need to do it, and there was no way I could find to get it to use the best route with a combination of Highways and back roads. The reverse is true of the economical setting; it will not select any back roads, although if traveling by Interstate Highway the Fast setting does work pretty well. The other issue is the maps are so far out of date that you half to be careful of where it is telling you to go. Twice it has told me to turn the wrong way onto a one way road. Also, while traveling on a highway I came upon a newer section of road and it started navigating me to turn off of the highway and then route me back onto it later when it got to where the highway was in the map again. The POI features are almost a joke, although once while traveling on an Interstate Highway it actually found a restaurant and gas station close by. Another issue is how slow the system responds while driving. It will make you think it has frozen up, but if you will wait 5 or 6 seconds it will finally respond. The next major issue is trying to create a route ahead of time and saving it to use later, this feature is useless and will drive you mad. I have also had some issues with it telling me to turn at the next road while I was actually passing the road it was telling me to turn on. Although this is usually only a problem when you have several turns close together.. The windshield mounting system is simple to install and remove, very rugged, and very well designed so that the GPS unclips easily when you want to store it in the glove compartment.. The bottom line though is that it will get you to your destination, although it will most likely not chose the preferred route, if you knew where you were going to begin with. I have found the unit to be very accurate in terms of current location, distance and speed. The user manual is no help in showing you how to use the advanced features of the device and the website is totally useless. Tech support did respond within 48 hours with a reply to my E-mail but said that they do not control the updating of the Maps. They referred me to www.teleatlas.com for map issues. After going to there website they do not have an updated map and have no schedule when an update will be released.. Over all, unless you drive only interstate and major highways, or live in a large city setting I would not recommend this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Street Level Directions. 
Cons:. Is perpetually off by 100 Yards or More!. 
Summary:. I bought this for a trip to California - Am returning it tomorrow - It is a good looking item, and seems to be well built. The problem is I couldn't get an accurate GPS lock with it - It's always off by 100 yards or more - Which is a problem, especially in city driving. I like my gadgets to work - this just didn't for me - With GPS, as far as I am concerned, either it gets you there, or it doesn't - That's why the poor rating - I wanted to give it a 1, but it did get me within the general vicinity of where I was headed - I guess that's worth something?. 

$$;
Pros:. Lowest price unit with text to speech capability. 
Cons:. Crash prone and buggy OS with non-intuitive user interface. 
Summary:. Mio C230 is a disappointment. The operating system is buggy: one a 300 mile trip, the unit crashed and rebooted manually and now has lost some user-defined settings, such as my work address.. During the same trip, the "follow" icon mysteriously disappeared. Consequently, after physically moving the map (manually zooming &#38; paning), there was no way quick way to make the unit show the driver's current location. It was rather frustrating to drive in a new city with a frozen screen.. Another minor annoyance is that the unit shows altitude in miles + feet. This is probably not an issue for a wide majority of users but I happen to commute in the Rocky Mountains. It is rather odd to see altitude readings in non-standard units, such as 1 mile and 3000 ft (vs 8280 ft).. Finally, the user interface is not very intuitive, POIs are limited and route calculations are odd requiring a road atlas to confirm routing.. I am returning my mio c230 and will opt for a Garmin or TomTom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice to Speech. 
Cons:. Maps not as current as C720T. 
Summary:. I was in Best Buy about to buy this GPS unit but, since I live in a new subdivision, I searched for my own address to see how current the map info is. My address is not in this unit's map database. I put it down and picked up the more expensive Mio C720T expecting the same result. After all, they are made by the same company. To my surpise, my subdivision IS in the C720T. When I asked about this I was told that you have to buy the more expensive model to get the most current map data. I thought this couldn't possibly be right so I came home and called Mio support, and sure enough, you DO have to buy the more expensive model to get the most recent map data. I knew there would be differences in the POIs and that the unit would lack other features such as Bluetooth, etc., but I never dreamed they would skimp on the actual map data. I was under the impression that all units made by the same manufacturer would have the same map data across the board. Unfortunately that's not the case with Mio.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good display, TTS, excellent mounting system. 
Cons:. Very diffucult to edit a route, Route Simulation is so slow that it would take hours to simulate a 500 mile trip. 
Summary:. I have been looking for a good medium priced GPS for months now. I bought a Garmin Nuvi c350 and a Tom Tom One and sent both back because I could not live with their odd, quirky navigational systems. The Garmin kept wanting to route me via back streets when there was no need to do it, and there was no way I could find to get it to stop. The Tom Tom would allow me to avoid a particular route, but then would not allow me to save the route that I had so painstakingly put together, so that I could use it again in the future. Reviews I read of the Mio C230 were enthusiastic. So I was hopeful that this unit would be the answer.. Unfortunately it was not. I have been using GPS's for 15 years or so. I found the interface between laptop and GPS was so bad years back that I just stopped using a GPS. Now things are much better, but there are lots and lots of problems remaining.. The main problems are whether or not the maps are up to date, and whether or not they are accurate. The next problem is how well does the GPS software use the map information, coupled with user input, to provide a satisfactory route.. With this unit, when I started out setting it up, it did not clearly tell me where I was. I want a GPS to start out by saying where I am. You are at 1200 East Kingshighway, Atlanta, Ga. Is this correct? Etc. And then I want it to ask me for the destination I want. And once I have entered it, to tell me : "You have entered 1450 Distrolio Court as your destination. Is this correct? " And after I have clicked OK, I want it to calculate the route and then show me that route. both in text and visually. And then, when I see that they have routed me over an old bridge that was torn down 2 years ago, I want to be able to edit that route in order to avoid the bridge.. This is almost impossible with this machine because the text description of the route is totally inadequate -- you can't tell which part of the route you are editing, and the things you can edit -- "maneuver" and I think "route" are meaningless to me, and are not described in the quick start booklet or the longer .PDF user's manual file. And when I clicked on these categories to change the route, nothing happened. I could not tell what this machine had done in response to my request.. I can understand that each GPS has its quirks, that each will create a route using criteria derived from user input and from its factory software settings, but being able to alter the route is, to me at least, the single most important quality of a GPS. Of course it will make mistakes. Of course some its maps will be out of date, or simply wrong. But it absolutely has to allow the user to change the route and make it easy to do so.. This unit fails miserably in these regards.. These GPS companies IMHO need teams of frequent travelers to serve as their beta testers. Any grade school beta tester would have told this company what to do in about 5 minutes.. To end on a positive note: The windshield mounting system is the best I have ever seen for a GPS. It is simple to install and remove, very rugged, and very well designed so that the GPS unclips easily when you want to store it in the glove compartment.. One further problem is that, apparently because of recent map updates, the amount of space available for POI's went drastically down. I am not up to date on this, but although this unit accepts an SD card, and some other kind of card as well, it was not clear to me how to use it.. 

$$;
Pros:. It does have a nice display; voice volume is ample. 
Cons:. Software seemed to have no logic - counterintuitive. Difficult to navigate the software. Voice commands and display were at least 250 yards behind actual position. Downloaded the manual - worthless. I took it back to the store.. 
Summary:. Even the most tech savy individuals are going to have a hard time with this one!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, text-to-voice capability. 
Cons:. Terrible customer service, poor engineering, outdated maps. 
Summary:. I purchased the Mio C230 to replace an old Magellan system that I had. The reason that I replaced the Magellan was because Magellan had stopped supporting my model with new map updates. I chose the Mio C230 because it was the least expensive model that would speak street names (rather than simply, "take the next right," for example). What a disappointment this has been!. First, there is a software glitch in the C230 that doesn't allow you to enter an exact address for a destination. The "fix" according to Mio customer service is to add an address that is "close by" and the C230 will bump up or down the address so that, if you play with it enough, you can eventually get the system to find your desired destination. For example, if I'm looking for 224 Main Street and I enter that address, directions to 222 Main Street will come up. So if I really want 224 Main Street, I have to try 226 or 225 or 223 Main Street, and if I'm lucky, I'll get the right destination.. Second, the map for my C230 was out of date right out of the box. I wrote Mio and was told that it was the most current map that they had, and there were no plans to update it. This device has been around for a couple of years now, and still no map updates!. Third, if you go to the Mio web site and try to find downloads for the C230, this model is not to be found in most of the Mio pulldown menus. According to most of their support pages, the C230 doesn't even exist!. Fourth, the image and information about your vehicle on the display is off from real time by about a second or so. So if it tells you to turn right in 500 feet, you probably should have turned right because you've already missed your turn.. Fifth, I mapped out a return route from Raleigh to Winston-Salem recently. I requested the shortest route. What the C230 gave me would have taken me over ONE HOUR out of my way! What I eventually did was to pull out the free paper map from AAA and find my own route.. Finally, I was in Radio Shak today and noticed that they were selling map and driver updates for the C230 for over $70!!! Had I known that the only way to get current maps and fixes for the many glitches in this thing was to shell out another $70 bucks, I would never have bought it in the first place.. What a waste of time and money this thing has been!!! It's too late for me, but not for you! DO NOT PURCHASE A MIO PRODUCT!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, easy to use. 
Cons:. takes to long to locate signal, maps are outdated, directions are not always the best, will reset itself too often.. 
Summary:. For an entry level GPS device I would say that it is Ok at best. I use mine frequently while on business. I still have to print paper directions because my GPS takes a very long time to locate me, and then will lose signal too frequently. The POI search is a joke. It will find restaraunts that are 300 mi, away, but not the coffee shop that I am in front of. I would not recommend this product to anyone, spend the little extra money now and get a Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can't think of any.. 
Cons:. Often loses GPS signal and freezes, and can't find where you are. Often doens't recognize rural roads.. 
Summary:. This device constantly loses the GPS signal, freezes, and then will not recognize where you area. On numerous occasions it has not recognized roads in rural areas, or has directed us to roads that don't exist. The directions that it does give often are not the best route.. 

$$;
Pros:. cheap, small, text to voice. 
Cons:. bad maps, bad POI database, poor tracking. 
Summary:. it was my first navigation system, attracted me with a price tag and text to voice capability and small size. main issues that forced me to return the system:. - poor maps, driving in San Francisco it would take me to one-way streets, dead-end streets, places with no streets. -POI is absolutely laughable: driving in lake tahoe area,no ski resorts. no home depot, or albertsons, or REI, and many many others. i don't think i used POI database once. - horrible real time tracking: if you take a wrong turn, you are SOL, the route is gone and you have to go and manually enter the address again. imaging doing it while driving in congested city over and over and over. -slow gps signal: if gps signal is lost, need to wait at least 5 minutes. -difficult to use touchscreen: the buttons are too close to each other. -no support from the co: i e-mailed support and nevr heard back!. this one is going back to Circuit City and they better take it back!. -. 

$$;
Pros:. compact, inexpensive, text to speech. 
Cons:. limited pois, limited memory, limited maps, limited web support. 
Summary:. At first, this unit was an awesome deal...or so i thought. I opened the box, mounted the unit, turned it on....voila...no basemap of my area. I then looked for updates on the mio-tech website...no such luck. Oh, and tele-atlas is notorious for not updating their us maps. I told myself...ok no biggie. So i try to add POI's, first off, the software to load pois, had to be located at the mio-tech, belgium site. (thank god for google!) I follow the directions to the T, load my poi's (poifriend.com)...restart the unit....and voila...poi searching becomes unbearably slow. Typing slows to a crawl, searching slows to a crawl....rediculous... If text to speech wasn't so important to me, i wouldn't have gotten this unit....once again.. you get what you pay for. returning mine and going with a magellan or garmin.. ARRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. None! User interface is "clunky". 
Cons:. No map updates available at Mio.com. It worked a few times when I first got the C230, but now very unreliable. It would reset itself in the middle a trip and would adjust itself to old trips!!. 
Summary:. Don't waste your money! Go TomTom, or Garmin! Spend a few extra bucks and you'll be happy you did!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap with a pretty display screen...that's it!. 
Cons:. Purchased as Christmas and it has never calculated one trip correctly. There are no instructions or support systems. Each trip it was used, ended in extra miles, gas and dollars.. 
Summary:. DO NOT PURCHASE WITHOUT FIRST DOING YOUR RESEARCH!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is selling for a good price. 
Cons:. Very slow and does not recognize medians. Voice could be more audible. 
Summary:. The battery lasts for 45 to 50 minutes while navigating. I have only had this device for 3 1/2 months and Customer Service refused to address this problem saying that they advise customers to keep it plugged in, however they have on their website that the battery lasts up to 4 1/2 hours. People get a Tom Tom instead!!!. The Points of Interests are also limited.This thing cant even find a Wal Mart.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing good to say. 
Cons:. GPS crashed after 1 week of use. 
Summary:. Very poor. After using for only one week the screen went blank and unit does not work. I will attempt to get my money back but retailer says I have to go to the manufacturer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cannot think of even one.. 
Cons:. Bad Software and they knew it. 
Summary:. This company is a total fraud. They knew that their software was bad, but left it on the shelves anyway. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE. If you want to register the product (only wanted to register for our state Consumer Fraud Division complaint)you have to "become a club member". No way. You can't even email them unless you "join their club". Scammers..
