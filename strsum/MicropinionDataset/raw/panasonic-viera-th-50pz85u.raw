Cons:. No sound control from TV when using an external sound system. 
Summary:. The picture is sharp. About a month after set-up a white vertical bar suddenly appeared. Called service and set was picked up the next morning, repaired and rehung on the wall in two days and I live in a rural area, 50 miles from the repair center. Fast and very professional!.

$$;
Pros:. This T.v. for the money is the best plasma on market. 
Cons:. I have no cons for this television!!!. 
Summary:. I did alot of research when I knew I was going to get a new T.V. This is what I decided on next to the pioneer best plasma for the money. Great blacks vibrant colors very attractive on my wall. highly recomend if you are considering a plasma this is the one for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is superb! Ease of use remote. Doesnt heat your room up. Everyone says WOW!..What a picture.. 
Cons:. Price could be lower but for quality its worth it. 
Summary:. Purchased my new Panasonic plasma. Just wonderful picture, really, its that good. If you have HD cable or sat. You will luv this unit. I looked at the new LCD's but still plasma is the way to go if you dont want the herky jerky of fast motion. Stays cool, easy to operate. I see why this one is getting all the good reviews. Panasonic did their job on this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, Looks Nice, Price. 
Cons:. None big enough worth mentioning.. 
Summary:. Finally it's my turn to add my two cents in about this TV. I'm not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said so I'll basically echo all the kudos that others have given this set. First off the set is sleek and good looking even when off. A lot of people have mentioned the glare issue. If you place this set in a room with a lot of direct sunlight or surround it with lamps and ambient light I could see how it could be a factor but in a room with that much light any set would have a problem.. Now on to performance. The picture is clear, crisp, vibrant and all the other brochure type adjectives included. The most impressive thing about this set is its black levels, they are AMAZING. Whether in the daytime or night nighttime scenes in movies look great. Colors are very vibrant. Watching the Planet Earth series Blu Ray on my PS3 I sat in amazement. I won't even mention how ridiculously good Ratatouille looked on Blu Ray. This set was an upgrade from my 42" Panasonic EDTV and I couldn't be happier. Regular cable looks good, DVD's look great and of course the ultimate is Blu Ray movies. Sound is above average when watching regular TV but of course the home theater comes on when it's movie or game time. Playing games on this set is awesome and not a hint of any burn in or motion blur.. Panasonic has outdone themselves with this line. This is definitely top tier quality for second or even third tier price. The only competition this set honestly has is a Pioneer. But even Cnet.com stated that the difference in black levels between this line and a Pioneer had to be measured with equipment to be noticed. To me that's not worth an extra grand or more. So if you're on the fence about this set don't think about it anymore. Click "Buy" or head to your local retailer, get it home then invite all your friends over and try not to rip your shirt while you poke your chest out.. P.S. You do not need $100 Monster Cables. I have 3 HDMI cables total and the most expensive one was about $20. I get a full 1080p signal and full PCM recognition from my PS3.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning Picture, Great Price, amazing TV!!. 
Cons:. Lacks some picture settings, draws a little more power than most TVs this size. 
Summary:. I spent about 4 months solid looking at every single TV out there. I am very critical when it comes to my electronics, so I took my time and did my research. First was between LCD or Plasma -- by far PLASMA!! Better motion, better picture, and better reproduction of non HD signals. Once you follow the instructions for the first 100 hr break in period there is no worry about burn in or anything and it looks amazing. The only TV that looks as good is the kuro but I truly feel this is fully comparable and way less expensive. This TV is amazing!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, less glare than the samsung models, very easy menu system. 
Cons:. Remote does not light up for night time use, too much yellow and red but can easy tone down with picture settings. 
Summary:. Did a lot of research and read even more reviews on every tv in this price range, Came down between this and the Samsung PN50A550. The Samsung seemed to have a little bit better picture, but messed with the custom picture setting on the panasonic and can make it look the same. The Tie breaker was the samsung just had way too much glare, set next to each other the samsung reflects about 10 times the light that the panasonic does.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Black Levels. 
Cons:. Sometimes to hard to see screen when the light hits the TV and your standing at an angle. 
Summary:. Just the best damn TV I've ever had. You will not be sorry if you get this.. 

$$;
Pros:. GREAT PICTURE RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX WITH FEW ADJUSTMENTS. 
Cons:. INSTRUCTIONS POOR. 

$$;
Pros:. accurate colour and easy to use menu.. 
Cons:. no swivel base.. 
Summary:. As previously stated, I am a picky imaging professional, and am very hard to please when it comes to televisions. This unit is truly fantastic. I watched my first full NHL playoff game in HD...amazing. I'm not sure where previous reviewers bought the units, but the one I bought, was setup and checked in my home by the store technicians, and they ensure it was working to my satisfaction. I am puzzled as to where the other reviewer saw glare? Mine has very effective anti-glare glass. I suppose if you are putting it in a very bright room or direct sunlight? My living room is not blacked out, and is brighter than most during the day, and i have no problems with image quality.. I have had "professional" salesmen tell me that Plasma is on its way out (despite the fact that demand is almost outstripping supply) "plasmas give off too much heat" (mine gives almost none, and much less than my three year old CRT), and of course the old "the life expectancy of plasma sets is very short".. I am very glad the staff at the store I bought my unit are not on commission, and under pressure to move LCD stock.. If I do find any annoyances I will let you know.. For the posters who have ghosting and bad reflective issues, I would check the back of the unit and make sure they did not give you last years model....just sounds odd.. 

$$;
Pros:. PQ, Blacks, refresh rate. 
Cons:. green a little bright. 
Summary:. This is my first plasma but compared to my previous Hitachi rear projection and the LCDs that I have watched, this TV is great. The colors are bright and vibrant. The blacks are crisp. I am really enjoying this TV. The colors really seem to come into their own as you watch the TV. After the 100 hour break in period that plasmas need, I saw an ever better picture.. 

$$;
Pros:. Was easy to assemble right out the box. Great sound quality. Picture looks as real as real can get. Great colors and clarity. Have had TV for one year with out additional waranty and know regrets!!!. 
Cons:. wish the owners manual give you info on how to make the best setting for the high def. 
Summary:. plasma rules over lcd. I have both that's how I know!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Contrast ratio, black levels, AR screen, sound, ease of use. 
Cons:. Greens are yellow-ish, no pic-in-pic. 
Summary:. I checked out several TVs over a several week period and had it narrowed down to this set a a Samsung PN50A550. The Pioneers for sure had the best pics, but I didn't want to move to that price range. Even though the Samsung had slightly better color, I settled on the TH50-PZ85U due to it's superior anti-reflective screen and better sound quality. I don't intend to install a sound system so that was an issue. I am just past the 100 hour break in period. I had to adjust the picture settings a good bit to tone down the color intensity, as well reducing the yellow in the greens. My current settings for watching HD programming are : picture 64, brightness 60, color 45, tint -4, sharpness 20, color temp warm, color management on, black level dark. There are a few others, but these settings have the most impact and with the current settings the picture is excellent and very realistic. For HD size, "2" is 100% with no overscan, but I had frequent interference(for lack of a better term)around the edges. I opted for size "1" which crops off 5% around the edges, but I really don't notice anything missing. For gaming, the factory "game" setting seems to be perfect. I haven't noticed any display problems of any kind during fast action gameplay. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture and size of the money. 
Cons:. Some small quality issues. 
Summary:. I've own my TH-50PZ05U for about 2 weeks as I am writing this.. I got it from a local store and I am glad I did (rather than buying online) because I had to return the first unit because it was buzzing very loudly to my taste. The second unit was a lot quieter but there is still a noticeable buzz when the room is really quiet and picture very bright. But it's acceptable. I am very picky. My wife doesn't even hear it. Also this 50in unit has cooling fans which no matter what will produce some noise.. The other small issue is that the upper left corner had what I believed was a dead pixel but is in fact a small piece of dust stuck between the glass and the screen. It's only visible from less than 3 feet away so that's absolutely not an issue. But this and the first unit loud buzzing are signs that Panasonic has quality control issues. I didn't buy the extended waranty at the store but now I might consider it.. However I do think this plasma TV is a GREAT deal for the money (paid $1900 for it). The picture contrast and colors are fantastic. I've been watching several Bluray movies, HD TV program and played GT5 on my PS3 and the performance in all cases was great. I found that the best picture setting were "movie" and "standard". Other settings ("game" and "vivid") give an artificial look to the images (saturated colors). I didn't bother calibrating because I'm really satisfied with the "movie" setting.. The connectivity is good. Total of 8 different inputs (3 HDMI) and switching input is very easy. The menu system is sober (no fancy visual effects) yet easy to use: so far I didn't have to open the user guide. The SD card reader and PC input are nice to have but if you intend to mainly use this TV with a computer or for watching photos an LCD is probably a better choice.. Finally, I was a bit worried about plasma being power hungry (the spec says 700Watts) but because plasma only use their peak power when picture is totally white I found that this unit barely uses more electricty than my former Sony 27in CRT TV. LCDs use their nominal power all the time so in real usage the difference with a plasma probably not huge.. So would I recommend this TV? I am still over the fence. I am a very picky person. If you like the looks and picture of this TV, go for it: it's a great deal. All manufactures have quality issues and that's what warranties are for. But if you want total perfection and can afford it go for the high end 800 series. I do think that Panasonic may have cut some corners to come up with a 1080 50in plasma for this price.. 

$$;
Pros:. High contrast, easy to use, nice looking and low glare.. 
Cons:. IR problems, "green ghosting or phoshpor lag" ,remote. 
Summary:. Well, I received this plasma (my first plasma) this week and was horrified to find out about this phenomenon known as phosphor lag or green ghosting. Seems to be common among most plasmas. I got rid om my 52" Sony LCD (W3000) because the motion blur was horrible. Now, I have green flashes when I game on the tv, and have noticed it just a little upon watching Blu Ray. The remote also was a disappointment, with some seemingly commonly used buttons dismissed for newer features that frankly, many will not use (like Viera link). People say the ghosting will reduce over time, I hope they are right but I may not have the unit long enough to find out. Otherwise, I am still in the "break-in period" and have had the unit on for several hours today and it did not seem loud or generate much heat. Also, the inputs were easily accessible and there was a nifty wire management system i have never seen. Being as this is the 2nd TV (the first had an uneven panel issue) I have not taken it off of standard setting. I put the first through the ringer, and I will say the picture looked great and rivaled that of the Sony (still, anyway). After the "break in period" I will know more, and possibly have good news about the ghosting (fingers crossed).. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture. 
Cons:. don't like that this expense of a tv would die after only 14 months and minimal use... SAD. 
Summary:. Due to the failure of the TV, cannot recommend it. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality,connectivity, style and good value...but... 
Cons:. Power went out , never turned on,led blinked twice- code for defective SC 15v board, panasonic service the worst I have ever experienced.The value is evidently a function of poor quality parts. Went back to Sony. 
Summary:. Panasonic is not delivering on reliability. 

$$;
Pros:. picture, size. 
Cons:. the fact that it is dead after 1.5 years. 
Summary:. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU GET EXTENDED WARRENTY, not worth the hassel of repair, product should have lasted at the least 8 years, looking into starting a class action, selling product with known defect. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality is good offers numerous HDMI ports, USB connection, SD slots, sound is okay.. 
Cons:. Had the set for 14 months and TV dies on me and power light blinks 10 times. Called Panasonic and they won't help because its past the 12 mos mfg warranty. Called extended warranty svc provider and they ordered a part that can take 6 weeks!!!!. 
Summary:. I purchased this tv set brand new because of the many available features and great picture quality. It went a year without a hitch but at the 14 mo. mark, it started turning off on its own and then would have to be off for several hours before it could be turned on again. Then it went dead and wouldnt come back on but power light blinked 10 times. Called Panasonic and they seemed to know about the problem related to a power supply part in unit. They were no help because it was past the manufacturer warranty. I called the extended warranty svc provider and they came out and couldn't figure it out at first. Once they found out the exact part that had to be ordered they learned it would take up to 6 weeks or more to get because its back ordered......probably because many other units are having the same flaw! Now I'm just waiting for the dang part but will never buy Panasonic TV again. Cheap parts in a not so cheap TV set! Should've gone with Sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a great picture, but what good is it if you can't turn it on.. 
Cons:. It will not turn on and panasonic has known about this problem for years, it should have been fixed and they should be recalled.. 
Summary:. Quality of this product is bad, and they keep selling the faulty product. I can not afford a new tv all the time. I am very disappointed with this tv. Pansaonic will not do anything about this!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture. Bright, deep blacks, great connectivity. Works fantastically with TV/Cable/PS3/DVDs/etc. Never noticed burn in. 
Cons:. Panasonic quality control = fail. Panasonic customer service = fail. Quality picture + great price - not fixing a known issue = fail. 
Summary:. I purchased this TV in November of 2008. In December of 2009 (yep, 1 month after warranty expired) I got the blinking red lights of death. Doesn't turn on at all.. Called Panasonic, "Sorry, nothing we can do outside the warranty period. Here is the number of a repair shop." I got in contact with a manager, and after stringing me along for TWO MONTHS, they finally told me tough luck, nothing they can do. This issue is all over the internet (google it) and after talking to a repair shop it would be over $600 to get 3 circuit boards and the power supply replaced.. My only hope is that the TV now works great to tempt thieves to break-into my house and waste their time stealing junk. I hope someone breaks in and steals it because at least my homeowners insurance wouldn't stick it to me like Panasonic has. This issue is not limited to this model nor only to their plasma screens?stay away from Panasonic TV?s!. 

$$;
Pros:. nice picture. 
Cons:. reflects like a mirror (even the bezels reflect!!). 
Summary:. Ok, so as a another reviewer has mentioned, the reflections are really bad from both the screen as well as the glossy bezel. So bad that it almost makes the tv unwatchable in anything but pitch black room. The picture on the other hand is great, but I doubt it is *that* much better than last years model or any other tv hundreds of dollars less to compensate for the awful glare/reflection. Save yourself some grief, don't buy this years model.. I cant believe how Panasonic could have botched this so badly.... 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture.. 
Cons:. Broke after 20 months.. 
Summary:. Bad power suply, boards. My TV is DEAD after 20 months of use. Cost $500.00. Power LED is blinking 10 times. Consider to buy another brand!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the tv, easy to navigate controls. It has a bright beautiful picture and have been up till now very happy with this tv. 
Cons:. Known flaws with circuits and poor assembly. You will run into problems with set not turning on. Its only a matter of time. 
Summary:. Like I said above DO NOT GET THIS TV WITHOUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. Trust me you'll be very happy you did. There is no way a TV that cost this much should last less than two years. I had been very happy with this TV up until the point of it not turning on. One minute its working fine and then the next you cant even turn the TV on. I was fortunate enough to have purchased the extended warranty and have someone coming this week to fix it. I'm very disappointed in Panasonic, I had called them first and they act like they don't know about the problem and leave you out in the cold and all they do for you is give you the name of a local TV repair place. The place Panasonic sent me to was charging 100 dollars just to come out and look at it. I will never buy another Panasonic television and will be paying a little extra and going with only Sony from now on..
