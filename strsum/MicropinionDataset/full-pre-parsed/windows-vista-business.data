i have been following microsoft technologies both as a developer and an evangelist for years now and personally speaking i have never seen them invest this much of research , time and efforts into an offering  .

they may have had their bad days and a plethora of goof ups , but in vista they have carved their stronghold  .

windows vista business is the perfect blend of performance , features and looks with the immaculate software and hardware compatibility backup known to bring smiles to millions of windows operating system fans all across the globe  .

i have a read a lot of terrible reviews about this product and i do not see why people have such a problem with  .

either they are too dumb to figure out a few simple things (for crying out loud microsoft is a company that redefined ui friendliness and ease of use and partnerships with software and hardware vendors so that things actually work  .

try making your grandma use linux) or are plain cry babies i have been a power user of windows for years , a beta tester and a  .

net develeoper for web , desktop and enterprise applications for over 4 years now and i absolutely adore this operating system , i really feel pampered  .

thanks ms  .

i use vista business at my school with roaming profiles and it is really great  .

i have only had one problem with this and it is the it person's falut .

vista business is far less trouble prone then xp business  .

this os is very solid with few errors and bugs  .

microsoft has done a fine job with this os despite a few start up problems  .

i think the net has some catching up to do before it's full capabilities are reached  .

this is especially true for web 2 programs , applications and utilities involving video , gaming and perhaps audio  .

i believe there are still problems with connectivity , ie7 , and usb support concerning ready boost  .

more could be done to improve pc over heating problems and video connectivity  .

let's hope we see these improvements in sp2  .

much work should be done with problem reports and solutions  .

to many problems are going unresolved  .

i certainly hope they resolve the event 1003 , dhcp client error that has been present in me , xp business and now in vista business  .

this error consumes hardware resources and needs to go away  .

fine job microsoft , time to press forward for a perfect 10 .

i have heard so many people complaining about windows vista being trash and a disaster  .

this is very discouraging for me or anyone attempting to try this new os  .

when buying my vaio sz780 notebook , the sales clerk predicted that i would soon run into trouble with lousy vista like he did  .

he in fact advised me to remove it an put xp in for replacement  .

you know what  .

they are all way wrong  .

the business edition on my notebook has been working like a charm despite my intensive use  .

it gives me all i want from look and feel to performance  .

the aero glass display is stunning on my vaio and search now is just a breeze much as navigating through the system  .

wireless networking is extremely stable unlike xp  .

these are just a few and i cannot name it all what i love  .

microsoft obviously did a very good job putting together this awesome os and i see no reason for going back to xp having said that , i have to admit that vista does have some nagging bugs  .

i personally have experienced issues with slow network printing through xp    based computers and sluggish hibernation  .

however i have managed to fix the network printing issue using some easy tweaks  .

hibernation is still faulty but i can live with it  .

some experts say this is a particular problem with computers having 4gb of ram which is my case after all there is so much to the bright side of vista which totally outweighs its minor negatives  .

i believe with service pack 2 , vista will be perfect and get a 10 from me  .

for now i give it 9 and keep on enjoying it .

i built this comp  .

in dec  .

of 2006 , not really having vista on my mind  .

is running xp pro sp/2 1  .

81ghz sempron , 1gb memory , ati radeon 550 card nothing great , not a real kick your a  .

comp  .

but fairly good  .

had an upgrade redemption form for vista buisness and sent it in , recieved it a week ago , is not going to install after all the horror stories i have read about vista  .

but since the worst that could happen would have to reformat and go back to xp , if vista did not work on my comp  .

while running xp , hp software hated me as well as kodak nothing but problems  .

tried all up dates patches and what knots , just hated xp  .

pretty cool building a comp  .

and cant use your programs lol since the upgrade , wow what a difference , all works great but ati software and nero 6 mem at 1gb runs about 43% 585 to 600 mb free areo is to cool the whole os of vista very smooth and very impressive to me  .

i guess i am lucky with only two problems that can be repaired easly  .

just goes to show , dont believe what all talk about and dont like  .

sure vista is not comp  .

with old computers but they are history anymore  .

i would reccomend vista to all that have a fairly new computer neil  .

to start off i would like to say that i in way claim the illusion of objectivity in my review ; i have always loved the speed and customizeability of microsoft products and have been a microsoft customer for 8+ years    i've had the pleasure of using vista beta for 1 month and vista business for 5 days    my current computer's specifications  .

inspiron 6400/e1505 , 120 gb 5600 rpm hd , 1 gb 666mhz ram , ati x1300 128 mb video card  .

first off i'd like to say that if you are interested in buying a new operating system , do your research first  .

if your hardware vendors have not made vista drivers yet for you then do not buy vista yet  .

if you really want it quickly i suggest e    mailing those vendors and pressuring them to get with the program (pun intended)  .

now , on to the review ~installation of vista on my machine    .

installing vista is child's work even when installing on a seperate partition along with xp (partitioning the hd however , is not child's work)  .

installation took about 32 minutes from when i put the cd in to when i is fully logged in to vista i is soon greated with a simple welcome window and a windows update notification with a few drivers that i needed to download  .

i press a button , then another , and voila  .

all my hardware works  .

(may not be so easy for others without a vista premium capable dell)    the interface (look and feel)    .

these days all you hear about operating systems is how nice they 'feel' and how great they look  .

if you're looking to show vista off to others you are in luck  .

it is a stunner  .

no where near the shear power of beryl on ubuntu but still quite spectacular  .

moreover , this interface does not bogg the user down but feels crisp and well bouncy ~features    .

basically , as an extremely proficient xp user (who said i is arrogant  .

) , my windows xp already had most of the features in vista installed through third party vendors and tweaks  .

however , for those of you without my amazing powers vista is a godsend  .

let me outline some things for you    .

search    extremely fast and accessible searchs allow you to run programs or documents simply by hitting the windows key and typing the first 4 letters (maybe 3 , maybe even 2) of the program or document's name  .

productivity goes through the roof  .

contextual searching also makes searching through folders easy with a simple shortcut (windows key + s) when in a folder view in explorer 2  .

navigation    .

moving around in vista is a breeze with the new 3d tab view (windows key + tab) and previews on the taskbar  .

everything i look for in a folder is exactly where i expect it to be and working with files has never been easier  .

however , there is a dark side to all of this (see security below) 3  .

desktop sidebar  .

although this is nothing new (konfabulator is the first) it's about time microsoft integrated mini programs ( gadgets ) into its operating system  .

i've found some (drool) really useful ones that replace the functionality of full programs i had in xp  .

and when it gets intrusive simply turn it off 4  .

many others like    .

built in 3d games  .

revamped volume controls  .

iii  .

new and fast windows media player  .

easy networking and filesharing  .

etc ~security    .

with the addition of user account control and the built in windows defender (for spyware) vista is almost bullet proof when run as a standard user  .

even running as an administrator is much more secure than it is under xp  .

no programs install themselves without the explicit authorization of the user and no system files (or any files for that matter) can be modified without permission however , due to the constant nagging of security it may get very frustrating for an expert user who installs a lot of programs  .

therefore i recommend switching uac (user account control) off when first installing all of your programs on vista  .

also , i would suggest getting a virus scanning program to supplement windows defender (avg free is great) all in all this will become a great investment when all the driver/software issues are sorted out (all of mine have been)  .

however , the price may still be prohibitive to many  .

i for one would never have bough a $300 operating system and only am using vista because i got it free though my college msdn free software licensing program  .

(jealous  .

well i pay $40k a year to go here )  .

my recommendation   vista is the upgrade in your life that you've been waiting for  .

but before you upgrade , research , resewarch , and research  .

and if you're one of the lucky ones without any problems , buy buy buy  .

(nsyc' reference anyone  .

~peace out  .

outstanding job by ms they really got this one right  .

i think the cnet editors should read their own review pretty awesome features  .

the image backup is the only real way to completely recover from a hard drive crash and vista does this perfectly  .

the search is great , you really do not need to know where for example the network configuration lives you just use the search function on the start menu and type network  .

i have been using vista business in beta for about 3 months and the final release for 1 month now and the longer i use it the better i like it  .

i am running it on a averatec laptop ($799) with full aero support (score 2  .

as for the mac os comment i have been supporting mac os professionally since the early 80's and vista is clearly better  .

apple has reduce themselves to writing gui's for unix and that is it  .

my 2 cents  .

say what you will about microsoft , but windows vista is all right  .

i replaced xp professional with vista business on my macbook (soon thereafter , i replaced os x tiger with leopard) , and i have to say , even though it's a microsoft product , i'm still impressed the most obvious change from xp is the new interface  .

aero , i think , is an improvement over even aqua on the mac ; the translucence of your window elements and task bar lend an airiness to the windows interface that no other os can match (unless you've customized your linux to resemble vista , of course)  .

i enjoy this , as it's a highlight to my day shuffling among word 2007 , visual studio 2005 , firefox , and my other favorite windows applications i is surprised to see my copy of word 97 working in vista without any issues ; likewise , i got age of empires 2 , a game released in 1999 , working without issue  .

some good  .

but what bugs me even today is that some old applications utterly refuse to work , and even vs 2005 has a litany of compatibility issues  .

but at least microsoft is working on backward compatibility , unlike another computer company out there non    admin users have to supply the name and password of an admin in order to complete the action the code base is also more secure as a virtue of being based on windows server 2003 rather than windows xp ; say what you will about the vista development cycle , but this is the single smartest decision microsoft made vista is not without its warts , though  .

as i alluded to above , visual studio 2005 is not perfectly compatible with vista , and there are (from around the internet , anyway) more reports of incompatibility  .

most people wo not get bit by those , though and let's face it       vista is a hoss of an operating system ; on my macbook , easily 40% of the machine's 2048 mb of ram is in use at any given time  .

now with that much memory and a dual    core processor , vista is sufferable , but i'd hate to be one of the people who got a machine with 512 mb of ram and a single    core cpu , hoping that vista would run on it  .

and with an official requirement of 15 gb of hard drive space , it's nigh impossible to dual boot vista with anything terribly recent , at least on the piddly 60 gb hard drive in my laptop       i recently took leopard off my macbook to make the machine windows    only  .

(thankfully , i have a power mac for leopard , and a powerbook for linux  .

) any new machine that you spend a reasonable amount for should have enough muscle to run vista , but those with older machines should be careful  .

microsoft happens to make a windows vista upgrade advisor for people hoping to run vista on their older pc       the advisor reports that my parents' old pentium 4    based compaq tower will run it just fine , thanks to the non    integrated video  .

but they're sticking with xp for now in sum , i encourage people who are looking for a new pc to just go ahead and jump in with vista       it's a pleasant romp , at least i think so , and mac users needing a copy to dual    boot with cannot really go wrong either  .

just make sure to buy as much ram as you can afford (but hey , that's a strategy for any os these days , right  .

) , and open your mind to the future of windows .

i upgraded the hp dv6000t laptop to windows vista business about a month ago  .

so far i have not any major issues  .

somethings to keep in mind    .

a) when installing vista , the user account you first create is an administrative account  .

it is advisable to not use administrative account for daily use  .

once you are done installing vista and all initial software , create a standard user account for yourself  .

use this account as your main account for using vista  .

i made the mistake of using the administrative to configure my e    mail and browser settings  .

after all , i is using administrative account in xp also  .

this proved to be a mistake  .

with the new uac , vista is modeled after unix/linux kind of os  .

the administrative account should be used only for software installs etc  .

whne i created the standard user account for myself , i had to migrate all my settings from one account to another b) make sure that you have vista drivers for all hardware  .

you will save a lot of trouble c) always do a fresh/clean install of vista d) i do not know why microsoft has done it but i find it very irritating  .

when i open explorer , i see a folder with my account name  .

under this folder , there are folders like documents (this is actually a replacement for my documents) , downloads , favorites etc  .

however , there are some folders which look like links or shortcuts  .

when i click on them , i get access denied error  .

if microsoft did not want me to access these folders , why show them  .

these are very confusing and their functionality is not clear d) the videos on cnet  .

com do not play under vista when using ie with protected mode on  .

however , if i keep moving the mouse cursor , the videos will keep playing  .

moment i stop moving the mouse cursor , the videos stop playing  .

i do not know why this is happening other than these minor observations , i am satisfied with vista performance  .

i get same battery life with vista as i used to get with xp  .

maybe i am just lucky but i never had any issues with vista  .

maybe it is because the hp laptop is designed with vista in mind .

i like the fact that the clunky xp pro gui has been replaced with a clean , edgy gui which makes vista a lot of fun to use  .

i had some minor installation which i is able to figure out pretty easily  .

all in all a pretty good product  .

in my opinion one of the better products by microsoft .

hey this operating is a great improvement over windows xp , yet it still has some bugs that need to get fixed , but as of right now  .

i am very happy with this product  .

and for those apple haters if apple is making their operating system available for all pc users  .

people would be having the same hardware problems microsoft is experiencing or even worse so please keep your stupid comments to yourself .

the main reason that i'm posting this review is to comment on cnet's abject hate of the search function being one level down  .

here's the thing , if you're about to type then your fingers are on the keyboard  .

all you have to do is tap the windows button to and the start menu pops up and anything you type goes into the search box  .

then push the enter key and presto       no need to click anything or delve through layers  .

this is a hundred times more convenient then having search on the desktop , which would require me to minimize all of my windows just to search one thing i don't like is windows sidebar  .

the gadgets cannot be resized , and are for the most part to small to be useful (looking at you , rss reader)  .

for whatever reason there is not a gadget to control media players , which is one of my favorites on google desktop (far superior to windows sidebar) i don't regret my free upgrade (courtesy of the university of florida , go gators  .

) , but i would not pay money for vista  .

most of the useful features are free through programs like google desktop and window blinds , so whats the point of spending hundreds of dollars  .

i recently put together a new computer running a dual core amd athlon 64 4200+ and a fairly decent nvidia graphics card  .

i decided to try and see how vista would run on this computer and i is surprised at how smoothly everything went  .

the upgrade from xp to vista went smoothly and finished in less than an hour  .

all my programs and files transferred over saving me the trouble of reinstalling everything  .

the aero graphics engine is a nice upgrade from the old xp style and is appealing to the eyes  .

the change to the explorer and path bar is much simpler and easier to use than xp  .

almost all of my programs worked with the exception of my ancient networking card which is easily replaced with a 10 dollar gigabit card  .

vista is definitely a step up from xp in terms of use and reliability , but some annoying features and monetary issues may keep people from upgrading windows vista comes in a variety of flavors from basic to ultimate edition  .

i would suggest going with the home premium edition to get the most out of your money  .

in the months before vista came out there is a stir that its steep hardware requirements were just too much for some too handle  .

while this may be true for those who have computers that should be upgraded anyways , most can do very well with just upgrading their ram to 1gb or better now to address the downfalls  .

since this is a new os and not many vendors have updated their drivers for vista , some may find that their old hardware may not work correctly or at all in vista  .

if you are worried about your stuff crapping out in vista then i suggest waiting a few months before upgrading to give some time for the vista drivers to show up  .

most xp drivers work with vista so there is not too much to worry about anyways  .

the only other annoyance i had with vista were the continual security pop    ups before any software is installed or changes made to system settings  .

though this is a good form of security and helps the user know exactly what they are about to do , most will find this an annoying feature that just adds another extra step to certain processes  .

there are ways to turn these alerts off but vista comes with them turned on other than those few things i find vista to be a very viable upgrade from xp and worth the money .

also a con , ie seems to behave weird with sites that worked fine in xp  .

there is a lot of flashing and glitching , even though the correct plugins are installed (i'm sure this will be fixed though)  .

on the upside , i haven't really had any driver problems or program problems , and in fact a few that were wrong in xp have been fixed (such as a problem i had with my mouse cursor jumping around for no reason)  .

bottom line , the upgrade is good , but i just cannot believe they did not put the games in vista business .

i really enjoy using this operating system  .

aero looks and feels great  .

the gadget toolbar is nice to mess around with  .

it does not have anything completely new or innovative ; but , i like that windows put things like sticky notes , and an rss reader in automatically the hardest things about vista is figuring out just where exactly controls lay  .

for instance , they changed up the control panel layout and getting use to how to change the appearance of the windows and desktop take a few minutes the only other major irritant is that sometimes aero shuts off when programs are not able to use it  .

if i go to a webpage with embedded java applets , aero shuts off  .

this is a problem that will be fixed with time .

laptop came with vista premium and never functioned very well ; very slow to boot , system freezes etc  .

after the change to business virtually all these issues disappeared  .

i had to do a clean install as vista has so many versions it is not compatible with itself  .

this most likely helped the performance as the clean install also god rid of the junk software all new machines are loaed down with at the factory  .

i am pleased with this version and for now will not make the move back to xp , which i is seriously considering  .

will ive windows 7 a look but for now this is much better than expected after the slow start .

windows vista is everything consumers asked for in a new windows , which is stability and security enhancements  .

however , in order to get those promises , microsoft killed performance badly  .

even on a macbook with the latest chipset and sp 1 , it still has issues with file copying and other things  .

other than that though , vista is still a good operating system for people that want familiarity with their computers .

it worked well from day one , it's stable and demanding applications perform well , sometimes , though not too often , better than in the older oses  .

there are some new features too , like file versions and superfech which really makes the applications load faster , somewhat (though i wouldn't say much) improved security , and 64    bit variations allow using higher amounts of memory the future apps will need , and access to more cpu registers , which should improve performance a bit  .

still , there is little you can do with vista that you couldn't with xp , and it also has some drawbacks  .

the main ones are slightly worse gui responsivness and high memory requirements (though it's not as high as it may seem when you look at task manager after booting , a lot of things are not really necessary , so vista will swap them should an application need more memory)  .

other problems you might encounter are that your older hardware might not be supported if the manufacturer chose not to write new drivers , and that not all applications are 100% compatible with the new os (mainly the system software and utilities)  .

on the overal , it's not the wow ms promissed , but if one's hardware is supported , i'd recommend vista over xp for machines with 2gb of ram or more , those with less than 1gb should forget about it , and the ones in between may consider it as it works well with 1gb , but you may want to kill a few services and turn off sidebar and aero to make the memory usage as close to xp's or 2000's as possible .

vista is better than xp  .

however , it requires a better hardware setup , as with any os iteration  .

however , it still does not perform well enough with mediocre hardware  .

with so many processes running , it is as if vista is designed only for multi core systems with gigs of ram  .

this should not have been the case for at least vista business  .

you cannot expect professionals to upgrade hardware to unnecessary specs just to accommodate a new os  .

also , vista business should have been written in such a way that if fully (100%) supports any program written for xp  .

software vendors are not rewriting for vista now , and there are not going to later  .

vista has no place in the business world , and that is sad  .

professionals will be stuck with more years of xp , and its flaws instability  .

home users will enjoy vista , but they are being tempted to os x and ubuntu  .

i guess we'll see how things pan out  .

at the end of the day , software vendors for enterprise applications indirectly control what os we use , and that is a fact  .

if they don't like vista , we wo not see it .

i installed vista business in my hp pavillian dv5220us laptop  .

it worked perfectly first at all i am impressed with its non freezing performance  .

i run about seven programmes at a time , but with just 1 gb ram it works perfectly and with enough speed another great feature which i like is automatic diver and also software installation  .

when u install a new hardware to pc it will search for driver in pc and over internet if it doesnt found it will contact directly manufacture and whole software bundle will be downloaded as windows update vista uses the minimum ram from the system , unlinke xp it runs just two or three processes from system that runs whole computer very smoothly the next thing i noticed is that while copying or moving data it shows accurate time , unlike xp that copying or moving will be finished in exact timing which that shows in case of security it has amazing wireless home network management software and fantastic firewall which is hard to break by hackers  .

and in my suggesion if u keep the pc updated regularly , u will not need any antivirus programme it shows sond settings for each software , so u can setup different volume level for every software graphic management is also nice  .

my pc shows fantastic performance on just 128 mb intel intergrated graphics  .

the aero style is really attractive and it uses very less video memory with higher performance  .

side bar and gadgets are useful and genuine the direct document preview feature is also very helpful when u start the pc , cpu will do all must require tasks , but it gives the user a first priority , so system runs very smoothly  .

thats the most appritiative feature almost all xp softwares runs with vista  .

(if u have updated the vista)  .

windows vista is stable and easy to use  .

if you follow there upgrade wizard you should have no problem installing product  .

make sure to investigate the software programs you use most frequently to see that they will be compatible with vista  .

had to spend $350  .

00 to make sure quickbooks would work with vista  .

graphics are a great improvement from xp  .

all in all i am impressed with the stability range of new social networking improvements added to vista  .

i give it a 7 .

after toying around with vista business for about 4 hours , i got frustrated enough that i ended up wiping my hard disk and reverting back to xp  .

i had made an image of the hard drive before upgrading with norton ghost so it is easy  .

i'm back on xp and frankly have no intention of upgrading in the near future , if even the distant future the appearance features weren't all that did me in , but they were the most disappointing because it had been hyped up so much as such a supposedly beautiful operating system  .

on appearance , xp's solid blues and greens are so much better than vista's 10 , 000 shades of teal , plus the grey/black for maximum nausea  .

if they wanted it to look good , the least they could have done is package some themes rather than telling users to download nonexistant themes if they didn't like the layout the flip 3d feature of aero is killed by the fact that you have to find a little button on the taskbar to use it    or do an awkward 3 key combo    so it's not convenient the way it should be other disappointments included the fact that the all programs menu in the start menu doesn't expand the way it does in xp and previous versions  .

if you want that , you have to revert to a classic theme for the start menu and taskbar , which is basically straight out of windows 2000 , so it clashes with the rest of the desktop (and it is not as convenient as xp's start menu because it only has a single column) instead , the start menu in vista just has a scrolling list of expandable folders , which is about as easy to use as if i were trying to use windows on my blackberry  .

you have to scroll up and down to find anything the user access control is one thing i thought wouldn't bother me , but it does  .

unless you turn it off , it will warn you whenever you run a program it doesn't recognize , which included something as benign as winrar  .

and there is no way i could find to flag a program as acceptable  .

it warned me about winrar several times in a row certain folders now take forever to load , for example the control panel , which even on my very fast computer takes about 5 seconds to load  .

on xp it loads right away there are now 2 startup pages instead of one  .

the second is an animation with a nice sound , but before you get there you get a black screen with (c) microsoft windows at the bottom and an ugly , puke    green progress bar where the bars aren't even evenly spaced  .

you'd think they would have at least tried to create a good presentation for the opening screen some of those things i could get used to , but the desktop appearance and ease of using the start menu are things that i consider nonnegotiable it seems like they made changes to the user interface because they felt like they ought to be making changes , not because they had any compelling reason to do so  .

this is the same feeling i got when i upgraded to ie7 , and which is why i started using firefox a few months ago after being a longtime ie enthusiast through ie 6  .

if vista does not crash and burn and force microsoft to change direction , i think xp will be the last windows i buy (i got this vista upgrade for free with my new dell laptop)  .

i love xp , i just hate vista  .

i'll go for a mac or maybe linux , if they make linux easier to use (i  .

multimedia    wise this would probably require widespread adoption of non    proprietary formats , so it's probably too far in the future) now that i think about it , the commoditization of operating systems that microsoft fears seems like it would be pretty good from a consumer perspective we need more competition in this market , especially if it can be commensurate with standarization  .

the compatibility issue is the only reason having windows as a monopoly has been good for consumers thus far , and this can be solved with standardization .

the new vostro from dell came with preinstalled vista  .

my usual approach is to load all of the software i use and then configure , a 15 to 20 hour process  .

i tried using the files and settings transfer and this just did not import or move most of my files  .

the programs that did transfer did not include my personalized settings  .

at this poin t i drpped back to the old install , item by item  .

after setting up the new system , including getting rid of those d ed nags that were popping up constantly i decided to use the disk cleanup function  .

d  again ; 20 hours down the drain  .

the program deleted over 66 , 000 files  .

all this with me looking at the screen with mouth agape ; first round to vista  .

obviously restore from the recycle bin did not work for this  .

i found an undelete program and set it to work  .

unfortunatly a few bits in most programs had been overwritten while groping around so i started reloading programs , second round to vista  .

as i dragged files from my cloned hard drive the pprogram kep flagging , not sufficient memory , even though the files were only around a 300mb size  .

now darn it , i payed for 2 gb just so this type of thing did not happen  .

now i begin to see a pattern , my programs , most , not all need to have a vista version to work  .

most drivers , the same  .

some hardware dos not have any drivers written for vista  .

there are quirks showing up  .

as i use the keyboard to step through the explorer tree in the left pane , the right hand pane does not display the contents of the folders in the right hand unless i click on the folder with the mouse  .

i spoke to dell tech support and requested a copy of xp to replace vista and they informed me the vostro 1700 is not compatable with xp  .

my new gateway may cross paths with the returning dell  .

goodby , good luck vista  .

i may revisit in another year but now , no  .

my fault , i usually allow an operating system to mature at least a full year , maybe two .

i am very disappointed in the performance of vista business  .

i bought it on a good discount through my college  .

i am a professor who built my own computer for recording and altering video files for class  .

the two main pieces of hardware i need are my pci tv tuner , and my dvd burner  .

the ati tuner wont work at all and no new updates are forthcoming , and nero doesnt work  .

nero wants me to buy their newest version so that i can keep burning to dvd so basically i built a new computer and upgraded my to vista because they are stopping support for xp  .

but i had to build a backup from my old computer to do the actual work that i just built a new computer to do  .

in the end i am still doing most of my multimedia work on my old machine now thanks to microsoft .

we purchased 2 dell inspiron 6400 laptops with 2gb of ram for our new employees  .

the system seems to launch the same as xp  .

there's this time lapse between startup screens thats somewhat odd  .

upon startup you have your usual slew of taskbar items , but no computer , documents or any type of desktop menu to access them  .

how is this supposed to make computing easier  .

for a new user these are useless and can only lead to frustration  .

i disabled windows sidebar as it too proved useless  .

why not include a system utilities gadget  .

who needs an analog clock when you have a digital one  .

only time will prove the gadgets actual useability  .

the windows aero feature seems to stall upon launching a menu item , or application  .

i'm not sure if its due to the ati x1400 graphics chipset  .

the only feature i have not disabled is uac  .

i am about to , as i have gotten complaints that any application running to include standard prebundled apps and microsoft apps , windows pops up a security screen , and freezes everything until you give the app permission to run  .

the search feature should have been placed on the taskbar like google desktop or apple spotlight the only bundled app working correctly is microsoft office 2007  .

it has not crashed , and at first throws off the average user of office , by hiding all the toolbars  .

it took some hunting to figure out how the drawing , writing , formatting , and tables toolbars were integrated into the ribbon gallery the family of vista os's is not worth their money  .

i think its insulting that microsoft should divide and conquer by charging more for the highly touted security features found in ultimate  .

those features are what a standard user should have and they should be integrated and remain out of sight until they are needed by the system  .

its no surprise sales have been tepid at best overall this upgrade is more reminiscent of windows me to 2000  .

poorly planned and executed  .

after 5 years of development to have no hardware and software support out the gate is startling  .

i am glad i have a mac at home , because i'm not convinced that paying full price for a half baked os is worth the trouble  .

and no , i am not a machead  .

i am running bootcamp at home , because i wanted the best of both worlds  .

i love the customization of xp , and the simplicity of os10  .

i expected more from microsoft .

bought a new t60 widescreen thinkpad a week ago  .

found out in quick order certain programs such as sage act  .

2006 does not work at all with vista  .

i had some issues setting up our hp office printers as well hp does not yet offer drivers for certain printer/vista combinations the sidebar eats up room and memory  .

yahoo widgets does the same thing and better imo needs more than 1gb to run well i spent the weekend installing xp pro sp2 and finding drivers for my t60 and it runs like a dream now  .

act  .

2006 works again  .

act  .

2007 claims to work but has some real operational trade    offs + costs more $$$ i'd say give it 6    12 months before you try to introduce a vista machine into a large corporate environment  .

if you own any version of act  .

before 2007 , you're sol .

i recently bought a new laptop with vista business ed , which i is very eager to adopt early , having been a huge xp fan in recent years  .

at the same time i started a new job that required me to work on an mac os for the first time  .

first off , i am not an apple fanboy , i have in fact gone to great lengths to avoid apple os's (which i rated as inferior based on short stints on os 9) in the past  .

i thoroughly regret this now my experience with os x leopard has been as rewarding as my experience with vista has been frustrating , even doubly so  .

considering the above , my very strong knowledge of and previous liking for windows xp and almost no previous experience with macs , i cannot even chalk my dislike for vista down as resistance to change i have found leopard to be intuitive , fast , secure , feature rich and incredibly productive  .

with no training whatsoever i is able to learn this new os and be at higher levels of productivity than ever , even on xp , quantifiable on paper by my work output , within the space of 2 hours  .

and this regardless of still confusing the apple key , alt key and control key all the time on the downside , there seems to be some bugs still in leopard , as my dock will display corrupt at times , and i've had one application crash once (granted , one for which support has been dropped about a year ago) my experience on vista is horrid in comparison  .

on a brand new laptop that's vista certified up and down , i have had endless problems  .

and vista consumes near 80% of my 1gb ram (granted , not earthshattering but i thought sufficient) on first boot  .

vista feels extremely sluggish on my machine , which ironically has better specs in all regards than my work machine  .

granted , i could turn aero off , but that would be like telling a four year old to sleep with a stash of candy under his pillow and never eat , touch or look at it  .

i have come across several bugs which have cost me several hours of troubleshooting and reinstalls , mostly to no avail  .

my explorer shell still mysteriously looses right click functionality at random , despite my having 100% vista cert drivers and hardware and a fully patched/updated install to mention but one pet peeve  .

i also find the security solution horrendous , a it was not me  .

approach of shifting the blame to the user by making sure the user triple confirms just about everything they do  .

other than the updated visuals and changed security policies i have not coma across any new features that warrant mention which puts the price tag right up there in the what were you smoking when you paid that for a 2 broken feature upgrade to xp category i thoroughly regret having lost so many hours of productivity in the past to my stubborn refusal to ditch msft , and will not be buying anything other than apple in the foreseeable future  .

for the sake of my sanity .

i cannot recommend that a small business use this highly buggy program until microsoft updates what is really a beta software product  .

for reasons probably best known to microsoft , vista is actually being sold as a tested product  .

incredibly vista business , installed on my dell optiflex 766 computer by dell , does not work either with microsoft office's word (also installed on the computer by the oem) most of the time , or frequently with the other components of microsoft office  .

if there is one program that you would expect not to have any issue with vista , it would be office  .

my customers keep asking , what about vista  .

so i finally broke down and attempted an installation using vista business 64    bit edition  .

i offer a few of my thoughts and my ultimate conclusion this has to be about the most attractive windows to date  .

appearance and layout is terrific and there is no denying the cool factor  .

sure , there's a bit of a learning curve  .

but that's nothing new when switching operating systems  .

security is definitely tighter and there are a number of useful features that were heretofore unavailable  .

and that's about it for the good stuff installation is a nightmare  .

i have never spent 50 hours trying to get my hardware and software installed and configured for a new o/s  .

out of our 4 office printers , only one had updated vista 64    bit drivers  .

two of the others are less than 18 months old  .

canon tells me their (almost new) imageclass d880 may never get 64    bit vista drivers  .

our hpz3100 does not have them yet either although they are promised for the future i did not fare any better on the software side  .

most antivirus products have a problem with 64    bit vista  .

even installing microsoft's own products proved to be a frustrating and sometimes impossible task  .

and forget anything without signed drivers (like hardware monitor from hmonitor  .

com)  .

total software installation success is only about 55%  .

the rest crashed and burned and after installing all the software  .

let's just say that garden variety slugs move faster than my computer does  .

everything has become a waiting game ; wait for the computer to boot up , wait for the application to open , wait for the drive access led to show something other than solid red , wait a hole minute for explorer to open up  .

wait , wait and more wait  .

i'm running a quad core 2  .

4ghz cpu with 4gb memory and an nvidia 8600gt video card on an asus striker extreme mobo for gosh sake  .

give me a break already  .

in the end , i have spent 50 hours only to abandon this ridiculous project  .

why waste time on something that clearly requires more development  .

there is no way i'll touch this thing again before sp1 arrives (now promised for february 2008)  .

perhaps even then i'll wait for good reviews before i waste any more of my precious time  .

in the meantime , it's back to xp  .

it took a few years but most of the little kinks have been ironed out of that o/s if microsoft decides to discontinue distribution of xp in favor of vista , it'll be shooting itself in the face  .

go ahead microsoft make my day .

it is infuriating to have a great printer (lexmark c524dtn) with duplex capability and not be able to duplex under vista but have to go to an xp machine to do the duplex printing  .

this is a driver issue that should have been ironed out before vista's release  .

it is even more infuriating to see that detachable disk drives by major manufacturers (e  .

iomega) are not supported under vista but are supported under xp  .

furthermore , the web sites for these devices state that these devices will not be supported in the future because of major architectural changes between vista and xp  .

this is absurd  .

we should not have to upgrade peripheral hardware every time there is a major os upgrade  .

even worse   the hardware requirements for basic satisfactory operation are substantially greater for vista than for xp  .

xp will run reasonably well on 500 mb or even less  .

vista is intolerable on 500 mb and becomes comparable performance wise to xp only at about 1  .

5 to 2  .

0 gb of memory  .

ridiculous  .

vista would never have been released in its present form if microsoft has serious competition in the os business  .

i think xp is superior to vista in its present form and will be serviceable for almost all applications for many years to come  .

microsoft should not be allowed to drop support for xp .

i recently had my business laptop die on me and replaced it with a dell loaded with vista business  .

so far , i have had major time consuming issues with outlook  .

i originally tried my outlook 2000 which is not supported  .

apparently this is because of a file called wab32  .

dll that is located in outlook express does not exist because oe has been replaced by windows mail  .

now that i am loading in outlook 2000 from the office xp suite , i am getting all kinds of error messages and warnings from vista that a program is trying to hijack my email addresses from outlook and i most certainly do not have any viruses or anything  .

you would think that somewhere along the line , the designers would have realized that people coming into vista will be using outlook 2000 or 2002 , and they seem to have done nothing to bring these business users into this new platform aside from that , the system is not really very fast , which is surprising , and it seems to have an awful lot of thinking to do  .

i know microsoft wants to create this totally new experience and the website claims like simplifying your business so you can have more fun  .

and others that are equally nauseating  .

vista has provided me with no benefits thus far .

i purchased a new computer with vista business , in anticipation of a new whiz bang operating system  .

what i ended up with is a very expensive computer that i could not use in my office network because none of my business programs would operate properly with vista  .

i had no functionality problems going from win98 up to win2000 and then going from 2000 to win xp  .

what i ended up having to do is to purchase another computer with xp pro and relegate the computer with vista to my house for my daughter to use for pictures , myspace , games and other such useless things  .

the last computer i bought i actually paid an extra $150  .

00 to get it with xp pro  .

is this what microsoft really wants  .

a way to get us business owners to pay more for xp pro  .

personally , if things do not change soon , i will become a apple/mac owner  .

i will never , never , never , use vista in any computer i purchase  .

and there are other business owners that feel the same way i do  .

be warned microsoft , you could become the best salesman for apple/mac in history .

i used this system for over a year and i found it quite annoying to use  .

anything that it useful is buried under other programs that are useless  .

it is nice to have internet explorer 7 pre    installed ; however , internet explorer 7 is one of the worst internet browsers that i have used  .

in addition , the windows defender is a nice touch to the system , but when it scans the entire system it takes between 2    3 hours to complete and it really slows down the system  .

even though it is a windows computer    microsoft office 2007 took a long time to load  .

the interface is confusing   the recycle bin , computer and documents could have been wrapped up into one  .

the battery life is quite short  .

watching internet clips , commercials , television shows and anything that is animated can become annoying   it stops and loads while your watching your program  .

overall , windows vista business is not worth purchasing .

imho windows xp is the best , most stable , easiest , most attractive operating system microsoft has ever written  .

how could they screw up vista so badly  .

i cannot find anything , i cannot easily get to anything , i don't like anything about it  .

security , separate user folders  .

administrator permission    could they make it any more obscure  .

why must they keep fixing things that do not need fixing  .

this is an upgrade  .

read that link above for a detailed look at the copy protection vista employs it's sick .

i hate this product  .

i am forced to use it at work  .

since my company upgraded to vista , my computer runs much slower and every time i have to use the internet websites virtually never load on the first try  .

i hate the look / layout of everything and the functionality of vista  .

oh and it loves to reset all my settings all the time  .

i wish we never upgraded for lack of a better term to this os  .

i want my old os back pronto  .

well that  .

s not totally true  .

my first choice would be a mac but i know that  .

ll never happen (at work) .

never buy vista , forget it , you are buying sorrow ,  .

i am amazed that ms has a system out there for business that to date does not do one thing faster or better than the previous os (xp)  .

i've yet to find an advantage over xp from a business standpoint  .

vista may be fine for home multi    media use , but for office work requiring multi    tasking and large programs , it is a snail (and i'm running 4gb ram and a 2  .

4ghz quad processor) will be switching back to xp pro .

buy an apple , os 10  .

5 it just works , and everything i wish vista should have been .

i 've had to reinstall once because it wouldn't install office 2003 (office 2007 is another story  .

control panel and all included in cp dissappeared (printers etc) , several lock ups , task mgr shows processor memeory usage , but no programs are running  .

i do not know what the hell it's doing i've only had it a week  .

i bought this new computer for increased speed and have spent all week trying to get it to work  .

i'll probably format and install xp pro .

i have not noticed any benefits of vista over xp and have only experienced numerous problems due to the fact that it is not compatible with any programs i need to run  .

i have had to use my old computer for these things , including software that i just purchased brand new  .

vista is just one big head ache .

the fact that microsoft is not embarrassed by this product , and that they can coerce every major manufacturer to recommend it , is proof that its time to move to linux .

between my daily crashes and regularly losing my emails as they're being written , what really sent me over the edge is being asked 30 times on whether or not i would 'allow' for an application to be installed  .

die in a fire microsoft .

the worst os i have ever used  .

not for the average computer user  .

maybe not for anyone  .

i am currently out of the country , when i return to the states i will have vista completely deleted from my computer and will find windows xp somewhere and have it installed  .

if vista cannot be completely deleted i will file this dell computer in file 13 .

vista business edition is missing hardware drivers and many functions common to xp users  .

many of my games and applications will not run and worse cannot be uninstalled properly afterward trying to find a file you don't know the name of becomes an exercise in frustration if you have a choice do not bother with vista .

before you buy vista business edition , just check whatever you use like printer , internet because none of the things supports in this advance version  .

microsoft does not bothered how existing system works .

big fat bloat ware , rediclious system reqs , this is crapware , dont feed bill , your pentium 3 is still usable , use ubuntu , or get os x  .
