Fits my Samsung fridge.
Easy to replace.
This OEM filter works perfectly as expected.
It supplies great tasting water and removes many toxins, according to the literature that accompanies them.
Fit perfectly in my fridge.
No leaks and the water tastes great.
This is the OEM filter.
It removes contaminants and lead according to the literature, and it does improve the taste.
I use the water for my coffee, tea, home made soda [Sodastream], and drinking water.
Very satisfied with the taste.
I also make a habit of replacing these whenever the "replace light" comes on.
