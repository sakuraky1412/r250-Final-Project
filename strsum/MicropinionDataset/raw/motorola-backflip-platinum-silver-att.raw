Pros:. Photo quality, loads of apps, fast, easy to use, user friendly, highly customizable 5 home screens, excellent call quality and sound.. 
Cons:. The only thing I've noticed that is not that great is the battery life, but it's the same as any smart phone I've used. I just charge it up nightly.. 
Summary:. I was highly skeptical about getting this phone because of the negative reviews, but I'm glad I went with my initial feeling and got the phone. I love it, it does everything I need it to do, and I am a power user, and it has not messed up on me once. I know there is a big gripe about users waiting on the OS upgrade to 2.1 but I am completely fine with 1.5 for the mean time, it's running great for me and I know I'm sure the upgrade will come in time Motorola said they are still working out some bugs. I've been a BlackBerry user and switching to this phone, I know I've made a good switch.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unique design, easy to use, love the way android operates (especially 5 home screens), all the good apps worth downloading are available, sturdy keyboard with light keys, fast browser when on wifi, motoblur is cool, and it is just a great phone.. 
Cons:. None really. I mean if you are a complete nerd like some of the people on here, and expect everything from your phone then maybe there are problems, but I have yet to experience them.. 
Summary:. "I'm worried about the keyboard durability" -cnet..... are you trying to f*** the phone? Although a vag is one thing the phone is missing, but that's about it. If you are a normal human being, and not a nerd who uses every single app on the cell phone to the max, then this phone will be fine for you. I felt the need to write a review somewhere for the normal people, so I can let them know that this phone works great; unless, like I said, you have no life, and worry more about "1.5 android software" than say going out on a friday night and meeting a nice girl to take home.. But that is just my opinion. This phone perfectly performs every task I ask it to, and then some. It is a great design, and long story short I have completely forgot about my Blackberry Curve.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best social networking phone ever. Features are great. Keyboard easy and durable. Perfect For Self Portrait.. 
Cons:. Battery Life isnt the best on the market but to be expected, and it still isnt that bad. Sometimes laggish but rarely.. 

$$;
Pros:. new design. keyboard layout and size. resistve touch screen. 
Cons:. FAT. SLOW. BULKY. HEAVY. HOT. 
Summary:. the good part of this phone is that it is also a handy heater/hot plate/cooker/ microwave..... the back heats up enough to perform the functions mentioned above... :(. i dont mind the cons.... the pros rokkk... so 5 stars... give it a try. for 499 bucks its *****.... but 100 bucks (att) roks !!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything.. 
Cons:. None for me.. 
Summary:. This is a great phone to get, especially for people who like messaging friends and updating their statuses. It's for people who like to connect and socialize unlike people who like how it looks or bragging about how cool it is but turns out they hate it. So for you Socializers out there, get this and for the dumb ones who buy it and end up not liking it must like bragging and being a Failure.. 

$$;
Pros:. Constant update from Twitter, Facebook, Myspace and my email. All the apps also make this phone awesome. phone took amazing pictures in the dark thanks to the really bright LED flash. It also came with a 2GB card to store my pictures and video on.. 
Cons:. Battery life is absolutley horrible but it does a whole bunch of stuff. you cant have your cake and eat it to.. 
Summary:. it is by far the best all around phone that there is. I think that you can compare this to the iPhone. The only that that this thing cant do that iPhone do is directly connect with iTunes but thats why you get an iPod. This fone does have horrible battery life but if you think about all that it does it shouldnt get horrible battery life. I normally can barley go a day but I use pandora most of the day and browse the internet and play with some of the awesome apps that i have downloaded for free. This thing is an amazing multitasker. But if you use it heavy expect it to die sometime in the day. But remember that you cant have your cake and eat it to. Do not bash this phone because you think its stupid or not as good as the Motorola Droid. This phone is for a different audience. I think that it is more for teens that are all about staying in touch with their friends and texting. Nothing more really.. Like I said before. This fone has more than fulfilled my needs and expectations!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Social networking workhorse. I have never been able to respond this quick to so many different statuses, photos, notes, links etc.... BACKTRACK touchpad is intuitive and well placed.. Hi-Quality camera on-board.. 
Cons:. Design aspect takes getting used to.. Out-of-box battery life is mediocre until you adjust the settings.. Accessories like well suited cases are hard to come by (will change with time).. 
Summary:. So far I haven't found problems I'm not able to fix by adjusting a setting or finding an app or widget for. Some might say the on-screen touch keyboard is too small. I have big hands (ring size 13) and I can easily type well aided by a word prediction bar that appears as you type. Remember that Swype is coming soon which could also help the fat-fingered alike.. Widgets enhance MOTOBLUR's supreme integration of your desired news, unified message box and response capabilities giving you multiple avenues for resolving your social life/keeping up to date on the world...all this without segregating yourself to one app at a time (iPhone). This phone has without a doubt decreased my effort needed to keep up with my co-workers, friends and POI's I want to maintain strong communication with.. Once update to Android 2.1 comes out (which Motorola is adamant about releasing) this phone's capabilities will be phenomenal, especially if Multi-touch is added to the feature list. My dream for this phone: the integration of Multi-touch with BACKTRACK.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great feel to the device, nice bright display, excellent direct sun visibility, MOTOblur interface and overall form factor is great.. 
Cons:. It's too early to tell but it seems that battery life could be better. 
Summary:. I admit I was skeptical on the the Backflip. I bought one on Sunday anyway and planned to return it in the 30 day window.. After using it for the last few days, I love the phone. I thought the keyboard being on the outside would be a bad thing, actually I like it. It gives the device a secure feeling when holding it. Because you are not just holding a plastic backing it feels very secure in your hand. The keyboard is slightly recessed and almost feels like a grip. The metal body also gives the phone a great feel and it doesn?t show fingerprints. The display is incredibly responsive and is capacitive not resistive. The camera faces you when the keyboard is open and makes for great self-portrait shots. I have picked up typing on the keyboard very quickly and I have no issues with the keyboard at all.. All in all, this phone was a pleasant surprise for me. I do not play games and such on a portable device so the performance on this phone has been more than adequate for me. I like the narrow (candybarish) dimensions and the thickness is about right. This device is only ever so slightly thicker than the Pure I was using prior. I have owned three iPhones and two other Android phones (G1 and myTouch) and I am much happier with the Backflip than any other phone I have owned.. The whole Yahoo instead of Google is not of much concern for me. I already changed my browser to default to Google as the home page. I never really use the widget search bar anyway. I am also confident that some hacks will take care of changing the default back to Google soon enough. I also do most of my searches in wikipedia and there is an app for that.. I am pleasantly surprised by how much I am enjoying the blur interface as well. No real complaints there either. Sure, there are a few things that can improve but nothing is perfect. Time will take care of any minor issues.. Yes, it could have a faster processor but for my needs it doesn?t seem to be an issue. The phone feels solid and the keyboard should hold up as well as any other candybar phone with a keypad does. I am definitely happy with this purchase.. I?m not trying to convince anyone to buy the Backflip, just wanted to give my opinion after using it for a few days.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keypad is large and easy to use. Takes great photos, in the short time I've had this phone I've taken several photos and printed them out. They came out awesome! The phone is very easy to use I've use just about all the apps and it's fast!. 
Cons:. I have nothing negitive to say about this phone.. 
Summary:. I'm not sorry that I got this phone. Comments made on this site wasn't all true, this phone is better then what was said! I've spoken to 3 other people I know who has this phone as well and their all very happy with it too! Great phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. 5 MP camera, big buttons, good touch screen.. 
Cons:. Had to turn off the track pad, sometimes the device is laggy, had several dropped calls since I've gotten the phone, buttons hard to push.. 
Summary:. It's a great phone, really. I enjoy the camera and the keyboard (when it cooperates). I am satisfied with the 2 day battery life (it's a smart phone, what do you expect?). Uses a standard Mini-USB plug, which I own several of already. I'm the envy of my friends, supposedly.. If you are looking for a simple android phone, this is a great phone for a low price. If you are looking for a business phone, try the Blackberry, Droid, or iPhone instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool design, great camera, camera has flash, can customize what you want on each screen.. 
Cons:. Does get slow but by getting an app killer and deleting texts regularly it runs fine, took some time to get used to, somewhat difficult to text on touch screen.. 
Summary:. I was looking for a different kind of phone with a qwerty keyboard. I saw this phone and thought it looked cool and interesting. At first it was a little confusing but like anything else after you use it for awhile, it becomes easy to use. It does get slow and lag, but I downloaded an app killer and that took care of the problem for the most part. It seems it runs slower when there are a lot of texts in the inbox. I wasn't really concerned with how good the camera was on my phone but the camera on this phone takes great pictures. I was also hapy it has a flash. I like the fact that you can put whatever you want on your "home screen" like texts weather etc. It is a little difficult to texts on the touch screen but I mostly use the keboard so it really isn't a big deal to me. There is supposed to be an update for android 2.1 so hopefully any problems will be resolved with the update, overall I love the phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Has several APPs to choose from. Holds signal pretty well, and wifi capabilities are great. Takes excellent pictures with flash also.. 
Cons:. Battery life seems to be getting shorter, also sluggish at times. Sometimes I have to go in and shut the phone down and bringing it back online takes quite a bit of time. Not a really speedy phone.. 
Summary:. I really like my motorola back flip. Seems to be a very dependable phone. Haven't had any problems with it so far. It seems to be very easy to use and features have been simple to figure out. I would recommend the phone to anyone who likes gadgets, but if you are looking for simplicity do not buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the look, the feel and the keyboard. Really like that I can customize the homepages. Great features and excellent sound quality. The camera takes beautiful pics.. 
Cons:. The battery drains very quickly if you use phone for more than talking. A lot apps "force close." One annoying thing is that trying to answer the phone can be tricky at times. I've missed more than a few calls because of the slide-to-answer feature.. 
Summary:. I like more about the phone than I dislike. I'm certainly not unhappy that I bought it.. 

$$;
Pros:. The sensitivity of the screen is amazing. It feels like my ipod touch. It's very precise. The screen looks so crisp, HD looks great. Android is a huge plus, apps are really neat. Sound is crisp clear and it takes NEAT pictures.. 
Cons:. Phone is a bit heavy, but it's no big deal... it heats up a bit also if you try to use it while charging, but that's just like every phone... No other con for me, I really really like this phone, and god knows I'm picky :). 
Summary:. The lack of 2.0+ firmware is just a bit saddening but it is honestly no big deal considering all you can do with this phone. It might take a bit of time to adapt and find out where everything is, but once you do, it helps you so much. Heck, now I don't have to keep a million membership cards in my wallet anymore! It does everything android does : everything, except microwave and laundry cleaning. For those who complain about not knowing which apps run in the back, well, there's an app (oh irony), who lets you check that, and close the apps running in the back and draining your battery. The phone even becomes a night clock when you plug it in and flip it on your night stand!. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is extremely customizable, has a very responsive touch screen, the backtrack is really awesome for surfing web pages, it basically eliminates the need to zoom in while surfing. Ridiculous amounts of synchronization.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be a tad better, a little confusing at first what with all the sync-ing options.. 
Summary:. I really like the phone so far, I know it doesnt have the newest OS available (there will be an update in the near future) and I know its not an Iphone, but as far as features this phone is incredible. I love the setup, easy to navigate, easy to customize once you get the hang of it. Like I said previously, so much synchronization its insane; google contacts, email, myspace, facebook, twitter, you name it, one inbox, and all the contacts in your contact list. Motoblur is taking some time to get used to, but I really think some of the features on this phone are extremely innovative. If you want to spend $300 on an IPhone, I say go for it. But if you want an affordable phone and use social networking sites, this is definitely the phone for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, easy to enhance, nice keyboard, nice interface, good integration with web apps, nice camera.. 
Cons:. Small screen, only 5 desktops?. 
Summary:. I bought this phone for my wife, a distinctly "NON-Smartphone" user. I got her the phone so that she would start using email, and it has worked! She had gotten to the point where she wasn't turning on her computer at home, or using email at work, but now, with the simple integration afforded by having a gmail account, she's doing email! The phone therefore has met and in fact exceeded expectations. It was simple to find and add new apps, throw out all the AT&#38;T stuff they "preinstalled" on the desktop.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blur puts everything important on a single screen (new messages from multiple mail boxes, texts, facebook updates, customizable to anything you want to add as a icon shortcut), plus weather, clock, .... It's awesome.. 
Cons:. Nothing bad to say, just the 2 minor setup issues that were resolved after looking at the moto forum.. 
Summary:. Blur puts everything important on a single screen (new messages from multiple mail boxes, texts, facebook updates). It's awesome. I had 2 configuration issues that were easily resolved (gmail has to be added as an email account to show up in the universal inbox, my blur contact was merged with my husbands- there's an edit option and link/unlink opton on the contact so I was able to change my name and unlink me from his facebook account).. Cool how you can stand it up for an alarm clock or to play music. Speakers sound pretty good. Keyboard is easy to use for me. I perfer it to no physical keyboard and it has the trackpad on the back (you can disable it if you don't like it).. Bottom line. I love this product mostly because of the universal inbox &#38; messages from any service all on my home screen along with facebook updates, plus customization on this screen, so I added my husband's icon so I can call him from this screen as well. Plus it has all the expected things already there on this blur screen like weather and the clock and easy navigation to apps. Fun to have google maps with gps that works finally. Market place has lots of free downloads. I'm pleasantly surprised with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. medium size front and back camera access to a lot of apps.nice screen full keyboard.. 
Cons:. at&#38;t neutering! android 1.5 upgrade to 2.1 is delayed till beginning of Q4 not upgrade to 2.2 froyo! and if you are not a U.S. no upgrade at all.. 
Summary:. good phone bad AT&#38;T slow motorola upgrade. 

$$;
Pros:. Threaded text messaging, email access to multiple accounts, social networking, Android OS, customizable notification sounds, 5MP camera with flash, Backtrack, huge keyboard.. 
Cons:. Processor, AT&#38;T restrictions, microphone when recording video.. 
Summary:. The Motorola Backflip is a pretty decent phone. I love the Android OS and can't wait to see what the 2.1 update will do since this is my first Android based phone, but what doesn't make sense is that a phone isn't sent out brand new with 2.1 already have been released. Text messaging is threaded and to me that is a must. It does load kind of slow, but it is nothing too slow that makes you sit there and wait for a few minutes for it all to load. I have to have email and since this is a smart phone it does give access to multiple accounts and even has a universal mailbox which shows messages from all of your email accounts, messages on facebook, text messages, etc. all in one box.. This phone comes loaded with Motorola's Motoblur which opens up a new quick way to access all of your social networking. I haven't used it all that much but I grasped the idea of it and it is something amazing for all of you social network geeks. One thing on the past few phones I have had has been that you could not customize your notification(text, email) sounds with out some sort of manipulation that voids a warranty. This feature is new and I enjoy having that kind of power on my phone.. The 5MP camera works great so far for the past week I've had it. Over 100 pictures taken and I can't say that I've had any disappointments with it. Of course, this is a phone and not a camera. The flash works great and takes great pictures in low light areas. I haven't used the camcorder feature much, but It does take great video. The sound isn't all that great though. The only microphone is one you make calls with and usually when you take video, the phone will be closed at that microphone will be facing away from the person or thing you are recording.. The Backtrack is a touch pad device on that back of the touchscreen. It works pretty well and works just as a touch pad on a laptop would. Scroll around items and double tap to choose, simple as that. The keyboard is very big and the surface is flat. Personally, I like this and the fact that there isn't much feedback from the keys when pressed. I've been using the iPhone for two years and this almost mimics the flat, no feedback when pressed that I've been used to for so long. The Android on screen keyboard is small, but responds well. Auto correct and predictive texting works great though I use the physical keyboard more than anything. Landscape texting isn't bad either.. The battery isn't bad at all. I've read that most people complain about it. Go to settings and set it to smart mode, don't have all kinds of constant auto-updating social widgets such as Myspace, Facebook, and Twitter. Those are killers I'm sure. One morning I left at 5am with a full battery and the phone didn't die until 9am the next morning. I text almost all day and receive several emails that were checked and replied to that same day. Personally, I don't see anything wrong with it. Smart mode is a very nicely added feature to the phone's power settings.. For the touchscreen: nothing much really. It works and doesn't lag unless the processor is being overloaded.. Some things that I do dislike about the phone is the fact that AT&#38;T has placed restrictions on leaving the phone to be an open source like Android is meant to be. I think it is ridiculous that they have to have such things happen. For one, it is MY phone and open source means user customization to MY preference.. At times the phone does get slow. Most apps don't auto kill themselves so I bought an app that allows me to task manage. It does free up space but sometimes programs like that can cause problems so you have to be careful using them. The processor could be better, but I think the main problem is having so many constant active widgets.. Overall I like this phone. 4/5 *s. AT&#38;T's restrictions and lack of a faster processor, and no current support for a software version that has been released before the phone's release keeps me from giving this phone 5/5 *s.. Definitely a phone to buy if you want a smart phone that isn't hard to adapt to and use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Touchscreen, Keypad, Camera, Apps. 
Cons:. Battery, Limited on Accessories, Freezes some. 
Summary:. This phone is a decent phone. Had a little trouble with it in the beginning when I first purchased it. The touchscreen is really touchy and the keypad is really nice to have. The camera 5mp and has a flash which for a phone is really good quality. There is quite a few free apps you can download for this phone. The battery life is not so good on it though, but I believe that may be the same thing with any type of smartphone. Its limited on accessories because there is not many things you can buy for the phone as in cases and such, but then again it is a newer phone and that stuff takes time. In the beginning I had a lot of problems with it freezing but I've had it for a while now and its not doing as much as it was in the beginning when I first purchased the phone. Overall it is a really nice phone to have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unique "Backflip" Design. Android OS. "Backtrack" trackpad on back of screen. Motoblur interface. Durable keyboard. 
Cons:. AT&#38;T exclusive. uncovered keyboard. Slow loading speeds. even slower camera. Makes iPhone's battery look like a car battery. 
Summary:. This is a phone that in my eyes, is the border between phones like the LG Chocolate Touch or Samsung Instinct and smartphones. It has styling and power of a "3G enhanced phone" and a smartphone OS. I recommend it for teens and college students.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Android/Google Phone. - A good touchscreen device. - Ability to connect to social networks (could be a con). - Light, slim, and very stylish. - Fast and efficient phone that can do more than just customizing and personalizing itself. 
Cons:. - The anticipation for the Android update from 1.5 to 2.1. - Do a little research on AT&#38;T; it may very well be the service provider you may not be fond of.. -3G is limited. 
Summary:. 03-29-10. First and foremost, please be aware that I am just your regular cell phone user from AT&#38;T. While I may be inexperienced with how to review "smart-phones", I have come to learn a few things about the Motorola Backflip through my own personal experience with it. Also note that I've only had this phone for less than a month.. What I truly love about the Backflip is the overall interface. It's fast, responsive, and great to toy with. The touchscreen interface is, in my opinion, probably just as good as an Iphone! However, because this is an outdated version of the Android, I am well aware of the bugs that weren't fixed in this version, which could possibly affect the phone's performance. But in defense, I have yet to see this perform sluggishly when scrolling down menus or opening apps after apps.. I'm not sure why Cnet gave a mediocre review on the camera that the Bacflip possesses. First of, that "...quite a bit of lag when starting the camera..." is how it has always started. You're suppose to hold down the dedicated camera button in order to bring out the application for it. This was probably put in so people wouldn't have to accidentally draw out the camera application. For Quality, this does pretty good: all you have to do is point-and-shoot (mind you that the camera does have to focus and then take the shot. But all cameras do that as well!) For the video, I'll just let you judge for yourself: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hv59ALCjqOQ. But what this phone is known for is it's socializing capabilities such as going on Facebook and Twitter. All this can be done in an application called Happenings. Basically, you log onto your accounts on these socializing networks, and what Motorblur will do for you is sync all your friends from all your socializing networks and sync them with your contacts list. BIG TURN OFF. The problem with this is that sometimes the phone can't recognize if certain people are the same person or not. In my case, I had 3 specific contacts that shared the same name(mainly because it is the same person), but was added separately instead of synchronizing itself with the existing name. Maybe a few more fixes and this will catch on, but as of now, I wouldn't recommend them using this as their selling point. What I did was instead of using the Happenings application, I downloaded the Facebook application for free from the Market and am using that instead of the Happening application. I may not get notifications as fast, but at least my contacts is nice and clean once again.. For now, this phone is a good contender in the smart-phone war. Let's see what else it can do in the near future once this baby is packed and loaded with the Android 2.1 version. Once I've got that and played with it for about a month, I'll rewrite my review. For now, 4 stars for you love!. 

$$;
Pros:. took a little while to figure the phone out. like that i'm connected to all my accounts. the camera takes awesome pictures and call quality is better than my HTC pure by far especially on speakerphone. very easy to use once you get used to using it.. 
Cons:. battery life really sucks definitely need a car charger, but recharges pretty quick. Screen size is a little small and have had some minor glitches in the screen itself being very pixelated at times just reboot the phone.. 
Summary:. Awesome upgrade phone especially with the $100 rebate so you pay nothing for the phone. Been an at&#38;t wireless customer for years and have never had any issues with customer service at all. I can see why this phone gets sold out quickly. the only issue with it is the battery life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, good screen quality, good camera. 
Cons:. Addictive, spend all of your time downloading rediculous apps only to delete them. :). 
Summary:. I have had the phone for 3 days. Have no problems with it. I have already downloaded over 100 apps (some good some bad). The phone is relatively easy to use. Keyboard isn't nearly as bad as some nmake it out to be, but it does take some getting used to if you are used to using a full touch screen phone. I would not recomend this phone if you are a current smart phone user. If you are upgrading from a non-smart phone it is ok though. Over all good first android for ATT.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, full keyboard, backtrack feature, 5MP camera, 3.5mm headset jack, Android market. 
Cons:. No cover for usb port. 
Summary:. Nice phone. Better to buy from Walmart for FREE with a 2-year contract (new or renewal). That's a big savings from the AT&#38;T store and you don't have to wait for a rebate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android, keyboard, Camera, google maps and of course MOTOBLUR!!!. 
Cons:. Battery life AT&#38;T being evil and giving me crappy yahoo searches have to make a bookmark icon for google so i can use google on a google phone. 
Summary:. I love the phone because its not a dreaded Iphone had one went through three (hate apple lol) Android is the future and fell this phone will get better in time. Love the apps love Motoblur software thought i would hate it but it became easy to use love the clear hi res screen you-tube videos are really clear love the camera its nice. The thing i hate is the battery life it cant keep up with me and apparently everyone hopefully the upgrade to 2.1 fixes things. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool, flexible design, Android, good build, display, feel. 
Cons:. A bit slow, long time to start, small screen. 
Summary:. I've had this phone for about one month and I've liked it very much. It's my first Android phone, nad I like the OS a lot; however I know that I'm missing out on some cool features that are in later versions.. The build is very good and the reverse hinge design is cool and easy to use. The keyboard is also good, but the virtual keyboard is only suitable for 2 year olds, who aren't likely to be using mobile phones and are also not Motorola's target audience.. The Market is really satifying and the browser is OK. Calls are very good and the Motoblur is good too. However, the phone takes a lot of time to boot up and is a little slow when you are scrolling on lists.. 

$$;
Pros:. Full keyboard is nice, back lit, and easy to type on. Touch screen works well and the 5 windows are enough. Phone quality is great on both ends. Nice speakers on the phone. can create its own stand for watching video or in clock mode.. WiFi. nice camera. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better maybe a day and 1/2 with moderate use.. Android 1.5 (but then again, I don't know the difference). AT&#38;T bloatware. Charging cord is a little short. 
Summary:. I came from a old flip phone, so this blew me away.I think the 5 windows are more than enough. I usually don't need instant access to the application in any case. The phone does a nice job of syncing all your Gmail and Facebook contacts, but it can create duplicates. A little time linking up the contacts is not too much to ask. At times the phone can be a little laggy, but I haven't ran into a computer device that doesn't have the occasional hiccups. It is a solid mid-grade smart phone device that has a physical workable keyboard. The Motoblur software has its pros and cons, but overall it does a nice job of updating for those that cannot be a second behind in the update that their friend had a turkey sandwich for lunch. It is geared for the virtual friend ******, but it is a phone I don't think an adult would be embarrassed to use.. I don't find the screen too small, and anyone that does is just used to the megatron screen real estate that seems to be the norm now. Personally I find it refreshing not to pull a laptop out of my pocket. The delayed OS updates are only annoying in that they have to develop them with Motoblur in mind, and that Cnet thinks anything over 2 months old is the equivalent of a Commodore 64. It is worth the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sturdy phone, with a great keyboard and a more than adequate camera. Android 1.5 is better than no android, and the SD card memory functionality is great.. 
Cons:. Cons are a bit too long for the 250 characters allowed here. Read the first paragraph in the bottom-line summary.. 
Summary:. ATT lobotomized the android platform. Google search has been replaced with yahoo, which is disgusting. And they've prevented users from installing any apps that were downloaded anywhere but the android market. (There IS a way around this, so research it!) Motorola failed to include the newest versions (or even relatively new) of Android, giving us 1.5 instead of the newer 2.1 or higher. Hopefully they'll have software updates for us soon.. For die hard (or simply stuck with) ATT customers, the backflip is great. Specifically because it's the only android phone ATT has available. (unless you get an unlocked phone.) Regardless of it's three major crippling features (Yahoo Search, lack of ability to install non-app store apps, and non-updated android) it's still a far sight better than the highly restrictive platform that is the Iphone, and has greater functionality than the available blackberries. There is still hope that Motorola will roll out software updates to get us to the newer Android platforms, which will make the phone far better, but until ATT releases a patch to fix the yahoo search and app installs this will remain a substandard phone. Lots of available information on the backflip at the backflip forums. Any search engine should be able to find them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Affordable (with contract), I like the flip design, physical keyboard, expandable micro sd memory and Android.. 
Cons:. Not sure why AT&#38;T forces you into using their preinstalled software or why yahoo is the default search with no way to change (reeks of Apple) camera slow to capture pics, Still can't store apps to SD without getting all hacky.. 
Summary:. Calling this phone slow seems to be unfair as it is an entry level android phone. It obviously can't compare to the droid in the horsepower department. Performance has been no slower than my iphone 3g (except the camera). Though the android os may not be as slick as the iphone, being able to have widgets constantly running on your "desktop" and having some apps be able to run in the background more than makes up for any clunkyness in the user interface. State of the art it may not be, but the backflip is a solid and affordable smart phone. I just hope a future update will allow us to get rid of the at&#38;t bloat-ware...don't hold your breath.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the backflip.ii love the text messaging!I like the camera and video because u can flip the screen and see yourself...that's magnificent!The internet is good!. 
Cons:. Ok..problems ii have with it is freezing!it freezes everytime ii get more than 1 text message.that's very nerve-working!they need to fix that!another problem is that it unexpectly turns off!that also ticks me off!that's the onlt problems!. 
Summary:. Bottom-line..I would recommend this phone to others!its probably the best phone UNDER the iphone.and I think with all its spectacular features and fix those problems...it has the potential to be the next competitor of the iphone!. 

$$;
Pros:. Moto-Blur, Android, 3G, Screen Resolution, Widgets, Form Factor, Physical Keyboard, Calling Quality, Signal Strength, Tens of Thousands of Apps, and the over-all feel of the phone.... 
Cons:. Internal Storage, Camera, Lagginess, AT&#38;T's pre-installed apps (that no one will use, but it will take up a good amount of your internal storage), Old Version of Android (1.5 while the latest version is 2.1). 
Summary:. This is a good phone if your upgrading from a feature phone, but If you're looking for power, look elsewhere. The over-all design of the "unusual" form factor proves to be a success, because since the sliding mechanism is replaced by the hinge, you have more space for the keyboard. Since the form factor brings the phone to an (almost) acrobatic ability, there is something called the "Table-Top" mode which when the phone is cocked to a 90 - 45 degree angle, it displays an alarm clock with the weather with dimming capabilities and photo-frame capabilities.. Motorola's software, Moto-Blur, brings all social networking sites to you at your home screen, (to learn more visit Motorola's website). This feature proves to be very useful if you have multiple social networks, other than that it may not prove anymore useful than just opening a social networking app that you downloaded from the on-board app store. Android looks beautiful on this device, but as far as it runs, it could be way better. Speaking of which, the speed of the phone is nearly mediocre. It is somewhat responsive, but opening apps could be more speedy, and the phone will sometimes freeze. Even though this is native to the iPhone, I believe the phone would be worth 4 stars if they made it faster, (For example; The Motorola Backflip carries a 528 MHz processor, while the Nexus 1 carries a 900 MHz). Other than that, the phone feels very solid and fits right into your hand. The call quality was AMAZING! It sounded like i was on a land-line and the people who I was calling thought I was on a land line, and the speakerphone quality was amazing it could be paralleled to a computer! In addition to good speakerphone quality, the speaker sounded great when playing music or watching videos, but of course there is the 3.5 mm headset jack, (which basically means that you can use regular headphones instead of needing an attachment). Also, the radio on the device was phenomenal. I could get a signal in places where before, I have not. And, because of that, the internet speed was pretty darn quick.. Sometimes the device can be a little laggy, and not as responsive as the iPhone or Nexus 1. The phone has a serious problem with internal storage. There's only so much space on the device that you would have to use a storage card for the pics and other media, while the apps (can only) stay on the device. Another thing I want to note is that the camera app seems to freeze (sometimes) while in use, and automatically shuts down the entire phone. After about a couple days of use, it's VERY annoying and I'm definitely willing to return it because I use my camera a lot.. 

$$;
Pros:. Vivid colors, love the texting windows. 
Cons:. Randomly re-boots, touch screen too sensitive, begins to lag over time, reaction time to touch is getting horrible, buttons aren't easy to press making texting/typing difficult/. 
Summary:. Day 29: the phone randomly rebooted on 4 different occasions. Progressively gets worse....today, Day 40, it has already rebooted 11 times, all within a 2 and a half hour time frame, all while trying to text and share pics.... OMG... so VERY frustrating, I cannot wait to get another phone! Other cons: touch screen too sensitive (I inadvertently call people while using it, and I accidentally hang up on calls when my face touches the screen), within the first month gradually lagged more and more, now reaction time to touching is very slow... I touch the screen and when it doesn't react I'll touch again (and sometimes again) and then it finally catches up all at once....therefore going way past the point in which I intended to be. WARNING: You must have lots of patience to continue loving this phone!. 

$$;
Pros:. well, the Pros to me are the fact that its got a great responding touch screen, awesomely neat social networking from the front of the phone. Great wifi reception and the web browser is decent..... 
Cons:. BATTERY LIFE IS NOT WHAT IT IS BILLED TO BE- My battery after charging a full night- I mean 8 1/2 hours and the battery is dead by lunch time (12:00) So, I guess in order to save battery life I need to put it on airplane mode???. 
Summary:. Bottom line, I enjoy this phone considering I had the LG Neon which is a great qwerty phone, I was looking for more of a touch screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. good customization, decent price, keyboard is large. 
Cons:. battery life,. 
Summary:. I've been trying this phone for a week now. My old phone was an old flip phone so this seems pretty incredible to look up things on the internet and send emails. I didn't like it when I went to sleep and the phone had run out of battery and like they say the keyboard could be a little better. somewhat hard to input but decent. I prefer it to the iphone on screen keyboard.. There are newer phones that are fast and have more features but i'm sure they cost more to the 50$ i paid for this one.. A good basic "droid" phone. 

$$;
Pros:. Motoblur and happenings widget, universal inbox, contact syncing. 
Cons:. Slightly sluggish responsiveness, tiring keyboard, small screen for text viewing. 
Summary:. This is a perfect phone for someone young or just looking to keep in touch w/ people. I loved it for that purpose. I only have FB and I ended up always talking w/ people and I like how it syncs w/ those contacts so I have everyone's email/phone info. The keyboard is kind of hard to type on b/c you have to PRESS the buttons since they're so flat. The Android marked it so extensive it's hard to just browse and find good stuff. The phone is also a bit slick and I have to focus for it not to slip out my hand. Feels kind of cheap sometimes. BackTrack is cool but not too practical when there's already the touch screen and keypad...to use it I have to hold the phone a certain way and its not that responsive either. Again, great phone for keepin in touch w/ social networking but otherwise.....I'll pass since I already come from a Blackberry lineup.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone keeps you conneceted with facebook, twitter, and other social networking built in. Also the Clock feature is a really nice touch.. 
Cons:. Battery life is horrible, not since my 8525 have I worried about my phone dying overnight. Also I haven't been able to answer a call yet, everytime someone calls and I can manage to get the "slide to answer" to work, I am greeted with silence.. 
Summary:. This would be a great phone to introduce people to the world of smartphones, the Android OS is alot better than what I remember microsoft having. However, I purchased this phone after I had an iPhone for almost 2 years. This phone just doesn't come close to being as easy to use as an iPhone in my opinion.. This phone also seems to go into standby really quickly, and this is after I adjusted the standby time to 2 minutes. It appears that in some parts of the OS the phone ignores your settings and shuts the screen down, but this may have to do with the limited battery life.. The physical keyboard is nice for typing out longer emails or blog posts.. Ultimately this phone will help you understand why Apple is so peticular about how features are implimented on the iPhone. Just because you can do something doesn't always mean that its done well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera, Backtrack, Keyboard, Social Networking. 
Cons:. Battery, Operating System, Freezes, Glitchy, What AT&#38;T has done to the Android on this phone. 
Summary:. This phone overall is a regret and if I had the extra money I would replace. I do not like the Motoblur operating system, it is always freezing and restarting its self. The fact that it is still on 1.5 android version is rather ridiculous since when I bought it I was told that it was going to be upgradeable soon and 6 months is not soon. Lastly, the move by AT&#38;T to strip the phone with many of the signature Android apps and abilities and filling it up with unremovable AT&#38;T bloatware was not a smart move at all!. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the form factor. It's fairly light but feels solid. No problem at all with the externally-facing keyboard. Outdoor photos look fine.. 
Cons:. Older OS version means limited and unstable apps. Poor battery life. Unstable and crash-prone. Indoor photos are bad, even with LED "flash".. 
Summary:. Look, the reason you want an Android phone is so that you have access to the wide array of third-party apps without being locked in to Apple's restrictive developer policies. Android is an open system, the major benefit of which is more access to cool toys and, for more techie folks, a sandbox to play in.. For some mind-bending reason, either AT&#38;T or Motorola chose to build this thing around the 1.4 version of Android which NOBODY WRITES APPS FOR. Want the new Kindle app for Android? Nope, only on newer Android versions. Map software? Wordpress? Facebook? Twitter? Text-to-speech? Games? Too bad...there are lots of apps out there, but for the most part, all I've found in the marketplace are bottom-shelf, unstable or reduced functionality apps. It's not the developers' fault--it's the old Android implementation.. Second gripe: AT&#38;T loads it up with bloatware that you can not uninstall, and if you open once, will be charged a monthly fee for. The menu is littered with junk that you can not get rid of, can not hide, and can not folder.. Third gripe: it crashes randomly a few times a week. Sometimes when using third party apps, but usually doing something tricky like making a phone call or opening the menu screen.. Fourth gripe: The battery only lasts half a day, even if I don't use it at all--no WiFi, no GPS, no bluetooth. Just phone/data turned on, with the phone in my pocket not being used, if I turn it on at 7AM it'll be dead and shutting down by 7PM.. Fifth gripe: there is no way to turn off or control apps without downloading a third party app manager.. I'm pretty fed up with this phone. I was already locked into AT&#38;T, so I was excited to see that they had an Android phone, but man, did they screw this up. I wish I had waited another month and gotten an iPhone4. It has issues, but nothing even close to this tin toy.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the android platform. The pop up keyboard works well, and I often use it in place of the physical keyboard. The phone is highly customizable, and with the right apps you can create your own ringtones from just about any song or clip.. 
Cons:. If more than one app is running, phone is VERY slow to respond. Handles multitasking poorly. Clumsy interface once on a call. Very underpowered.. Should not have been a smart phone.. 
Summary:. Despite what I read, I was head over heels in love with this phone when I bought it. Since then, I have watched it get easily bogged down with the simplest of tasks. Just moments ago I could not access the camera, and the screen was virtually frozen until I ran the task killer. AT&#38;T did well to introduce us to the Android system, but should have brought in higher end phones. Maybe things will get better when/if the software is updated.. As it stands, it can barely run a single app. If you try to run two, the phone slows down. Personally, I am going to switch to Verizon and get the Droid X. The Android platform is awesome, but like a kid, it needs room to play!. 

$$;
Pros:. camera,access to facebook, widgets, and the app market. 
Cons:. terrible for surfing internet, extremely lagging, even with wi fi on. Battery life is terrible, and doesn't like to download picture messages.. 
Summary:. When i first got this phone i was excited to have the new "droid" for att. I should have known there were going to be problems when i tried setting up the motoblur account and the phone kept showing an error message. I have never had a phone that was so slow to surf the internet. Motorola definitely needs to come up with updates to work the bugs out. If you are debating between this and the iphone, stick with the iphone, i've had both.. 

$$;
Pros:. Physical keyboard, back trackpad, 3G on at&#38;t, 3.5 mm sound jack, nice camera with a flash. 
Cons:. lack of a google search widget on a google android device, android 1.5 which is outdated, no google navigation, poor battery life (fixable with an update to android 2.1). 
Summary:. The phone has a great feel. Large keyboard that is not that awkward to use as it may seem if you have not held a phone. Very nice concept. However, lack of transparency and at&#38;t's lockdown of the phone made me return the phone before the 30-day trial was over. I am still hoping to be able to get it again if and when it upgrades to android 2.1 and gets its restrictions removed.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice keyboard, like that the phone opens instead of slides. 
Cons:. the keyboard is on the outside. this was a stupid idea. dirt and water can easily destroy this phone.. 
Summary:. at&#38;t needs to start getting a hold of phones like Verizon has. the are one of the top cell phone companies, why do they not have the top phones? the iphone is legit, but Verizon has such a better selection.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the keyboard. Screen is decent too but a bit small. Camera is OK.. 
Cons:. Uses out-dated android 1.5 for which many apps are not compatible with, including bluetooth tethering. Motorola initially promised an upgrade to 2.1 but they have since changed the tune saying "Will remain on Android 1.5...." see below. 
Summary:. "Will remain on Android 1.5 for the best combined hardware and software experience." This is on their official site now for Asia-Pacific.. https://supportforums.motorola.com/community/manager/softwareupgrades. What the heck is that supposed to mean? I bought this phone cos I loved the keyboard, and they promised a later upgrade to 2.1. I never thought that that promise would turn into one big fat lie. Shame on you motorola. I will never buy another phone from you as you have demonstrated a lack of accountability and total disregard for your customers needs. You have obviously decided to move on and concentrate on marketing new phones rather than dedicate your efforts to deliver on a promise. Tsk tsk.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3 keyboards are nice, fits in pocket. 
Cons:. Very low batt life, constant disconnect, system reboot needed daily, touch screen hardly works, too much to list!. 
Summary:. I think they had a great concept, just that it needs a better system to operate. Plus comes pre-loaded with many apps that you will never use and they take up alot of memory.. 

$$;
Pros:. MOTOBLUR is a great Idea, backtrack is cool, great keayboard. 
Cons:. Very Slow in Comp to my iPhone 2g, 1.5 (Cupcake) is "soft", Serious Bug issues, decidedly worse than the Devour. 
Summary:. I was eligible for upgrade from my iPhone 2g 4gb. I got my Moto BackFlip on a Wednesday and was ready to take it back on Friday. I only got it because it was free for me. I cant say I regret it bc I told myself that it was just for trial. A trial the backflip failed. I am to the point that I often want to throw my iPhone byut I gladly crawled back to it after two days of using the slow, inefficient, buggy Backflip.. it WONT: Fetch my email, remember to lock my screen, remember my passcode, do anything with expedience.... In one day it "fogot" that I had screen lock on TWICE and I had to reboot the phone for teh lock to activate. It uses battery very rapidly. It just stopped opening Tweetcaster after only having it installed 22 hours. I honestly dont understand how they could have released this and nott somthing mor comparable to the Devour which, IMO, is a MUCH better dvice.. I sent it back today and will be using my ragged iPhone 2g until I feel like picking up a Captivate of 3gs (of MAYBE a Bold).. 

$$;
Pros:. Apps are ok.......... 
Cons:. Phone's antenna is VERY weak and calls are missed or dropped.. 
Summary:. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I "upgraded" from a Blackberry Curve which would have gotten reception at the bottom of a coal mine, and sacrificed major reception. I am returning my 2nd backflip in as many weeks and probably going to a proven product like an I-phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. it's compact, when it works it works well, i read news articles, listen to music, watch videos, check email, update social sites fairly easily. oh yeah and make phone calls and send texts on customizable screens.. 
Cons:. hit the end call button..it wont end.batterylife is non-existent.trying to make a quick call can be a headache.i lost my contacts twice,had to reset.charger is in the way.rarely use the back flip keyboard.lately i'm having issues with the home button. 
Summary:. i want to like it but it's gives me headaches. if you don't want headaches get a different phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Vibrant screen, the cool design and how it can sit in table top position.. 
Cons:. The Backflip is almost impossible to type on. The keys may look large but they are not defined enough and take quite a press when typing. The lighting behind the keys make the keys look faded and worn. The touch screen also seamed unresponsive. .. 
Summary:. Well, if the keyboard is almost useless, it makes the phone pretty useless, unless you just want to talk on it and what would be the point in buying a smartphone just for voice. I was so excited about getting this phone and now I can't wait to return it. I have narrowed it down to either the LG Arena which has great reviews and also does not come with the large data fee, but is full touch screen (something I am not sure I could get used to), or the Blackberry Bold 9700 with a physical qwerty keyboard and large data fee. I currently have a BlackBerry and wanted to go for something a little more fun but no can do the backflip. Anyone have an LG Arena?. 

$$;
Pros:. The price is normal for this type of smartphones. Keyboard is large, but it has its issues: it feels cheap and rubbery.. 
Cons:. This not what a normal Android phone feels like.. 
Summary:. Screen is little small, and the text is a bit too small to read long paragraphs (I think they did that to fit more text on the screen). Touch responsiveness can be sluggish sometimes, and that track pad on the back is pretty useless and hard to reach when holding the phone in normal position. I can't believe that AT&#38;T would lock the phone up, is it something they did for Apple?? Replacing Google's search with Yahoo makes no sense unless they got some deal with Yahoo. Also there are many of AT&#38;T crappy programs that you can't uninstall which reminds me of those little AT&#38;T programs on their cheap budget phones.. I'm returning this "thing" tomorrow.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have not found any. 
Cons:. All the cons have been detailed I have experienced every problem described and then some.. 
Summary:. I am on my third handset in less than 8 months. Each replacement brought a new disappointment.. The first dropped calls incessantly, the second worked fine for about 4 months then began ringing for no apparent reason and could only be stopped by removing the battery. With the third handset, I can clearly hear the caller, but regardless of where I am, the callers cannot hear me. I am totally disgusted with this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Overall design and call quaility is great.. 
Cons:. Phone freezes frequently when recieving calls (won't pick up), frequently will not connect regardless of 3G network and 5 bar signal strength. Motoblur only good for those addicted to twitter/facebook. Must create motoblur account to use phone.. 
Summary:. This is the 2nd backflip I have had as the first was replaced as defective. The current phone has the same problem. resetting the software caused the phone to utilize 225 MB of data while on standby over 3 days. Frequently misses incoming calls as the software freezes when trying to answer. additionally the phone freezes and can only be reset by taking out the battery for a few minutes and rebooting the system. the battery life is horrible, my first backflip only held a charge for around 5 hours (on standby) if used, the battery was drained within 2-3 hours, leaving the phone hot to the touch after 5 minutes useage or while charging.. 

$$;
Pros:. NOTHING! Worthless.. 
Cons:. EVERYTHING, sorry I purchased it.. 
Summary:. Would not recommend this to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. The key pad..... 
Cons:. Would shut down while sending a text. Would have to shut it off and turn back on in order to receive a text.... 
Summary:. The phone broke on day 40 of having this phone. When I called AT&#38;T they were of no help.. Phone shuts off for no reason, would had missed calls and texts. Not a good phone at all. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. i like almost everything about the phone ,the phone operating system is great, and can and in my opinion surpassed that of the iphone ,i own an iphone i have been using iphones from the beginning , the android is better. 
Cons:. in one word the battery.i own more than one phone , i leave the flip phone at home fully charged when i come back home it is completely empty ,even though locked in my desk un used for nine hours it suppose to hold charge for thirteen days .. 
Summary:. it is great phone it can replace my iphone i dont miss my iphone when i am using this one,but battery problem need to be addressed.. 

$$;
Pros:. The apps are great! I liked the design.. 
Cons:. There is no stop button to stop apps from running. You have no idea what is running in the back. The battery would last on average maybe 1hr depending on what you were doing.. 
Summary:. I was really excited to get this phone I did my research before buying it and all the reviews were good. Unfortunately I must have got the test phone because everything that could go wrong with this phone did and all in under 1 week. It sounded like I was muffled when on the phone. It would randomly start playing media and with no way to stop it had to turn phone off. Started hanging up on calls and calling people randomly. Overall it was a bad experience I was really disappointed hopefully they iron out all the kinks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Led camera, interesting flip functionality. 
Cons:. AT&#38;T locked this phone down. It is the only android phone that does not allow web installs. It comes bloated with uninstallable AT&#38;T software.. 
Summary:. Bottom line summary is that I've lost complete faith in cnet reviews because of this one review. 3 1/2 stars for what every respectable gadget blog has called the worst Android phone to ever hit the market. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this *terrible* phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. lots of fun downloadable APPs.. easy to update on social networks.. 
Cons:. Been glichy since i took it out of the box, after 5-10 mins of use the screen goes pixialated, has to be turned off and on to fix it, but does it again soon after.. Battery life sucks, have to charge it every 3-5 hours.. 
Summary:. Wouldnt reccomend this phone to anyone. Android market for Apps doesnt have any fail, but the phone its self has far to many.. the key pad being on the back of the phone (when not folded out) is a desing flaw, I've had mine 6months and the keypad is scrated and warn.. The battery life is only 3 hours being used or not the battery drains itself.. Also, now when i use it i notice that the plate on the back of the phone (where the battery is) has loosened itself, ive tried taking it off and putting back on, but that doesnt help, it creeks like a loose floor board.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not a whole lot. The camera takes ok pics, depending on if the flash works. idea of the qwerty keyboard, idea of linking contacts to facebook, myspace etc.. 
Cons:. new batt every 3mos, slow, freezes ALL the time, setting up motoblur and linking ALL contacts is a pain in the butt and takes forever. Couldn't open contacts resulted in a phone reset and lost ALL linked contacts. Have to force close stuff ALOT!. 
Summary:. I have been with AT&#38;T for a solid 3 years straight, and about another 2 years prior. But i am very unhappy with them. The phone i had before this one was a P.O.S. i had about 6 or 7 handsets and 3 batteries. Came time to upgrade, never used a "smartphone" before but i knew a good bit about them. I am NOT a fan of the iphone. So, I figured this phone being the first android on the at&#38;t network would be the best choice for me. Boy, was i wrong!. Out of the box i had a problem. I fully charged it like you are supposed to, about 4 hrs later it was dead. Had to take it back the next day. This phone gives you the ability to link all your contacts to their myspace or facebook which takes FORVER! I spent like an hr doing this if not longer. Goodluck if the phone has a "myspace or facebook connection error" all the linking is gone. This happened to me 2x and once all the pictures disappeared. Only way to get pictures back was to delete fb/ms accounts and then re-sync them. I also had problem with being able to view my contacts. When i would click on a contact i would get an error msg and it would force close. So after a week i had to call at&#38;t and they made me do a master reset the on phone. Lost all the contacts i had linked up for the like 4th time not to mention apps. I gave up on the linking, So what's the motoblur for now?? Phone freezes... doing anything, receiving phone calls, surfing the web, browsing the happenings widget, texting, etc, When texting is full it will freeze, act really weird then delete all text and takes about a min before you can send a text . Extremely annoying and frustrating! A text app fixed this problem for me up until the master reset, i just haven't felt like re-downloading loading all of my apps because i don't think the phone is worth it anymore.. You can only use at&#38;t nav which is $10/mo and search is locked to yahoo.. I got this phone when it first came out and i am now on the 4th battery and foresee another battery or handset in the near future. At&#38;t refusing to do anything about it. Basically i am having the same problem as the last phone. Is this a trend AT&#38;T??. If your looking for a touch screen phone that only works when it wants to and don;t mind replacing the battery every 3mos then this phone is for you. If you don't want these frustrating problems stay far far away, even tho the phone is FREE now!?. Once the other line on my account is out of contract, i AM saying GOODBYE to at&#38;t and HELLO to big red.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not a whole lot The screen is nice and the pictures. 
Cons:. Keeps shutting off for no reason. Takes for ever to get back on. Bluettooth does not work right, Screen shifts Does not let you know if you missed a call unless you turmn it off first.Battery does not stay charged long. Must charge ever day.. 
Summary:. I guess i just need a phone to call and text. Can not make capital letters unless you put period at the end of a word. It just get frustrating whne you are talking and phone just shuts off. Then it takes about two minutes to warm up. Wish I never bought it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the screen &#38; the camera is good.. 
Cons:. Almost everything ... screen freezes, shuts off on its own, dials people in call history without touching anything.. 
Summary:. I would suggest looking into other phones. I am on my 3rd backflip b/c ATT wont do sh*t about THEIR phone. I wouldnt recommend this phone to ANYONE.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good camera. 
Cons:. Lags on forever, I can't even text my friends back because every time I try to, a message pops up on my screen that says, "sorry!" and i have to force close and it takes me back to the home screen!, I have to charge it twice a day, can only call now. 
Summary:. This phone is useless!!! A waste of money! I'm currently visiting family right now and got the phone shipped to me. Ever since I attempted to turn it on I've had problems. The only thing it's good for now is calls, even though i have to put it on speaker to hear it.. I was trying to text people one night and got really frusterated with it so i turned it off and took the battery out, hoping it would let me send 1 message and it wouldnt so I turned it off for the rest of the night until I woke up, on the charger, and it still wouldn't work!. If you are thinking about getting this phone, I reccomend looking around more.. When I get back home, I am so returning this! &gt;:(. 

$$;
Pros:. I can't really think of any Pros.. 
Cons:. It kept calling friends on my Facebook. They thought I was a crazy woman.. Hard to type in phone numbers.. Slider bar didn't work well. Hard to navigate. 
Summary:. I returned the phone after almost a week of frustration. When I was in the phone store returning it, another customer made a comment about how she hated that phone, too.. 

$$;
Pros:. led camera. 
Cons:. inability to uninstall at&#38;t's useless applications which takes up memory. inability to change configured at&#38;t applications from yahoo to google. poor customer service. isn't this a google android operating system??. 
Summary:. avoid. best to wait for a better phone - google's nexus one?.
