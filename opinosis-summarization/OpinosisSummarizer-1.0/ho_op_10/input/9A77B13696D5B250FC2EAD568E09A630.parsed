reception/NN staff/NN did/VBD n't/RB quite/RB seem/VB to/TO reach/VB the/DT usual/JJ pi/NN standard/NN :/: on/IN arrival/NN we/PRP were/VBD n't/RB told/VBN of/IN the/DT goodnight/NN guarantee/NN -/: possibly/RB they/PRP knew/VBD i/FW had/VBD been/VBN a/DT regular/JJ visitor/NN in/IN thepast/NN so/RB thought/VBD they/PRP did/VBD n't/RB need/VB to/TO mention/VB it/PRP ./.

breakfast/NN on/IN our/PRP$ first/JJ morning/NN was/VBD chaotic/JJ -/: a/DT large/JJ party/NN went/VBD in/IN at/IN the/DT very/JJ start/NN ,/, by/IN the/DT time/NN we/PRP got/VBD there/EX at/IN 8/CD ./.
