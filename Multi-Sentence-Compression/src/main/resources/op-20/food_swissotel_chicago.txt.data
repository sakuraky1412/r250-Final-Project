Good but pricey food, great breakfast .
In any case, I had allotted approximately $150 for “food” for 4 days 3 nights .
Ed Debevics is fun, , sassy servers, diner food, total check about $30 for all four of us .
Staying with food, try also the Weber Grill, N .
The hotel buffet had fabulous food .
As far as food, walk a few blocks toward Michigan Ave turn left or right and there are plently of less expensive places to eat .
The Italian food was superb .
No line, a plate full of REAL food with drink included for $7 each .
Food unexceptional although the breakfast buffet in the basement restaurant   was of good quality .
A nice restaurant with reasonable prices and great food .
I didn't dine in the hotel, so I can't tell you about the food .
The food for our event was delicious .
Took the charge of the minibar which we had used to keep my 2 year old sons food .
I was delighted as the waiters were very friendly and the seafood was delicious .
mile with traditional Italian food and a great atmosphere .
Room service was efficient, average priced, and decent food .
Very friendly servers and nice selection of food at a reasonable price .
An added bonus was the Executive Lounge with complimentary food throughout the day .
We never ate anything onsite so I can't vouch for the food options immediately avialable .
Very much enjoyed the Chicago Food Tour, a walking tour that incorporates food tastings at various places like a bakery, traditional deli, pizza, chocolate lounge, etc .
