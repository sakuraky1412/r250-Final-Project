$$;
Pros:. Nikor 5x wide optical zoom, 12.0 Million pixels (12 Megapixels), 16 photo modes, 30 fps video recordin, sound recording, macro etc.. 
Cons:. doesnt work very well in low light areas. 
Summary:. if you actually know how to use a camera PROPERLY then this camera is very good check out my picture on flickr but check that the pictures have been taken by ^Nikon S570^ on properties because i started off with a bad camera click this link and comment on my pics http://www.flickr.com/photos/funny_monkey/. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, very adjustable, Small but powerful, It's a Nikon.. 
Cons:. I've had the camera 5 months now and I don't have a bad thing to say about it yet.. 
Summary:. If your looking for an easy to use pocket camera that performs like a big camera this is the one for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great size, great picture quality. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I've owned this camera for 2 months, and have taken 1200 pictures with it in that time. I don't know about some of the other reviews talking about the camera being "slow" and putting out "blurry pictures" I think it was probably operator error. I find this camera to be mechanically sound and the shots are colorful and sharp. This is a great snapshot/landscape camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. i love the sleek and slimness of the cam. i lovwe how it makes still portraits look. altough it has electronic IS, it still works as well as optical IS. i love that it has a rechargeable battery also. i see me having this camera for a few mor years.. 
Cons:. there is not many cons i can think of if there is one its the low light pic quality but i still love this camera i can only expect so much from a $150 compact camera. yes i got it for $150 at Sam's Club! great deal. 
Summary:. it is a great camera for beginners and still has the performance to satisfy a person quite into photography. and it fits anyones budget. plus nikon is an elite camera brand!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, doesn't take up much space, good battery life &#38; takes sharp photos. Also a pretty sturdy camera - I dropped it once and it sustained no damage, thanks to the metal case I imagine.. 
Cons:. There is about a 2 second lag time between pictures, maybe a little longer if using the flash. Also, the zoom control takes some time to master.. 
Summary:. I bought mine on Amazon for $125 and think it's a great value. I've taken pix in light and dark conditions and have had nothing but crisp results. I was surprised to see so many people complaining about blurry pix because every shot I've taken has been crisp. It's also very easy to get the pix out of the camera and into the PC. Very pleased.. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture quality, vibrant colors, easy to use presets, Party Mode and Food Mode are my favorites.. 
Cons:. high ISO sucks, no easy access to manual mode or settings, orientation sensor is sporadic. 
Summary:. This camera has been good to me. It's easy to use and perfect for carrying in your pockets for outings, parties, vacations, etc. Obviously not as awesome as a DSLR but awesome if you are looking for a don't-have-to-think point and shoot.. 

$$;
Pros:. ~ Price. ~ 12.1 MP is a good resolution.. ~ Picture comes in really good where there is a lot light.. ~ Smart portrait is a nice feature which detects smile. ~ Scene selection is also a nice feature.. ~ Compatible with SD and SDHC memory cards.. 
Cons:. ~ If light is less then it uses the flash in auto mode even when it is outdoors so picture is not so good if you are taking a scene. ~ In the play mode, it takes a time to resolve the picture, os if u just skim through u may think that its bad!. 
Summary:. I like this product because it is compact, easy to carry and because of the easy features and less number of buttons, it makes life really easy for people who are not so used to digital cameras. The price I got it at is also really very good. I got it for $150 during Thanksgiving and must say that it was a good bargain. The other plus is that it is compatible with SD and SDHC memory cards which are inexpensive compared the Sony Pro Duo sticks which most sony cameras use.. 

$$;
Pros:. 12 megapixels, 3200 ISO, 2.7" LCD, Small, Compact, Light. Has many settings that can help you in almost every situation.. 
Cons:. Well it's NOT a DSLR, so why complain about speed? Other reviews I've read complain thats its slow. Most compact point and shoot cameras are slow. Want a fast shooting camera look at the Nikon D90 or the Nikon D5000.. 
Summary:. Learn how to use a camera. Every camera can be even better if you read the manual. This one is basic enough for the new consumer, but if you want the best pictures from your camera, read the manual. Bottom Line!. In my eyes, I wouldn't go with any other brand name, other than Nikon. Great cameras, had a few, but always enjoy upgrades. Just buy it. Peace!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality, especially at 80 ISO, simple operation.. 
Cons:. Limited feature set.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera because I wanted something smaller and lighter than my Finepix F200EXR, which is a very good camera. I took a few shots and at the lowest ISO settings, picture quality actually seemed better on the S570. Very nice little camera, especially for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. big view screen, easy to use, multiple features, size, speed of recovery between pictures, fast shutter for action shots. 
Cons:. most pics taken recently in tropics seemed too bright and washed out. settings used were all automatic so camera chose exposure/brigntness. 
Summary:. I have 3 dig cameras. A old nikon coolpix (about 10 years old) olympus with 10x optical zoom and now this one. Each has a specific role. I got this one because I wanted a compact camera to take on vacations that took pictures quickly so I could get good action shots. I am very happy with it's size, viewing screen size and easy to use features. I thought the speed in taking action shots (shutter speed?) was fine despite reviews that said it was somewhat slow. The only negative so far is that my pictures taken in bright tropical sun seem slightly washed out (overexposed?) and I was using the auto feature so the camera made the decisions about shutter speed/exposure etc. Overall, I am very happy and would buy this camera again, and recomment to a friend. Oh, battery life seems really good too.. 

$$;
Pros:. It takes a very sharp picture and has gobs of features to make it easy to take them under a variety of conditions.. 
Cons:. It takes several seconds to record to the SD card.. 
Summary:. Like most point and shoot digital cameras, you have to read the manual to get the most out of it. Lower light shots aren't "blurred" they are noisy with the default settings. I find by locking the ISO down to 80-400 for most uses produces very sharp images indoors and on cloudy days. Speaking of the flash, I continue to be amazed at the width and intensity for such a small thing. I have one subjective complaint: With my fairly large hands, I find this camera a bit too compact and I find it hard to keep my fingers out of each others way and off of the controls.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact and User friendly features for a amateur with good enough specifications.. 
Cons:. I m feeling cheated as I got it two days back at Seoul Airport Duty Free for $ 197/- and found on review only $147/- or so. Should have been priced closer to online pricing, not to have customers a feeling that they got cheated.. 
Summary:. Yet to compare the quality and over all experience against my other cameras, Panasonic ( Lumix), Olympus, KODAK and Yashika. After a detail look and price on C-Net review, feeling that could have gone for a more recent version.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lovely for taking portraits and stills of people, as it softens thier faces, and leaves the eyes sharp enough to appreciate it. Not as sharp and clear as I would prefer, but the nice faces makes up for it.. 
Cons:. On a cloudy day or indoors with out flash (as I prefer for my pet photos) it is IMPOSSIBLE to take a photo that is NOT blurry. I sent it back. It does not work for me at all!. 
Summary:. If you are taking stills of people and wish to have a softened "romantic mood" pic in good lighting (outdoors) or with flash, this is a good camera. Even when printed in larger sizes. If you need action shots (a horse show, football game, running children) forget it. If you want indoor pics or pics on an overcast day forget it, you are getting any that are not blurred.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good for outdoor shots, pictures of still subjects in decent lighting.. 
Cons:. Usless for moving subjects, shutter lag is terrible.. 
Summary:. I got this camera as a birthday present, and was pretty excited since my last one had been broken a few months back. I took some outdoor shots and it worked wonderfully -- however, shots of a moving subject indoors is a different matter. If you want to take a moving picture of something like fish in an aquarium, unless you've put flash on, forget about it. Well, the flash creates a flare on the glass of the tank anyway, so that's still no good.. Also, there's no way to adjust the shutter speed. Thanks, Nikon.. Updated. on Sep 18, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Small size 5x optical zoom. 
Cons:. poor auto focus. Extremely slow, poor overall pictures. 
Summary:. I bought this for my wife to take on a trip. I was seduced by the 12 mega pixels, 5x zoom and price. The problem was that my three year old Canon 6mp S600 takes much better pictures and is 3 times as fast between shots. I'm taking this one back and getting another Canon.. 

$$;
Pros:. I honestly can't think of any pro's. 
Cons:. pic's are awful, It is a nightmare trying to figure out how to use it. you think you have the settings right, and you take a good pic. Then the next pic you take looks like crap.. 
Summary:. I am an amateur photographer. I only take photo's of family events and stuff like that. I have a canon DSLR and my wife has trouble using it, so I wanted to get her a good quality camera she could use. I bought this camera for my wife for christmas 2009. After taking 10 pictures, I knew I was taking this thing back. She would take a picture and then try to review the pic, but the pic would not be there. It would say "image not available" Alot of pic's would do that so when you reviewed your pic's their would be a lot of blanks. Plus the pic's where poor quality. I think that if you read a review that say's the quality is good, I would say that person has come from an old 3-5 mega pixel camera, so in that case they did upgrade. I did trade the nikon for a (canon powershot SD780 IS) and I have to say so far the canon is awsome and very very easy to use. It records video in HD, and the quality is very good even in low light... I hope this has helped you and if you buy the Nikon you will see what I mean... 

$$;
Pros:. Small light camera, easy to handle and figure out in 10 seconds. 
Cons:. takes horrible blurry shots of anything thats moving..If you can get your favorite artist to stop on stage and pose fo a good 5 seconds, it would work..otherwise..useless!. 
Summary:. I previosuly had a cannon powershot which was borrowed from me and lost. I have a Nikon SLR that I love so I decided to give their point&#38;shoot a trial..BAD idea! I tested it at home and thought it was fine..took it it out to a concert and regretted it all night...almost imcapable of taking sharp stills of anything moving, so shots of my fave band that my cannon previously handled beautifully, this camera was completely incapable of handling. Every one in ten shots was descent and the rest were blurry and frustrating. Heading to the store to return it this morning...big blah on this one! Only reason I even give it 2 stars is for its size and weight but performace could not stink more!. 

$$;
Pros:. in video mode its performance is very good. 
Cons:. but within 8 months of purchase its stopped functioning showing lens error . this is not expected from a mfg like nikon. 

$$;
Pros:. Size - video. 
Cons:. The on/off switch fell down in the camera 6 wks from purchase. After repair, it happened again! I also have trouble getting good pics in low light and have trouble trying to figure out the best setting to use.. 
Summary:. I will not buy a Nikon again and will never buy a camera from our local camera shop! I was so very disappointed in this camera and in the service I have received. Owning it 6 months and it has been in the shop 8 weeks is not what I would call good quality!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a compact digital camera that has the capability of taking good upclose shots.. 
Cons:. Everytime I think i have pics saved to my card &#38; I delete one pic i end up with no pictures. It reads no images on file.Im frustrated b/c when review the pic the next I see is they're eraced. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Is it the camera?. 
Summary:. It's not keeping my photos on the camera or memory card.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact , nice design. 
Cons:. Poor image quality, very slow performance - don't buy it !. 
Summary:. This is the last time i'm buying a Nikon camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought it because of zoom capabilities. 
Cons:. Haven't been able to get it to work to take a non-blurry photo. 
Summary:. I have had a terrible time with this camera and with customer service. I've tried changing every setting and restoring to factory settings. I've tried in every type of light and with people sitting still. Doesn't matter what I do, getting a picture that is anywhere close to clear is nearly impossible. My husband took it on a trip and it completely quit working for a while and you could only see white screen. Very frustrating. I've got an e-mail out to nikon, but I'm not expecting much in terms of a reply.. I'm guessing we'll end up having to purchase a different camera and just junking this one. (Seriously, I can't even give it to one of my kids to play with because it is that bad...). Save your money and find something else that really works!. 

$$;
Pros:. No pros to this camera. 
Cons:. Blurry pics!!!!. 
Summary:. I bought a cheap Kodak camera for my daughter on Black Friday and I decided to buy this more expensive camera for myself, thinking it would be a better camera. My daughters camera takes EXCELLENT photos and mine are very very blurry. I have adjusted all of the settings and this does not help. I WOULD NOT recommend this camera. 

$$;
Pros:. Very lightweight. 
Cons:. Shutter delay, very hard to get a decent picture. 
Summary:. I was SO disappointed in this camera. On the default settings we took some random pics both inside and outside, and not one of them were good quality - they were all blurry, dark and faded looking. We messed with the settings for over an hour and tried again and I'd say maybe 80% of the pics were still very poor quality. We'll be returning it to Best Buy despite the 15% restocking fee.. 

$$;
Pros:. the wide angle lens, the 5x zoom, the... wait, that's it. 
Cons:. Image quality is poor, at best, in less then perfect conditions. The video quality is horrible. The lag time between shots is terrible. The price, $200, is way to much to pay for this camera (I would say at around $75-100, it could be worth it.. 
Summary:. This camera makes me regret ever giving Nikon a chance. I have had several Canons in my time, and I've tried others like Casio, Kodak, Sony, and none came close, but I thought for sure Nikon would prove to me that Canon wasn't the only one actually playing the point and shoot field. I was wrong. I shot a few videos when I went snowboarding, they came out unwatchable (the colors, the quality, the exposure, everything). Images I took of during the day of the mountains at full zoom (optical only, never use digital zoom) came out unprintable (they look as if it was full digital and I know it was only optical zoom). If you want to take a picture of friends, but one of them blinks, you might want to buy them a round so they don't get mad waiting for the camera to reset so you can take another photo. The place that I bought it from said I was a day late on their return policy, so they said I need to talk to Nikon directly about getting a refund, and Nikon's response was that they didn't sell it to me directly so they're not responsible (even thought the power button cap fell of in two days after I bought it and the screen started getting all messed up from the inside within a couple of days). The CNet expert reviews make me think twice about their testing methods and their integrity.. 

$$;
Pros:. pocket sized, good brand name. 
Cons:. blurry pictures, very long shutter lag, yellow pictures, the focus takes way too long and you miss your photo opportunity. All of this despite, using or not using flash, inside versus outsides, and waiting up to 10 seconds for it to focus. 
Summary:. Don't do it! Terrible! Worst camera I have ever owned and NO it's not due to operating error. I'm an amateur photographer and have many years experience with various cameras including the oh-so-simple point and shoots. Nikon screwed up on this one. And, yes I've read the manual inside and out, I've even taken it in to get looked at, it's just a badly made camera. The shutter is absolutely terrible. You have to hold the shutter button half way, wait for it to focus and beep, which can literally take up to 10 seconds! 10 seconds, really Nikon?? Then, take the picture after it has focused. I know it's not an SLR, but Nikon could have done much better with this point and shoot. And, it doesn't change depending on the mode you're in. So, if you have kids, or want to take ANY moving/quick snap picture, DON'T do this camera. You'll regret it. Get one with a much faster shutter. Also, the picture quality is blurry and the color can be yellow. This happens no matter the setting (outside/inside, flash/no flash, whatever mode you're in, and after waiting for it to focus for those disturbing 10 seconds). All around, it's this camera that turned me into a Canon fan. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact and inexpensive.. 
Cons:. Extremely soft focus. Auto-focus in macro mode goes right past focal point and stops on "blur". Very slow start up and and shot to to shot times. Poor color replication.. 
Summary:. I have used and loved Nikon cameras for over 30 years, I currently have a total of 7 Nikon's including the s570. I love them all, except, for the s570. The soft pictures, the poor auto-focus, the lousy controls, the really slow start up and shot to shot times are just the the nails in the coffin this baby needs. Get a Canon... I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. not much to like. 
Cons:. need to be an astronaut to operate it. 
Summary:. way, way too complex, and instruction book almost unreadable. 

$$;
Pros:. Outside in bright light it takes good pictures, and it's a comfortable size to carry. 
Cons:. Within a week, the integral sliding lens cover quit working, and the flash hasn't worked for 3 months. Picture quality indoors isn't what I'd anticipated - tend to be grainy, fuzzy, and the color rarely seems true.. 
Summary:. I won't buy another Nikon camera.. 

$$;
Pros:. Takes nice portrait photos outside on a nice day.. 
Cons:. At night or if it's a cloudy day most of the photos come out very blurry even when the settings are changed, I am going to try to exchange mine for another camera and will be using my very old Olympus in the meantime :o(.
