Pros:. Fast, lean, practical layout, with none of the redundancies and visual fluff of XP. This OS is faster than XP and Vista for speed if your PC's processor is under 1G and and easier to navigate . I've been using it since 3/02.. 
Cons:. There is nothing I don't like about it, especially after having tried the cartoony Windows XP. I do wish it had the number of games Windows 98 Plus came with, but oh well.... 
Summary:. Some people say the boot time is slow. This entirely depends on the number and type of applications you have starting at boot-up. Turn your messengers and spoyware programs on manually, once you have entered Windows. (I also suggest the use of a file eraser to keep your PC fast). My boot-up time is about 60 seconds.. For stability and speed, this OS blows away both Windows 98 and XP. It is particularly good if you refuse to give up your PIII. Do I want to go out and spend a grand on a new tower that is capable of handling Windows 7? Heck, no. Don't believe the hype. With Windows 2000, you get what you need, without all the junk you don't.. It will not accept IE7, but with Firefox, who needs IE7. (IE6 is still my main browser). With a broadband internet connection, a file eraser and registry tool, as well as frequent defragmentation, my Windows 2000 system is much faster than a lot of my friends' XP and Vista systems. Admittedly, this has a lot to do with configuration, but I guess my ultimate point, here, is that for the casual surfer and word processer, there is a lot being offered, these days, that you just do not need. I run it on a 600Mhz processor with 640 RAM and a 15G harddrive and I couldn't be happier. I read the horror stories about other, newer systems and just cruise on by.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clean running with out being invasive and tweakable.. 
Cons:. They no longer support it.. 
Summary:. Microsoft should consider how much their users prefer this system when creating Windows 7.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stable, Fast, Reliable. 
Cons:. Slower Startup Less Harware drivers. 
Summary:. For me it now Windows 2000 Professional now plays a utilitarian roll on my home net work. (Internet connection sharing, file storage/retrival computers..ect.) It is by me trusted due to it's stability and speed and ease of use. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely stable, fast, secure. 
Cons:. Boot time could be better, but I hardly reboot anyway.. 
Summary:. I couldn't say enough. Of all the Microsoft bashing people must have ignored Windows NT completely. More stable than Windows XP will ever be, I have found Windows 2000 Pro to be a truly dedicated OS that will run contemporary software, most games (despite it's business-class) and will allow you to compute with confidence.. With it's intuitive Win9x interface, it looks ready to go without being daunting, yet it is not Win9x by a long stretch. Based entirely on 32 bit Windows NT, Microsoft squeezed every little hint of DOS out of this OS, and it was such as good OS, that they based the Windows XP Operating System on it.. The Uptime is easily server-like and reboot is only necessary when you configure a new device, make a big registry change or hack the hack in MSConfig. What I said in my summary? Ignore the folklore about MS instability. The only thing I would recommend before connecting to the Internet is to turn off the Windows Messenger Service, either in the Services applet or via this website: http://www.grc.com/stm/shootthemessenger.htm. Other than that, Windows 2000 sets the ultimate goal in stability, security, usability, and proven dedication. Well done, MS!. 

$$;
Pros:. Really to use networking options. Really easy to setup. Easier to setup and run programs then windows 98.. 
Cons:. Slow startup.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stable, user friendly, great for home and office.. 
Cons:. It takes a bit longer to boot than others.. 

$$;
Summary:. Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional is the best Microsoft OS to date. It does run a little slow and takes up more room then Microsoft NT Workstation 4.0 on a Pentium II 200 MHz, but that is to be expected since NT 4 is from 1996 and W2K is from 2000! Anyways I recommened this to any NT 4 user that has a 150 MHz Pentium with 64 megs of RAM!. 

$$;
Summary:. I recently upgrade my PC from win98se to win2000Pro . Soo far i think its the best, coz i try winXPpro it didnt give me good result plus it take a long time to upgrade... Although i must admit its kinda slow in booting time but usualy i dont boot, i just hybernate my pc.... 

$$;
Summary:. I built a computer about a year ago, and installed the full version of Win2000 Pro. My system has never crashed once. I've had programs lock, but all I had to do was hit the windows key on the keyboard to get back to windows...the system has never locked, honost! Although, I've heard it's not for gamers, I have 27 different games installed of different types...all run great, even the old ones. Some software makers recommend Windows 2000 Pro over Windows XP Pro. I would recommend it to anyone who has a good understanding of computers (It does require more knowledge of computers and operating systems than win 95/98/WinME).. 

$$;
Summary:. Intuitive interface, stable performance, what else can I say? So much better than 98, delivers what XP promises..... 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using Windows 2000 Professional at home for about 4 months now and I have NEVER gotten a BSOD or hard crash. Also I can protect my files and folders with Win2k's security features and NTFS. These are degrees of security and stability that no Win9x or ME user will ever experience. I highly recommend this OS to businesses and home users.. 

$$;
Summary:. This OS is the best out there! all of my programs run so nicely on it-solidworks, adobe premiere, photoshop, and all my games run so perfect on it. There is nothing wrong with it, though, I like the look of Xp, but i can give up look for quality. 

$$;
Summary:. Device drivers can be found at http://www.driversguide.com for any machine.. 

$$;
Summary:. I used to have Windows ME and it almost destroyed my computer and my sanity. But eversince I changed to Win2K, my sanity is back and my notebook works fine. It is more friendly than I expected. I use Celeron processor, yet Win2K seems to work just fine. If you are frustrated with 98SE and/or ME then change your OS to Win2K.. 

$$;
Summary:. I don't like Most M$ products, but I do have to admit that this is by far bettter than 95-XP! It's familiar and it's stable. Also, Diablo II and EverQuest work well with it. I like how it's a M$ based OS that actually uses ALL your RAM and speeds the performance of everything up! I have to give credit where it's due, Windows 2000 actually made me happy.. 

$$;
Summary:. I will never go back to a 9x after using this OS. Best OS microsoft has written to date even compared against XP Pro. 

$$;
Summary:. If you want an operating system that is flexible, reliable, and can do all you want....here it is. I found that it can also run many games! Don't mess with Windows XP. 2000 Pro is the way to go.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows 2000 is awesome. Its really fast, and runs smoothly. Once it boots, it runs faster then 98/ME. Even more stable then Windows NT 4. UPGRADE!!! ITS WORTH IT!!. 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using Windows since Win95, the main problems were stability, now, with 2000, i haven't encountered even one crash, i've been using it for 6 months now, even Win ME has crash problems, LONG LIVE 2000!. 

$$;
Summary:. Best OS ever. Instlled XP and really like it. If you rate XP under 3, I guess you never use it.. 

$$;
Summary:. Best OS.It workes better than Winxp &#38; winMe. don't ruin your time &#38; money with WinXp.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is the best OS so far. I have used all the os from 3.11 to today and this one beats all of them. I have had it for a year adn it crashes far less than any os i have used. Plus its secure. I can keep my stuff private. WHoever said xp is better is full of sh*t.. 

$$;
Summary:. I used every single OS by microsoft from 3.1 and up I haven't used a OS better than NT, I thought, until I installed Windows 2000. I have used it for about 2 years now and it has not crashed once. I used 98 both First edition and Second edition and i almost ended having to buy a new computer. I used ME and couldn't get anything done. I also heard about the New XP and how good it is. But when I installed the professional edition, I couldn't believe how much space it took on my hard drive. 2GB!!!!!, it is a rediculous amount of hard drive space. I also needed 128mb of ram to ran it. Simply outragious. After getting everything set up on XP, now I have to worry about the bugs and cracks all over the place. EVEN AFTER SERVICE PACK 1 Windows 2000 has been the best OS microsoft has ever produced. The OS has none or at least none cracks or bugs I have expericed yet after installing the Service Pack 1 and Service Pack 2. If your computer meets the minimal requirments for Windows 2000. I really suggest the upgrade.. 

$$;
Summary:. XP gave me heartaches and crashes and BSOD! So I went back to Win 2000 (sp3) and I never looked back. This is great OS!. 

$$;
Summary:. I started on computers with DOS...which I loved. I have used Windows 3, 3.11, 95 OSR2, 98, 98SE, Windows ME (forget that one), Windows 2000 Pro, Windows XP (On computers I have worked on.) Windows 2000 Pro is THE operating system for me...it's looks, ease of use, no blue screens...it is stable.. 

$$;
Summary:. I had W2000 for two months and I have yet to experience any crash! This OS is simply fantastic! You gotta have it. You will not regret it.. 

$$;
Summary:. With NT backbone, W2k is the most stable Windows ever, including XP. 2000 has only a few stupid badly-made, useless, full of bugs, features. Unlike 98 everything that went in works. Also, Operation never slows and if it does with an instant alt,ctrl,delete it is easy and fast to quit programs. 

$$;
Summary:. There is nothing like it. I had Windows 98se and Me and they regularly lock-up or freeze for no reason. Windows XP better than 2000? Please... If you own old hardwares and softwares, XP is a nightmare (just read some of the user reviews in Cnet). Win2K may not be flash as XP, but it sure is stable and friendly to good old hardwares and softwares. The some of the problems people have with Win2K can be easily corrected by clean installing and not updating. Win2K is still the Best OS!. 

$$;
Summary:. I can think enough of people who are installing windows XP home or pro edition on their computer ... This is just bad ... I use windows 2000 for gaming and sirf the net and i want the best possible optimized performance for my computer ... So i use win 2000 . Forgot about Me , dont talk to me about XP if you dont want to upgrade , choose win 2000 . Or , stick with 98.... 

$$;
Summary:. A good Stability , quick and also vrey complaint with the most aplications , software and drivers !! A Must to have !!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. I use my pc for gaming, multimedia and surfing. My first OS was 95, good at it's time. Win98 was a BIG improvement over it. Stable and easier. I've used 98 for three years. Then came WinMe (The Dreaded). I formated my pc to install Me. After that I had to format every three months or so. It was a HUGE DISAPOINTMENT. Totally worth less cause most of games ran very slow on that OS. My friend recommended win2k for me and i tried it out. Sure i had to upgrade my drivers, but it was amazing! Interface is as smooth as Me but whole lot faster and stable. NEVER crashed! All my newer games plays faster on win2000. I love it. Also good choice for families where kids also use pc, and you're afraid they might kill your pc. Profile managment is as good as winNt. NOTE: Some older games may not run on win2k! So dual booting in win98 is an option.. 

$$;
Summary:. I love this OS. I used to run Windows 98 and was afraid to upgrade because of poor games support. When I finally did, I was impressed at how well it did run games. Sure, I had to spend some time getting some new drivers but that time was well worth it. Two words: Task Manager! I recommend this OS to anyone who wants to fall in love with their computer all over again.. 

$$;
Summary:. I am again and again amazed by Win2K. Over the last three months the system has never had a fatal error, and I as more and more product updates comeout for it, I am able to play all the games I ever wanted. About the only problem that I really have with it is the fact that it takes a minute to boot, and only a minute. From what I have been reading about XP I will not upgrade. Win 2K is where I am staying...for now.. 

$$;
Summary:. I was able through work to go to Microsoft's XP training seminar. I think this is their best attempt so far (even though the requirements are a bit hefty- but then again, all the new systems out nowadays should support it). Microsoft overhauled the OS a bit...added CD creation capabilities, DVD through decoder, an Unzipping program built in, customizable desktop, more stability, and much, much more too numerous to mention here. And the very "controversial" activation is nothing spectacular at all. Microsoft been doing it for years and just started it here in the U.S. with Office XP. If you have an internet connection, you're activated in mere seconds, if that long. I say if that's what they have to do to prevent piracy, then so be it. Take it and run with it. According to Microsoft, you can put it on another system, you just have to completely uninstall it from the system it was previously on. Simple as that. I'm impressed by XP and to those of you who obtain it, you'll be too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stable operating system. 
Cons:. Slower at boot-up. 

$$;
Pros:. Very stable, powerful security features, highly flexible, powerful administration tools. A "must have!" for any power user. If you are considering upgrading to XP Pro on your network (or are a single user who doesn't care about the fancy XP features), be. 
Cons:. High price of $319 for full install. Does not have XP "Home user" features (for those who want them).. 

$$;
Summary:. In my opinion definetely the best Windows of them all. I have used Windows 95/98 SE, ME,XP both Home and Professional and Windows 2000 Professional is the best of them. It's stability is impressive (Pretty Much the same as Windows XP, they use the same system 'NFTS') Its speed is awesome except for booting the computer (start) which is kind of slow but not VERY (faster than 98's). It still has the windows classic style which is much more comfortable than the 'new' XP style in my opinion. It takes less space in your disk than XP does. The only 'bad' of it is that it doesnt come with the Windows Media Player that actually IS a player (it comes with the 6.4 version) and other features that come with XP. Don't think that XP's features are that good, for example the new feature in XP called 'Movie Maker' is a joke. XP comes with things that you dont even use. I discovered that after installing both XP and 2000 in different partisions, I entered windows Update and guess what... windows XP has like 35+ 'critical' updates while 2000 has less than 10. XP comes with IE (Internet explorer) 6 while 2000 with IE 5.01. There are almost no difference except for 'screen fit' which sets the picture in the windows size. But if you would like to have that feature you can download it to 2000 but I dont recomend it because you will need to update + more 10-20 critical updates to it! Windows XP vs. windows 2000, 2000 wins easy. Best Windows Ever.... 

$$;
Summary:. I've had windows '98, ME &#38; now for the past 3+ month's i've had the pleasure of using window's 2000. What i'll say is it has surpassed ny expectation's in that, i thought OS's were always buggy &#38; you'd always encounter the odd or maybe obligatory error. Not with this OS!! I've had nothing but plain sailing all the way. Seriously, i've used '98 for year's &#38; was never pleased with the (legendary) blue-screen-of-death. On encountering ME, i found the same operating system as '98, just with bell's &#38; whistle's &#38; now a disturbing sluggish feel to it. So in conclusion, 2000 is the best out there (&#38; don't even get me started on the un-reliable bell &#38; whistle ridden mess that is XP) &#38; if you're looking for a stable, reliable, hassle free OS windows 2000 is your only choice!!. 

$$;
Summary:. I have fewer headaches and glitches with Win 2000 than Win XP. 2000 is stable &#38; fast and thankfully lacks XP's neauseating cartoon interface...My PC had XP preloaded and I went back to Win 2000. 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using Windows 2000 on my home machine for three months now. My only regret is that I didn't install it sooner. When I bought my machine, it came with Windows Me, and I had nothing but trouble with it. I'm still amazed that Microsoft released two different operating systems that present the same interface to the user, but are like night and day when it comes to stability and reliability. After the switch to Windows 2000, I was able to use all the software I had already bought (except for one DOS game) and it all runs better than it ever did under Windows Me. For example, under Windows Me, EasyCD Creator would always underrun its buffer if I tried to burn at speeds faster than 300 KB per second. With Windows 2000, I can burn CDs at the limit of my hardware and the buffer never drops below 98%. One thing I did have to do though, is add memory. Win2K (and XP as well) is a memory hog. I would recommend at least 256 MB of RAM. I upgraded to 512 MB to better accommodate high-end games like No One Lives Forever 2. My Dad recently bought a new computer with Win XP Home Edition. It's supposed to be an improvement over Win2K, but the only significant difference I saw was nag messages for Microsoft services like Passport. I thought that once you paid for the software, it was supposed to *stop* nagging you!. 

$$;
Summary:. This version is stable and it is the probably the best, if you "really" need it. Nobody mentions how to uninstall it but then it isn't something you even consider when buying into something but look hard before you buy into this as it is a nightmare to uninstall especially if you have an OEM version. I own it, don't go near it as I had my debut with this one. Stable like a rock and anchors into your hardrive like an arc weld ! Microsoft offers support to OEM owners on a pay per need basis right from day one. Yes you pay to buy it, you pay to get support and they want you to pay to help you uninstall it !. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows 2000 is basically windows xp with some little features. Its rock solid and performs well.. 

$$;
Summary:. I've been using Win2k for over 2 years now and in that time I've had but one (1) blue screen of death. My PC is left on 99% of the time and the only time I reboot is during an occasional software install. I have been able to run 20 memory intensive applications at once and have never had a problem. I have to hand it to ol' Bill on this one - MS really got it right.. 

$$;
Summary:. Best choice if you do not want to have MS approve every install on your personal system.. 

$$;
Summary:. If you need stability, speed and system securuty, then Windows 2000 Pro is the solution. 

$$;
Summary:. I first got Win2k Pro as a replacement for windows 98SE. It made a world of a difference. Uptime is a lot longer, and you need not worry about all those memory leaks that forced a reboot daily in 98SE. With that said if you do plan to upgrade to windows 2000 get the drivers for your hardware ahead of time. Most importantly your network/modem cards and your video card should be downloaded before hand if you don't already have it. You can always get the rest of them later if you have to. If you do plan to move on to windows XP Pro, then disregard what David Dickerson had to say about upgrade issues. No offense but he got it wrong. First, with win2k Pro and NT4 you can't upgrade with Win XP HOME because Microsoft won't let you. Its all marketing. But you can with 98, 98SE, ME. Second, you can use the Windows XP Pro upgrade package to do a clean install of Windows XP Pro on your machine. Even if you take Windows 2000 off your drive you can still do it. But the XP Pro setup will ask for a windows disk that is eligible for the upgrade during the installation. In your case just put in the windows 2k disk. It will check it, go ok, and ask you to reinsert the Windows XP Pro setup disk and finish the setup. To recap, Windows XP Upgrade packages can do clean installs.. 

$$;
Summary:. It's slow when you boot up, but it's stable and has a good quality and easy to install. You should have at lease 512MB of memory to make it boot faster. You should download service pack 2. I like it.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have used all versions of Windows, including XP professional, but win 2000 is the best among MS OS. Stable and it works without crashes. Of course, I'm obliged to apply all the SP and patches, but nothing is perfect under microsoft... If you are a professional user, I suggest not to upgrade to XP Professional. If you are a network administrator using win 2000 server / Win 2000 Pro, do not consider at all to apply XP on the client side: you will waste too time.. 

$$;
Summary:. Works almost perfectly, compatible with anything outside of DOS games. Win9x/Me is a cheap joke, NT4 is old and somewhat limited, XP is overweight. 2000 is the ideal Windows version. Win9x users shouldn't be afraid, 2000 isn't really that complicated. Reviewers are way off the mark in that area. You can even set it to automatically use a single user account if you're really afraid of that stuff.. 

$$;
Summary:. Upgrade from 98SE in a small home network.. Win98 SE crashed too often on its NAT setting.. Win2K works so well that it has not crashed when I tried to overload the win2K server.. Very stable but XP just a headache as much time was spent to fix the hardware and soft ware.. I have to open the case to put a new hard drive and forget it... 

$$;
Summary:. I have used all OS,s since Win95 including MAC O(S, Win 2000 Pro is by far the most reliable and easiest to use. For the office it is a must. If you use your PC at home for wrigting Cookbooks and surfing the net it will also do the job. On my work PC I installed Win XP Pro, but have gone back Win 2000 pro its lighter and seams faster for my type of work (XP Pro is very stable however). I installed 2000 on my very old Pentium 233 with MMX and 160Meg RAM and have doubled its performance, she now has a new lease of life. 2nd to None Op Sys. Recomend it for Designers who don`t use mac.. 

$$;
Summary:. I exprienced lot of crashes when I was using Win Me, after upgrading my computer to Win2K, blue screen of death is dead!. 

$$;
Summary:. It's a very stable OS--blows aways 9x--those were crash city--and plenty of blue screens and freeze-ups!!--the support could be better--just try calling MS for support--expect to pay for the LONG DISTANCE call unless you live in the Seattle/Redmond WA area. 

$$;
Summary:. I've been running it for nealy a month now at work, I must admit I only installed it as I was getting Explorer GPF's in NT. It hasn't crashed once and once you get used to having the admin tools hidden in the control panel you thin your'e running NT.. 

$$;
Summary:. Win 2K is by far the most stable OS released by MS. Though I had some problems getting my DVD up and running, there have been a lot less BSODs after the upgrade... touch wood. 

$$;
Summary:. If you're searching for an Operating System that let you work without problems : Windows 2000 Pro is for you. But if you use your computer for multimedia, such as mp3 and online videos, for e-mails or for gaming, you should think about upgrading to Windows XP Home Edition or Windows 98 SE, but do not upgrade to Windows ME. Windows 2000 Pro has some problems with peripherals and compatibility, but it offers great performances and a lot of Stability. If you're thinking about upgrading your PC to Windows 2000 Pro, you should also consider Windows XP Pro, that is the new version of Windows 2000.. 

$$;
Summary:. If you have tried multiple os use 2k pro its the most stable and the best I used xp for two weeks and felt better when I switched back. 

$$;
Summary:. It is one year that I'm using win2k(sp2 by now) NO CRUSHES!...but one thing is bad it not handles all games ...I do not know anything about XP...hope it is gonna be better afer about year from now..... 

$$;
Pros:. SOme programs doubled in speed when upgrading from 98. Stable as a rock. Has crashed only 3 times on me in 5 months of use. I go weeks without rebooting. With 98 I had to reboot daily. Almost like 98 without all the drawbacks. Runs faster than XP and seem. 
Cons:. I tried using the upgrade software at first and it crashed my hard drive. Got a new hard drive and the full blown version and its been smooth sailing since.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is very stable, runs most legacy applications, and doesnt have the bloat of winXP. 
Cons:. Has trouble with some older software.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have been running winbloze machines since win 95 and this OS rocks. With XP based on the same kernel all the new applications and games support it. And you can finally get rid of DOS!!!!. 

$$;
Summary:. Having few problems even with unsupported chipset. Though some software doesn't work such as the Adaptec Direct CD that worked with NT4.. 

$$;
Summary:. Used by 15 people, needs rebooting about once a month. Sometimes minor problems with networking.. 

$$;
Summary:. I recently installed a second hand copy of WINDOWS 2000 on my system, as a dual boot with Windows Me. It is recommended that windows 2000 be installed on its own partition, so I used the freeware FIPS to non distructively create another partition. The installation went flawlessly. Windows 2000 would not recognize my old intel combination modem/cam card, which was understandable since Intel doesn't even support the product any more. All of the other hardware, including an inexpensive scanner, were compatible. The system is very stable, and at bootup I choose which Windows i want. I use ME for the multimedia stuff, games, and for the kids use. Windows 2000 is for the "serious" work, using Office, etc, when stability is critical. At this point given what I have read I wouldn't even consider XP. One caveat: when installing as a dual boot system, make up your mind beforehand that you want to finish, as an aborted install can make the hard drive unbootable.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows 2000 is definitely the Windows 98 alternative. Although it isn't meant for gaming, the stability is incredible. The features are amazing. The support could use a little work, but everything else is great!. 

$$;
Summary:. Device drivers are still hard to find in some cases but most can be found. I like it.. 

$$;
Summary:. I upgraded from Windows NT 4 (SP 6) to Windows 2000 Professional very soon after Windows 2000 Professional was released. Despite the usual patches from Microsoft, plus two service packs, I am very glad that I upgraded to Win2k Pro. (I also ended up updating some major hardware, but the investment was a good one.) Microsoft's support of the product get a mixed review from me. Most of the time when I had a problem, Microsoft insisted that my hardware was incompatible, although I had Win2k drivers from all of the hardware manufacturers. At one point, Microsoft support insisted that I flash the BIOS of my motherboard using the lastest version, which was a beta. The representative said he would not assist me until I used the beta flash; I did, and my motherboard died. I also had one representative, Joe, who was so rude that I got him in trouble with his superiors. He always behaved in this manner and I received two written apologies from Microsoft, but -- much to my disappointment -- I ended up getting two more cases assigned to him. Such behavior is inexcusable and Microsoft should terminate any support representative who is rude and insulting. I find XP Pro very tempting, but every time I think that I will "take the plunge," I remember how stable 2000 Pro is and the teething pains I had with it (not to mention the "support trauma") -- and I do not place an order for XP Pro. Finally, if you are running Windows 2000 Pro, have decided to upgrade to XP Pro, and you want to do a "clean install," forget about buying the upgrade version of XP Pro! You MUST purchase the FULL version of XP Pro in order to do a clean installation, although you are eligible for the upgrade version. (I assume that this situation is the result of Microsoft's antipiracy measures, but I always do "clean installs" of new operating systems.) I am still considering XP Professional, but Windows 2000 Professional is a "keeper," and I see no harm in rushing into a decision, particularly after reading many reviews of XP Pro.. 

$$;
Summary:. Iv been working with win2K small buisness server and advanced server . there the best OS's since NT 4.0 Server. Forget XP you'll spend the next 2 months downloading the proper drivers to work with your operating system.. 

$$;
Summary:. NT Workstataion had been Microsofts best user product but it appear Win2000 Pro tops it. Can be hard to find drivers but the stability is well worth the search. Stay away from XP I've tried it ...it's mixing WinMe with 2000 a combination that does not work well WinMe is horrible so why stick with a bad idea ? I used it on a P4 1.6 Gig and it ran like win95 on a 486 thanks Microsoft but nothanks.. 

$$;
Summary:. Win2k is overall very good. "Quality" gets a 4 only because Microsoft has yet to fix problems with their 'active desktop' and I doubt they will be fixed in XP: Microsoft prefers adding in new features rather than fixing old features which still have wrinkles to be ironed out. "Features" meaning how well Win2k being the amalgamation of NT stability + Win98 multimedia capability. "Stability" is top-notch. For an OS which uses ~750 Mb of disk space, Win2K is great. Mac OS X (OX) takes a mammoth 1.5 Gb disk space, and Win XP has a ludicrous 2 Gb requirement -- so obviously I'm not switching to either platform. Win2k is quite ideal. "Support" - Look at Microsoft's wealth and the salaries of the CEOs. Combine that with how not all bugs get fixed (and yet how new OS releases seem to fix more problems than Service Packs), and it is clear Microsoft should not be asking tons of money for support calls. They are a monopoly; they find new ways to get consumers to upgrade. They could be respectable and civil enough to give out free support. (just wait until MS starts laying off their workers...) If Microsoft doesn't fix existing problems (and reduce the size of its OS, of which the reasons are technical and many as to why size DOES matter in an operating system). Microsoft needs to fix its product NOW or else XP's replacement 1~2 years from now will not even sell. Even the most non-technical person can't consistently be fooled.).

Summary:. I have been using this operating system for the past 8 months now. I have never been as pleased with an OS as I am with this one. Stability is one of a kind. The only minor problem that it has is that there are some hardware/software out there that will not run on it. Other than that, if you can afford to buy it, IT IS A MUST BUY!. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks great. Easy to use. Fast enough for me. Didn't like XP at all.. 
Cons:. Freezes frequently and Ctrl+Alt+Delete does nothing. I bought it for stability, but it surely is not. The whole computer is NEW (3 days old) and it has frozen 3x in those three days. I don't play games---just surf and e-mail.. 

$$;
Summary:. This is a great O/S and very comparable to Windows XP even though there is no themes or anything like XP. There are the transition effects though. . Anyways you can run most Windows XP programs on it since it's built off of the NTFS. Very stable, if one program crashes then the whole O/S isn't sucked in with it, a very good task manager is built in. Recommended for those who want something new and don't care much for their older software and games that ran on 98, though some programs still run. Great OS. 

$$;
Summary:. Or else go back to Windows ME for what its worth. Windows 2000 Pro is nothing but a slow pig with very frustrating boot times(make a pot of coffee)and requires a password. Even with the latest SP3, Its still slower than XP or ME. It even refused to accept my modem! And after 3 trys and strikes, 2000 is out!. 

$$;
Summary:. XP is garbage. Please do not buy it people. This is simply the best M$ OS on the market.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have never had to deal with so many application crashes before. I think I would rather save my time and money and reinstall Win98 before I do that again.. 

$$;
Summary:. I have been with MS since DOS 3-WIN 3.0 and have been a fan ever since.I've had two blue screens in the last 3-4 months. I never turn my PC off. I wish there were no blue screens but I wish I owned a island too. My next OS will be Linux though..XP is the end of the road.. 

$$;
Summary:. If you are running only Microsoft made programs and no games, then it will run fine, great. But I use more than just stuff made by Microsoft, every game I have crashes, and it crashes without games running. Lots of nice features, but even if I was running a business I would not use this.. 

$$;
Summary:. I just don't see the point of this upgrade. Runs much slower than NT, eats up memory, cannot see the advantage of using it.. 

$$;
Summary:. For no reason, you will see a program, which is named System8, continuing writing to your hard drive and it will last as long as your computer is on. This stupid thing happened every single time after 2 hours of using the computer. I know this because I saw the hard drive LED was flashing for hours. I then used a program call FileMon, and it showed that System8 is writing something to the disk drive. There are other system programs which do the same thing, but i guess that's enough.. 

$$;
Summary:. There seems to be problems with the way Win2K handles video on my older machines using 32 meg PCI video cards. I get regular crashes on different games in virtually the same way for both systems. If only on one I'd expect the card, but the video cards are different. The only consistency I get is consistent crashes.. 

$$;
Summary:. Poor implementation of Netware's NDS. The install process is still primitive and virtually unchanged from NT. While it's an improvement over NT, anyone with experience with other OSs will be disappointed at the least.. 

$$;
Summary:. Windows 2000.. the Late great model of things to come? i surely hope not. 98 was, at least, commercially viable. the only reason MicroSoft continues to exist is the computer user base. about 95% just don't know any better. Windows is great if you arent burdened with worrying about your systems integrity. about access from without and within. the instabiltiy of the platform as a whole. So just close your eyes, breathe deeply and enjoy your computing experience. ignorance is bliss.. 

$$;
Summary:. Standards for desktop OS today are are set by MS. We all know how 'high' these standards are. Well 2000 hasn't crashed on me yet. so thats pretty good.. 

$$;
Summary:. It is not stable, because the registry and dll hell ! This combination is enough to make it very unreliable.. 

$$;
Summary:. i had problems from the begining, it just never worked it is bloatware and good for nothing i went back to good old reliable windows 95. 

$$;
Summary:. Have 2 machines at home... one has Win2k and the other has Win98se. Win2k has continued to perform well and remain stable through a couple win98se installs on the other machine. Win2k does boot slower, but since it seldom crashes, I seldom have to reboot so not a big deal..
