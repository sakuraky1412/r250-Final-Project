$$;
Pros:. EVERYTHING. 
Cons:. IT'S EXPENSIVE. 

$$;
Pros:. the camera is excellent. Video taking it excellent. Many options or taking best shot in best light etc. It's like having an excellent cam and excellent cal that you can get wet! What could be better for a swimmer like myself?!. 
Cons:. a bit small outer led screen when closed. Hard to read caller ID unless opening phone etc."Vibrate *AND* ring" not an option.. 
Summary:. Buy it, you'll be happy that you did. It's something that you don't (ever?) see hanging around you. It's impressive nad has lived up to all of my high expectations.. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone's 5.1 MP camera does a fine job in most situations, and you can upload photos to other websites. I use mine for mobile broadband, and it gets great signal quality for fast browsing.. 
Cons:. The included software for downloading pictures from the phone to a PC is awful.. 
Summary:. You can get this phone without having to buy one of Verizon's BS data packages, which was its main attraction for me. I used this phone as a dedicated camera on a recent trip to Mexico and it performed really well. Inquisitive schoolchildren loved seeing themselves on its preview screen! It was also usable for calls back to the US, and the call quality was good. It's ruggedized, so I didn't have to worry about downpours or humidity affecting it, unlike other digital cameras I've had in the tropics. I'm currently using it as a modem (tethering is $49.99/mo for 5GB from Verizon), and I'm able to watch Hulu, run Pandora, and browse other sites. It's fast. My only problem has been actually getting the photos off the camera, since the included software has issues maintaining a camera-PC connection during downloads. I suggest using the phone's Bluetooth abilities to download photos and forgoing the included software altogether.. 

$$;
Pros:. Crystal clear and sharp screen; voice clear in and out; less call loss compared to previous verizon phone, ruggedized is important for me (last phones dead 2 by water, 1 by horse); intuitive menu and did I mention the camera/vidoe capabilities - WOW.. 
Cons:. Lack of touch screen, pricey even though I wanted all features that it has. must hardwire to synch w/PC. Can't replace my PDA with this phone and still aim for that with next generation of ruggedized phones. Would like greater micro sd capacity.. 
Summary:. This phone slips easily and safely into my jeans pocket without bulk, screen is visible in room and outdoor light so I can see timers for workingouts for self and horses, alarm will replace my old stand-alone alarm clock with much better tones to announce wake-up, already got water on it when open when our just-bathed Great Pyrennes decided to shake his fur out all over me without any problem for screen or keys. Haven't needed html/net access yet. Have taken and downloaded pics and video clips and have put my 10 mgp Canon on standby as a result ditto 3ccd digital video camera. Imaqes are crisp. Image storage limited by microSD capacity. Still can't replace my PDA with it, though.. For me, bottom line, worth getting, enjoy using.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good speakerphone. quick, NICE,camera. used the lanyard port once-keep valuables tied down to your body. a flashlight on a cell that flashes LIGHT you can SEE by. GPS nav available. sleek design compared to other H-Duty models. Elegant not glitz. 
Cons:. software SNAFUs-lots. must open the phone to turn on flashlight-you get blinded by screen! SEND-CLEAR-END buttons are part of numeric keypad instead of the function keypad. open carefully or camera comes on by mistake. memo recording soooooooo easy!. 
Summary:. I Love my exilim. brilliant pics i can take for myself or show clients with a picture. walk into a group of folks trying to find something on the jobsite or campsite with their phones and light up the area with my exilim-"Hey! thats neat." I waited for the 4G models expecting Casio to bring an awsome camera phone to the table. but, no. Casio dropped pixils to 3 from 5 on the exilim. as a pricy phone, tech support locally was based on removing the battery to see if something happened. the exilim cleans up all the average conference call noise for the rest of the callers. many commented on the sudden clarity. i never forget the Before and after pictures at the jobsite.. Updated. on Oct 14, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Sounds like a great idea with the high-end camera and flash in a flip-phone style. 
Cons:. Casio's website not even mentioning Windows 7 in it's support for this phone, and it's just as bad that they at least support 64-bit in Windows 7.. 
Summary:. It is atrocious that a "high-end" flip phone such as this both isn't compatible with Windows 7 AND any 64-bit version of Windows. Not even Vista 64-bit! I haven't chosen this phone yet, but I may get it for my girlfriend anyway, because she hates her touch screen phone and likes the great camera and flash in this one.. It remains to be seen if I can force the drivers to work with Windows 7, whether 32-bit or 64-bit (I have my ways), but we shouldn't have to worry about this in this day and age. Windows 7 has been out for a year next month.. A suggestion to try for Windows 7 compatibility is using Windows XP Mode (not compatibility mode, emulating XP via Microsoft Virtual PC). I think it supports USB devices. I'm unsure, however, if the host OS requires drivers in order for the drivers in the emulation to work, but it's a thought.. 

$$;
Pros:. I bought this for the camera, and it is versatile and durable, and the photo quality is good.. 
Cons:. Camera settings are a little tricky and it's so light it's easy to shake it and blur the image when you click the shutter button, even in full sun. The real downside is the software for uploading is not compatible with Macs -- a HUGE problem.. 
Summary:. Probably would not have bought it owing to Mac incompatibility, which means I have to send photos over the internet to my Mac, which requires compression and loss of quality. A pretty terrible oversight on Casio's part, and I've found no available Mac-compatible software. Otherwise it's a good camera and a serviceable phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera is pretty great, with a strong zoom.. Call quality is good (not landline perfect but very good).. Speaker phone is loud.. Very very solid feeling. I drop this thing all the time, no problems. The twisting screen isn't flimsy.. 
Cons:. Video is ok, looks more pixelated, and you can only zoom *before* you start shooting.. Battery life is fine/acceptable, but with normal talk time (i.e. you use it as your 'only' phone) you need to charge it every 1-2 nights.. 
Summary:. The camera features are truly camera quality. Flipping the screen around to use as viewer is *genius* and having the buttons on top that feel like real camera buttons make it as easy/simple/intuitive to use as a regular old camera.. With the microSD slot you can take a lot of pictures/videos. NOTE: to use the sync dock, you need to be running XP home or older (seriously!), but its not necessary if you save all your photos/etc a flash card and then put that directly into your computer. ***IF YOU USE A MICROSD CARD THIS PHONE *IS* COMPATIBLE WITH MAC***. Most ruggedized phones (i.e. something that's not gonna break every time it gets bumped) are UGLY and huge/fat. This phone is larger than a lot of other flip phones, but no so big that its a big deal, mostly because its slim and sleek (fits in your pocket).. I had a cheap samsung flip phone (samsung smooth) that had abysmal call quality, and I wanted to find something with acceptable battery life and CLEAR CALLS so I wouldn't be constantly repeating myself. This gets good signal but also has good speaker quality (you hearing the caller) and good microphone quality (them hearing you).. Verizon doesn't make you have a data plan with this phone, which was a plus for me (i'm attached to my computer all day, don't need a smartphone). It does do some limited data stuff like VCast etc.. I haven't dropped it in water (yet!) but considering the rest of its 'ruggedized' features hold up, I would assume it really can take a dunking with out shorting out (we've all been there!!).. 

$$;
Pros:. 1) like the size, way it fits in my hand. 2) not worried about dropping it or letting it get a little wet. built for some abuse. 3) easy to read screen, keys big enough for my hand. 4) menus + shortcut buttons=easy. 5) EXCELLENT clarity and volume.. 
Cons:. (1) It was expensive. (2) the camera is a pain in the neck. The pic quality is good, but messing with options like back light, flash, etc. a real drag. 
Summary:. If I lost it, I'd buy the same one again. My favorite camera of all I've owned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Swivel screen makes it just like a point &#38; shoot 5 MP camera. Got the larger battery, but 3rd day w/normal battery and only lost one bar of battery life. Now I have two batteries. I was able to load songs on the microSD and play on the phone.. 
Cons:. Flash is inadequate in low light and can only download pictures from the camera memory. I would like to upload games and ringtones.. 
Summary:. I would recommend it. I am enjoying this phone. Great camera in the daylight.. 

$$;
Pros:. I am replacing my bolder with an exilim and I used my bolder USB cable to connect the exilim to the PC and download my test pictures from the exilim. it worked great. The docking station is not requred to connect it to a PC or laptop.. 
Cons:. None yet .. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera, Optical Zoom, Keyboard, Fit/Finish, Flip/Rotate Screen, Water/Dust Resistance, Shortcut Keys. 
Cons:. Mediocre Contact List &#38; Groups, Mediocre Appointment Scheduling, Mediocre Photo Editing. 
Summary:. Last week, I upgraded my 3-year old Samsung A990 to the new Casio Exilim C721, and have now used this phone extensively and formed some strong opinions.. The GOOD news:. G1) C721 has a good camera, including optical zoom. I like the photos and controls, and feel this upgrade from 3.2 Mp to 5.1 Mp is important. G2) VZ Navigator works almost everywhere on the C721, including inside many buildings where I know many competitors won't operate well.. G3) I like the flexibility of assigning shortcuts on the C721 in comparison to the more limited A990.. G4) Great screen, easy to use keyboard, nicely lit keyboard.. G5) Nice size, fits well in my hand.. G6) Very good battery life.. G7) The flip and rotate screen is great! Using the phone as a camera easy and natural.. G8) Decent sound quality for rings and speaker phone. Good phone reception and operation.. G9) One button shortcut to place into vibrate mode, turn on speaker, activate voice control, speed dial, lock the phone, and more.. G10) Instant response, no hesitation to any function - except camera does take a couple of seconds to start.. G11) Water &#38; Dust resistance - should come in handy in future.. The bad news (B1-4). Most of the new features I was hoping to be upgraded (aside from the camera) still have most of the same A990 disappoointing limitations; some are quite irksome. I don't know if it is Casio or Verizon who are responsible for this poor software.. B1) Verizon calendar functionality is mediocre.. The C721 can't: tie appointments to contacts and/or notes. It does not permit setting default values for appointment fields. It forces me to specify CDT vs CST. Why not give me the option of just specifying CT without the "D" or "S". Let the cell network figure out whether daylight savings time is active.. B2) C721 contact groups are limited to a max of 10 entries. How in the world do programmers think you can sell a phone with 500 or 1000 phone contacts and only permit a max of 10 contacts per group?. B3) When I looked up contacts on the A990, I would just open the phone and type the starting letters of a name. For example, to look up "Elaine", just type: 352 (more digits if you like) and press UP arrow. Contacts matching 352 would pop-up. Fast and simple. With the C721, I have to use contact search method (also available on A990): press "Contacts", and multi-tap through names: C335552 - typically twice the keystrokes.. I don't appreciate search for contacts only by matching characters at the beginning of name. I need to search by any portion of name, by phone number or area code. I store names as "Bob Jones". I want to search for "Jones" and also find "Bob Jones".. The A990 had a note field associated with each contact; the C721 has dropped this important feature.. Overall, this phone has barely adequate, mediocre contact list &#38; group software functionality.. B4) Casio photo editing software is inadequate. My A990 provided ability to rotate, crop and size, annotate, copy &#38; paste, apply various effects to photos. The C721 cannot rotate photos, cannot perform the majority of A990 photo editing functions, and the minimal crop &#38; resize are only of limited use. I'm really disappointed by the mismatch of software to this better type of camera - a significant step down from what I had with the A990.. Summary. Well, I got the improved optics, resolution, and optical zoom I wanted in this upgrade from my old Samsung A990 to the new Casio Exilim C720. Pretty much everything else is on par with what I had or a downgrade. With better software, I would rate the camera 4.5 out of 5.0, but have to rate it 3.5 instead. With better contact and calendar software, ease of use should have been a full point higher than the 3.0 rating I giving the C721. I'm also giving myself a "2" for making the decision to do this upgrade. I should have continued to wait for a more significant camera-phone product. And for those of you who would suggest the Samsung Omnia 5 Mp phone - I've used one for about a week, and didn't like it either. I'm convinced that Verizon just doesn't offer a high-quality full-featured camera-phone product yet in the USA.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the ruggedized qualities. Mine has been dropped---hard. It has been under water. Never fazed it. Camera great. I remove chip and place into computer to view pictures. This works better than docking for me.. 
Cons:. When talking, must close vehicle windows. Wind noise makes it impossible for others to hear. Must open phone to see clock and person calling because display on front too small and dim. Other phones have better speaker quality.. 
Summary:. My phone must be water tight and be able to bounce a little. Of the progression of Casio's tough phones, this has been the best by far. Although the front display is too small and dim to be of use, the phone's main display is great and is almost usable in bright sunlight.. The phone is easy to operate. The camera and video take some getting used to but after owning the phone for a couple of years, is is now simple to operate.. My problem with the phone is the lousy microphone. Any wind noise and the other party cannot hear me. Also, the speaker is not on par with other phones that play music, etc. I suspect that both of these problems are largely a result of making the phone water tight---which is the main reason I bought this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. The ring volume is loud.Thats a good thing compared to my g'z one.Real bright display.Easier to hold to ear on shoulder than the g'z.I like the camera side of it.Was the reason I went with it.. 
Cons:. Volume buttons are to small and smooth.Having problems editing photos and sending them back to phone.For some reason ATT customers can't receive picture messages,file size to large. 
Summary:. Over all it is a good phone for everyday use.You don't have to worry about dropping it and it breaking.Even better if you drop it in water.I think most of you know what I mean.I like how slim it is and not as clunky as the G'z one.Feels good in the hand not heavy,but there.It can be dressed up with skins.I would like to be able to have front display clock stay on.And be able to store contacts on card.The rest of my dislikes are mainly with Verizons software.And the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Water Resistant. 
Cons:. USB Driver not compatible with Windows 7. 
Summary:. UNSATISFACTORY!!! The USB driver for this phone is not compatible with Windows 7. There is no update available from Casio. You will NOT be able to connect to laptop or PC. NO AccessManager, NO MobileBroadband. Those and many other advertised features require a USB connection which is not possible to any Windows 7 computer. THIS IS TOTALLY UNSATISFACTORY.. 

$$;
Pros:. good camera. good receiving sound quality.. 
Cons:. poor microphone, caller cannot hear you. problem with contact list vanishing everynight with the first phone I received.. 
Summary:. What I wanted was a phone. The first one I got, the contact list vanished like 3 times, explainably. Also people cannot hear me talk. Sent it back, now no problem with the contact list, but people still say I sound muffled and too much background noise. Contacted Verizon, asked to change to another phone, they wanted $20 for "upgrade" to a cheaper phone (which my husband has to problem with) + $35 restocking fee. Not helpful @ all. When asked what recourse a customer has with faulty design her answer was that there are 5 star reviews on the phone and to keep returning the product until you get one that works for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Verizon interface, ease of transition from one function to another.. 
Cons:. Photo quality, delay in response when viewing picture folder, no on-board photo software on camera, compartment covers for battery and micro SD card were too flimsy, flexible and difficult to open without fear of (future and inevitable) breakage.. 
Summary:. I bought it because I do photo augmenting and liked the notion and convenience of having a high resolution camera without having to carry more than just a cell phone with me. But the pictures I took were just too washed out. When setting the resolution at its highest, picture quality only got worse. The only semi-decent quality pictures were those taken in full sunlight.. There was an unacceptable time delay when opening the picture folder. The camera is set up to show three thumb nails when initially accessed. You HAVE to wait for the thumb nails to open before the camera would permit you to exit the function (should you have pressed it by accident).. There is very little you can do with a photo. You are pretty much obligated to just accept the shot as you have taken it. Any 'corrections' you might want to apply to a photo have to be performed prior to the actual snap shot. Unless you're a professional photographer, you don't know what lighting corrections will need to be done.. The covers for the battery and SD card compartments were rather suspect and appeared to be vulnerable to future breakage. While I know that they have to be tightly sealed for moisture prevention, they were constructed of plastic and flexed too much. And, after all, plastic doesn't have too high a resiliency and will slowly crack after too much flexing. Further, the SD card cover was the ONLY reason that the SD card stayed in place. It just wouldn't 'lock' when pushed into the slot.. Perhaps I was spoiled. I had the Motorola Razr v9m prior to this camera. The v9m did let you do a modicum of photo correction and augmenting. It also let you do video editing for length. That was why I bought the Casio Exilim C721. I thought it would be in the same realm as the v9m since it was a high res camera phone. Sadly, it was not. I ended up taking it back and getting the Envy Touch. And to my surprise, it does with photos what I was looking for as well as with videos. And the picture quality here? Well, that's my next review... 

$$;
Pros:. Love the camera and the GPS feature. I like being able to grab the one device I always have on me and get great results from it for what matters to me. I really don't care about being wired to the web...just a phone, a camera, and a gps is great!. 
Cons:. It just stopped working! Fully charged battery this morning, pix this afternoon, 40 minutes tried to call. Phone is DEAD. Recharged the battery. Not the battery. Took it to Verizon. Confirmed not the battery, and a replacement is enroute.. 
Summary:. For a phone that is supposedly mil-spec to die a seemingly random death only 40 days after purchase is suspect. I now seriously wonder if the next phone is going to do the same thing. Casio truly makes some tough products, but the camera phone now has me wondering. Before today's incident, I would gladly have rated it 4.5 stars. In 6 weeks I will update this entry. I hope this was just a one in a million fluke, but I just read a reviewer who is now working on his 3rd copy of this phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera was very nice. 
Cons:. Battery life is to short (needs more battery). Sound is horrible and cracks alot; had to replace the phone 3 times and every single time the sound quality would crack after a few days. Don't get this phone!!!. 
Summary:. To much money for what you get; maybe after its been out for awhile this phone would be a much better buy after all the bugs have been worked out.. 

$$;
Pros:. - camera quality is not so bad unless you are a professional photographer, then its pretty bad. voice quality is somewhat clear. -texting is very easy due to the large buttons. -speakers are passable. -sleek design. -twisting screen. -water resistant. 
Cons:. -Camera is very tricky to use with diagonal pictures. -pictures are hardly customizable. -screen is too small for a phone this big. i expected at least a 3 inch. -mp3 cannot be used as ringtones. -highly uncustomizable phone in general. 
Summary:. The phones exterior is fairly nice but its the things inside of it that are horrendous... it comes pre-loaded with 6 horrible and irritating ringtones. Pictures cannot be rotated. I try to use pictures i took as wallpaper and it always says "Exceeded file size" It claims it can use recorded sounds as ringtones but IT CAN'T! instead it is pure silence.. IT TOOK 1 MINUTE AND 28 SECONDS TO SEND A PICTURE WITH -FULL RECEPTION-!!! Imagine how it is when sending a video. My other 20 dollar phone took less than 10 seconds... the primary screen is very small for a phone thats 7 1/2 inches in total length. Sending animated messages or messages with emo-cons only works verizon-to-verizon.. internet experience is very limited and one page on a computer comes out as like 4 pages on the phone. It only reads english characters so if you read things in different languages, it comes out as boxes. However, the internet loads faster than my dsl at home. YOUTUBE does not work. The phone cannot download ANY files whatsoever so YOU CAN'T SEND RINGTONES VIA MESSAGE OR LINK. Phone has a nice design and is very glossy HOWEVER! this is what makes it easier to scratch. 1 month after i bought it, it's covered in scratches, i can't even see anymore gloss and I don't even do anything with that phone but stick it in my pocket.. The screen in the front is too small... surprised it even fit the time. It cannot display a 24 hour clock on this screen, which is the format i have been using since i can remember.... Frankly the only thing this phone is good for is looks, texting, and calling and -nothing else-. Want a nice camera? Buy it seperately. If you are like me (customizing everything, taking advantage of internet capabilities, and want a -way- above average phone) this phone is not for you. Buy it if you want to be disappointed or you want something to make you mad.. i paid 280 dollars for this?? You're better off buying the latest greatest cell phone from japan on ebay and unlocking it via hypersim. American service provider's phones are sadly.... terrible. 40/100 (phones here in america) 120/100 (the rest of the world). buy an unlocked phone somewhere and stick with a gsm network..

$$;
Pros:. Camera and style. 
Cons:. Even though calendar says it saves recurring events, it does NOT, as confirmed by Verizon Tech Support (who was as surprised as I, when they checked it out).. 
Summary:. A camera with a phone as an add-on! NOT a professional grade phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Absolutely none.. 
Cons:. Not even a nice camera- not really waterproof... HORRIBLE sound quality... Terrible terrible terrible phone.. 
Summary:. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE..
