Performance reduction here is much less than superpi would suggest .
In Super Performance mode CPU, Z shows the bus speed to increase up to 169 .
It enhances performance, but is not absolutely necessary because this unit is a full featured machine .
No noticeable performance reduction
Performance is good, screen very good, wireless very good, numerous USB ports, and keyboard layout is excellent .
Battery performance couldn't be more nice, as well as performance .
0 out of 5 stars Excellant Portability and Performance, August 14, 2009
faster overall performance, and shorter charge life on the battery .
Very acceptable performance for what netbooks are designed to do .
The Wireless performance is great .
0 out of 5 stars Good ergonomics, exceptional battery, performance meets expectations .
It freaked me out since I wasn't running anything high performance .
1 light weight, 2 long battery life, and 3 reasonable performance .
Otherwise its performance has been bug, free and met all expectations .
I expect to get 6, 7 hours in high performance mode .
The Eee Super Hybrid Engine utility lets users overclock or underclock their Eee PC's to boost performance or provide better battery life depending on their immediate requirements .
I have the Super Hybrid Engine set to auto mode, which I'm guessing is less than High or Super Performance   .
Overall though, I am happy with the performance .
Asus' center of excellance is in very reliable, very stable, high performance circuitry, mainly motherboards .
Comes with unusually well, written documentation, though I'm still a little fuzzy on the different power, saving performance modes :
