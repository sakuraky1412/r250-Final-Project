unlike the 1tb lacie i also own , which houses the same hitachi drive , this external drive has performed perfectly updated  .
on aug 29 , 2008  .
have been using the 1 tb drive from best buy since 2 weeks and it has been spectacular so far  .
performs like a champ , no complaints  .
only thing is that i really had to boot up and then format the whoel drive myself  .
but overall i called tech support and they totally sorted me out and my babay is ready to go 1 tb is like opening doors to my downloading like never before  .
so far put 700 gb on it  .
all brand new stuff man  .
thats my whole collection dude  .
going to see if i can dump something else on it too  .
its real tiny so it can fit in a bag  .
noiseless , stealth and cool with its red glow in the dark folks cant go wrong with this product go get it  .
i think cnet should rate this device higher .
this is a great hard drive by a wonderful company that provides amazing customer service when needed  .
this unit is capable of fitting close to 1tb (little bit less , about 160gb cause it is formatted) , in an enclosure that is not so big the upsides of this unit are the capacity , price is not so bad , the enclosure looks nice , it is a quiet hard drive , that does not seem to overheat a whole lot there are some downsides to the unit , which is why i gave it four stars  .
these include that it is a plastic enclosure over aluminum or some material that might keep the drive a bit cooler , there is no fan built in even though there is space for one , and i have not been able to get the back    up button to work  .
hitachi could have also added firewire or e    sata to the drive , but it is ok cause vist doesn ; t seem to like firewire anyways the downsides are minimal , as the drive really stays somewhat cool , and the capacity , price , and brand name make it worth buying  .
it must also be kept in mind that since it is a 1tb hard drive , it may be a bit slow at saving or looking up data , but the speed is actually pretty good  .
it took 60gb back up in about 20 hours , i would have expected a bit faster performance of writing  .
i have maxtor 100gb without external that is pretty faster than that , i will buy simple tech raid also and compare with this if that is faster  .
i cant predict reliability , as the time factor grows  .
but price should be no more than 220$ at the most  .
i have 3 of them on ebay  .
casablanca    import $259 shipped .
i love it , its about half the size of those tb stations , and works well  .
only personal issue is , i bought it for storage option for when i convert to a mac when leopard releases , but fat32 only accepts 4gb files , something my 18gb videos from family events wont work with  .
so overall , its great , compact , and lots of room i cannot comment on the backup software but can only assume its good to go and standard .
i thought that this hard drive is very neat when i first purchased it  .
i liked how hitachi made an external 1tb hard drive so compact  .
however , there's a problem with the stability of this external hard drive  .
at the slightest movement of the hard drive , my computer becomes unable to detect the drive , and files i am downloading temporarily disappear this hard drive is far too fragile , and hitachi should've done a better job of manufacturing it  .
the outer casing is not strong at all  .
for future reference , i would like to see hitachi do a far better job making external hard drives , so when the hard drives are relocated by users , they wo not become unstable and stop performing , as mine occasionally does  .
a good hard drive should always be detected , no matter where you put it on your desk .
first of all this product seems to explain on the box and the papers inside that you get some sort of software , which is totally misconcieving and nowhere to be found while my computer is already starting to have problems this seems to have made them worse it seems to had failed my driver software and now i cannot connect to the internet and of course it's to late to return it so go figure  .
very disapointing when you spend so much on something and it do not work properly  .
six printed pages of instructions to return product full of threats and demands  .
packaging demands unreasonable could not be met by ups or mail boxes etc  .
western industries recommended but not listed in denver , colorado  .
cost by mail boxes estimated at $65 for $100 defective product .
i have purchased many hard drives and i have found that it is mainly hitachi drives that i have ever had a problem with  .
i decided to give this drive a chance because it is cheap and i thought maybe they got their act together and produced a stable product  .
however with all the debating and hesitation i decided to purchase this upright drive  .
it did the same as all the other hitachi drives that i have used , it crashed  .
i realize these things happen , but to this degree and volume it cannot be tolerated  .
i lost over 500gb of data that cannot be replaced , or only at an astronomically high price  .
i would not recommend this product to anyone , not until they can improve their products , perhaps only in solid state drives  .
as an alliterative i have decided to go to the most trusted drive in my experience seagate .
i recommend that you stay away from this hitachi drive as it does not have the stamina required for actual storage .
had this hard drive for a little over a month  .
is working great until it tipped over and fell (it is on the ground so it just fell on its side)  .
it immediately stopped working  .
this hard drive is very easy to break and personally i would not recomend this drive to anyone who wants a cheap buy  .
the only pro in my situation is the customer service  .
they are great  .
i had a 650 gb hard drive and they are sending a 1tb to me  .
just be very careful as it is very fragile  .
i bought two of these drives from a big box store and soon they started shutting down  .
to get them to start up again i had to turn the switch off and back on  .
finally i took them back and exchanged them  .
they did the same thing , so i took them back for another exchange  .
the salesperson at the big box store suggested i take them out of the enclosure and put them in one that had a fan and some cooling  .
so , i did  .
but by doing so i voided the warranty  .
the failed in no time  .
i checked the serial number and it is still in warranty so i sent them to hitachi after getting an rma  .
they sent them back with the reason that i voided the warranty by removing them from the case  .
i tried to explain why i did that but they were unresponsive and did not offer any alternative to the problem  .
just sorry about that but that's our policy  .
this fell 1 foot off of my table onto padded floor and stopped working immediately  .
to recover files , geek squad wanted to charge 1500  .
00 for recovery as this is damaged from a simple fall onto the floor  .
poor durability  .
beware when purchasing this item  .
going with a different brand is worth the money .
numerous reports of this problem in multiple forums , including this one read and learn   http  //www  .
fatwallet  .
com/t/18/782358/  .
drive shuts down and restarts every 30 min or so data loss caused during reset network interuption during reset not an isolated problem , lots of reports but the really uncomplimentary part is ,  .
hitachi tech support is aware of the issue and will not respond 2  .
cnet knew damn good and well it is happening when they wrote this report i do not trust either one of them now .
do not buy this drive  .
i am sorry i did ; over $300 wasted  .
it turns off every 30 minutes , meaning that    .
if you are playing a game installed on this drive , you will lose all progress and the game will shut down 2  .
if you are uploading from this drive , you better complete your upload in 30 minutes or less  .
if it takes longer , your upload will fail when the drive shuts down  .
in my case , resume upload did not work , as the sudden cut    off of the transfer resulted in corrupt files 3  .
if you have any programs installed on this drive , you will lose all your work when the drive shuts down in short , this drive is pointless  .
buy a lacie instead , lacie drives  just work   .
does not work .
i purchased this drive to back up my data and everything seemed fine until my computer crashed and had to restore my data  .
not only is my data unaccessible , when i called customer service for warranty service , they declined because i could not find my sales receipt and they said the one year warranty had expired  .
i will never buy a hitachi drive again  .
i would recommend that when you purchase a hard drive , go with a vendor who offers more than a one year warrnanty because hard drives are prone to defects  .
seagate offers a 5 year warranty and it will come in handy when you need support  .
stay away from hitachi  .
you will regret it .
this is probably the single worst piece of hardware i have ever had the misfortune to own  .
it feels cheap and it is  .
unlike some other drives that will switch off when your pc does this drive stays on until you switch it off  .
it does not have a back up button    the button does nothing at all but look nice and the software installed is a joke  .
aside from these minor issuees these drives just do not work  .
i have had 4 of them    all returned to hitachi and replaced  .
i bought a 1 tb for piece of mind back    up and instead i got a piece of crap that has got my back up  .
terrible    hitachi should be ashamed of allowing such a half baked unit to be sold with there name on it  .
oh    and it's slow too    don ; t get suckered in by the cnet review  .
there aren't enough words to describe how bad this thing is  .
it's like a horrible joke that wo not stop .
have tried to get help from hitachi with little success  .
do not buy  .
this drive disconnects every 30 minutes and some how my itunes library is destroyed i have a backup but lost some content  .
do not buy  .
