oh yes , the best iphone alternative , though the windows phone is looking good .
i have previously owned several different smartphones from several different manufacturers , including samsung .
each of them presented its own problems and things i did n't like about them .
with the captivate , samsung has solved all of those problems and fixed the things i did n't like about the other smartphones .
the 1ghz processor is very fast , especially when connected to a wifi network .
the 16gb of internal storage is more than adequate for the average user .
i am not an average user , however , and i have added a 16gb micro sd card .
i download apps from the market , pictures and sound files sent via mms , and pictures and sound files from various search engines and apps daily and still have about 14gb of total storage left .
i do n't have a lot of full songs stored but i plan to do that soon .
the android market has proven to have more than enough apps to suit my needs , whether it be games , weather , music , or photo editing .
when the rare app is introduced that is not available in the market , i almost always find a comparable app , usually for free .
after several months of using swype texting , i would be very concerned if i had to revert back to a physical keyboard , even a qwerty style .
not only is swype very fast , once you get the hang of it -LRB- and once it begins to learn your frequently used words -RRB- , it 's also fun .
plus , it works in any application where you use a keyboard for text entry .
the 5mp camera takes great pictures and 720p video with 5 .
1 audio .
of course , this is only at full resolution .
videos taken to be sent as mms are much lower quality , not much better than some 3mp cameras i 've used in other devices .
there are several photo editing apps out there that will provide you with hours of fun making funny photos and editing with tools such as red eye removal and color balancing .
the only thing i have found that my captivate wo not do , which my wife 's iphone 4 will do , is video calls in applications such as yahoo messenger .
but i 'm usually on my laptop when we share a video call , so it 's not an issue right now .
i 'll admit that the front facing camera would be nice to have , but that 's just one tiny negative against a whole bushel full of positives overall , it is my personal and humble opinion that the samsung captivate is the best smartphone available right now .
yes , there are a few minor negatives , but when they 're weighed against the major positives , i am very pleased and satisfied with the captivate .
a friend of mine is stubbornly clinging to his iphone 4 for dear life and if he 's ever on a boat that sinks , i 'm sure it will serve as a handy life preserver , especially with his rubber case .
this is an exceptional phone .
i thought i would never change from my iphone but this product has def .
done it .
the samsung captivate is an amazing product , and an extremely compelling alternative to the iphone 4 .
there are certain defining qualities that make the iphone such a great phone , its simplicity , usability , functionality .
these qualities also make it very bland , utilitarian , and in my mind , boring .
so i could n't have been happier when at t finally got a high end android phone the captivate is a great piece of hardware running cutting edge software .
the phone itself feels durable and solid in the hand , despite being refreshingly light .
the screen is nice and big without feeling obnoxiously so .
the 4 superamoled screen , like i said before , is amazing .
amazingly bright and vivid , its got great viewing angles and is easy to see in direct sunlight .
under the hood , with a 1ghz hummingbird cpu , 512mb of ram , 16gb of rom -LRB- with support for up to 32gb microsd cards -RRB- , the captivate firmly falls on the side of bleeding edge mobile tech .
a front facing camera and led flash are all that separates it from being basically the most advanced phone on earth .
-LRB- bear those two things in mind when looking at this phone , if videochat/pictures are a deal breaker for you , then look elsewhere -RRB- .
on the software side of things , android and touchwiz 3 .
0 are both great .
touchwiz adds that aesthetically pleasing factor that vanilla android sometimes lacks , while android remains in the background as the ultra functional , incredibly customizable os of choice for techophiles .
that in no way means this phone would be inaccessible to non tech savvy people , anyone whose used a smartphone will be right at home .
the iphone still edges in terms of pure ease of use , but the captivate will not be difficult to use for most people out there .
and in terms of customizability , the iphone is out of its league .
choose your favorite browser , favorite keyboard , favorite sms client , favorite email client , ect your not stuck inside a closed ecosystem , you have access to pretty much whatever you want .
this is what makes android great , and if you find it appealing , then look no further overall , i can not give the captivate anything less than 5 stars .
yes it lacks a front facing camera , and a led flash .
but those were things i knew when i bought the phone , and you should not rate a product lower for a feature you knew that it lacked from the onset .
do not buy a touchscreen phone and complain that its tougher to text on than your blackberry .
but my experience so far with the captivate has been nothing but positive , and i have absolutely zero regrets with my purchase .
i actually left sprint for att and loved it every since .
had the evo crappy with the 2 .
2 froyo .
the captivate is easy to figure out without needing to root in order to get blocked apps .
5 stars from me .
i have read so many reviews that were up and down , i is nervous about getting this phone .
i is wrong and i am very thankful for it .
i work in the information technology field , i love what i do and i love having the option to customize .
now do n't get me wrong , i did not get this phone for work e mail or half the stuff it professionals will do with the captivate .
however , i still like to play with settings and i have not run into any issues or lagging time in anything that i have done with the phone .
if you 're unsure do not be , i have never had the phone shut off , or had problems with volume , etc .
i got the phone with about 75 % of battery life and i did download the advanced task killer as well .
it has been 15 hours and my battery is still at 25 % .
i am still waiting for the phone to die so that i can fully charge it , so already i am very pleased with the battery life on this smartphone .
i bought my wife an iphone 3gs about 5 months ago , and it had to be replaced within 2 weeks because the battery life is too short .
i have played with the iphone a good amount and i just don .
t see how it can be compared to this phone .
i am not knocking anyone , to each his own .
my wife loves her iphone and i love my captivate .
for those of you wondering if you should get this phone , i hope this helps .
this phone is great for bot office and personal lifestyles .
there is so much that it does that it made me walk away from my iphone and upgraded to this .
the camera is incredible and they way it handles anything that comes its way is extraordinary .
kudos to samsung for coming up with the phone .
i love it .
if you want the best and do n't know what to choose on at t 's gsm network , then you 're probably in a toss up between the iphone 4 and the samsung captivate .
i is in this very same dilemma .
i is so tired of the iphone and the way that the interface is set up that i just wanted something different , swype texting , a new way to unlock my phone , just a different , and fun experience .
so far i am completely satisfied with my choice of the captivate over the iphone 4 .
i hate that i can not use the convenience of itunes , but other than that i love the phone .
it 's a great change of pace .
i do not think you will be disappointed updated .
on oct 12 , 2010 .
first of all , i 'm a geek -LRB- software engineer -RRB- coming back from the iphone -LRB- long story there -RRB- .
i do not care much about the social media geatures of the phone , and even the phone part itself that much .
in my oppinio a good phone is a pocked device that can send/receive emails , have a calendar , alarm clock and most importantly a good browser -LRB- the later take blackberry out of the equation -RRB- .
being able to write apps is great , but not a deal breaker this phone provides all of those features via a gorgeous -LRB- and easy on my eyeys -RRB- oled display .
the browser is pretty close to a desktop as they get on 4 screen .
email functionality is almost on par with bb -LRB- almost -RRB- -RRB- media playback is , imho , better than iphone , since you 're not locked into itunes overall , the phone is really good , comfortable and definitely worth the $ 2400 it will cost over the 2 year term .
love the phone , i is wavering on leaving at t for sprint or verizon for their selection of android phones , especially since i is hooked on android after my g1 dev phone .
i is pleasantly surprised when i walked in for a sony xperia and walked out with a captivate , that decision has to be one of the best decisions i have made for a phone in a long time .
this phone makes a great business phone and an even better show off phone .
be prepared to play with the settings to get the most out of the battery life , but once you do you wo not be able to keep your hands off of this phone .
a must have for the disillusioned at t customer .
it might just make you dislike at t 's quirks a little less .
bought the samsung captivate on amazon .
com for $ 89 with a new 2 year contract screen is beautiful , usb plug at top -LRB- where it belongs . -RRB-
, ridiculously light , great reception and call quality in my experience , gps is slower to lock onto a signal than my dedicated gps unit but otherwise gps works well have not had a problem getting the captivate linked to my pc .
you do need to open a notification screen to get your pc to recognize the phone .
as of this date , you can download samsung kies desktop software and drivers from samsung 's european sight .
froyo apparently is on its way battery life about 12 16 hours with heavy use if you manage wifi , bluetooth , and turn screen off when not in use .
gps will drain battery faster than other apps att prevents sideloading of apps but android central has a desktop application that allows sideloading -LRB- i used it for merckmedicus -RRB- google voice recognition works well and you can dictate text messages -LRB- at least short ones -RRB- .
google maps is the best gps service available and always getting better .
google voice allows you to send text messages without a text messaging plan from att .
multiple keyboard applications including swype , which works amazingly well the captivate is a great android experience .
the samsung captivate seems to be a piece of technology that somehow wound up here in 2010 from the distant future .
it learns how you use it effortlessly , increasing efficiency and productivity .
the swype text input method is truly astounding , though occasionally inaccurate .
it 's camera , though temperamental to focus , takes high quality photos , this coupled with the many photo manipulation apps on the market , brings a valuable dimension to this phone 's multimedia capability .
i is on the fence between the iphone 4 and the new androids .
my wife got an iphone and after using it , i realized that the only thing the iphone 4 has going for it is the games .
most of the major apps like twitter , facebook , and pandora are available for both phones .
the only app that i can not find on the android market is that cool chase banking app that takes pictures of checks the captivate has all the google apps -LRB- some not available for the iphone -RRB- for free .
the best one is the speech to text .
i drive a lot , and found texting while driving to be very dangerous .
now , all i do is push a button , speak the sentence and it types it out for me the google maps app adds google navigation -LRB- not available on iphone -RRB- which gives turn by turn directions in bird 's eye view and reroutes you if you miss a turn .
you can do voice search for anything , and it also shows traffic if you use gmail , the android syncs everything .
i created a new appointment on google calendar and it showed up on my captivate within seconds .
same went for my contacts and picasa pics if you need access to your word , excel , or pdf files , google docs is a must .
i have access to all my google docs , which i can download , open , edit and email to my clients i replaced at t 's voicemail with google voice -LRB- not available on iphone -RRB- .
it takes visual voicemail to the next level .
not only can you see the time , caller , etc , but now the entire message gets transcribed into text the contact list brings all your social networks together , like facebook , twitter , and google talk .
so i can see who is available to chat with on google talk just from looking at my contact list .
the contact 's profile uses the facebook profile pic as a media player , i prefer the captivate over the iphone .
since the captivate supports bluetooth 3 .
0 , and does n't require itunes , i can drag and drop any media file without ever connecting the phone to a computer .
there is also an app on the captivate -LRB- allshare -RRB- that streams any shared media file on the network finally , emailing is not restricted like the iphone .
i can attach any and as many files i want .
the iphone does not even have an attachment function because you can not have access to any files on the phone .
does everything easily , gps , alarms , they thought of everything .
easy to use with windows 7 pc .
use for tethering and file storing .
i use this phone for everything , radio , music , work .
and support is good , i downloaded a renegade apps , and it messed up my phone , i bought it back from the dead in an hour , no loss love it .
if you 're looking for the ultimate smartphone and want an upgrade from your ido not this is a dream come true .
the hummingbird processor is a leap of faith by samsung and it delivered .
the speed of this phone is phenomenal .
the bottom line is this the samsung captivate blows away the competition especially the i phone which is considered by millions to be the best .
no way i is an i phone user and believer but there were too many problems with it .
this phone however is a amazing very easy to use and understand and the colors and graphics are simply stunning .
in the last week i have converted 4 i phone users to the captivate i strongly recommend that everyone who likes smart phones to run not walk to a store and pick one up you will not be disappointed .
i love this phone .
everyday i discover a new feature on the phone kies software is the best i have seen in a long time it converts videos formats , syncs to outlook .
and the best it lests you tethering check this link for the kies software http / / www .

wow , this thing is da ' bomb .
i 'm only about 4 days in so i plan to update my review later .
but so far i love the phone for all the reasons i could n't love the iphone 4 -LRB- which i thought is impressive in many respects , but which i got rid of after less than a week -RRB- .
for starters , the captivate -LRB- aka galaxy s for at t -RRB- feels so much lighter and slimmer .
i can hold it comfortably in my hand and text or put it in my pocket without feeling like i am toting around a lead weight .
the android os is like the iphone os on casual friday a very similar selection of perks without all the stuffy rules .
you can liberally customize this thing to your hearts content , and yet the android based ui has comparable features like the ability to manipulate icons on multiple screens .
there are a few worthwhile compromises when comparing it to the iphone .
the captivate display is not quite as high res , in that you can see the pixels if you get close but the captivate it so much lighter in weight and the surface area of the display is even larger , that the trade is more than fair .
you wo n't be dissapointed with the screen , even if the iphone 4 may win in an isolated comparison .
the battery life is also much better than i is experiencing with the iphone right out of the box .
text input is a dream .
you have the option of three different input modes that i can count samsung kb standard , samsung swype kb , and android kb .
plus , the voice recognition works near flawlessly .
i can spit out five times the volume of texts , using better punctuation and more complete sentences -LRB- not sure if that 's a good thing in the end , this may be a pandora 's box -RRB- .
the kb flips depending on how you hold it , just like with the iphone .
the vibrate feedback is a nice touch .
what else ok , a few areas for improvement .
first , it would be nice to have a cradle option with external contacts on the phone that did not require plugging in a physical usb , like the blackberry devices have .
second , the screen , though lovely , is prone to smudges .
but you will get over it this is a device meant to be handled , so just wipe it down every once in awhile updated .
on aug 28 , 2010 .
this is the best alternative to the iphone on at t if the iphone is not for you or you or bored with it this is the phone for you .
it amazes me how clear , bright and large the touch screen is .
if you are looking for something better and more efficient than the iphone , then this phone is for you .
i can not tell you how much i have enjoyed my iphone , but when i researched this phone , i is intrigued .
it is time for me to get a phone upgrade and when i saw one of these phones that a co worker had just bought , i is hooked .
i can not believe i would ever say i like a phone better than my iphone , but this one is it .
the speed of this phone and the touch screen is better than i have ever seen .
i can honestly say , the iphone has some serious competition .
this phone is new , but when people start seeing what it will do and how good it looks , they wo not be able to keep these on the shelf .
i must be honest , i have never liked samsung phones before , so needless to say , i is leary .
but now that i own this one , i will never go back to my iphone .
this phone is awesome and if you are looking for a phone that is more high tech than the iphone , you do not have to look any farther .
this is the real competition .
now , i 'm going to get off of here so i can go back to playing with my phone .
i can not put it down .
this is about as good as it gets for a smartphone .
the evo has a 4 .
3 display , but is a bit too big to be pocketable .
this has a much bigger display than iphone 4 -LRB- size is more important than pixels at these sizes -RRB- but fits it in the same volume shell -LRB- a bit shorter , wider , same thickness -RRB- .
screen size is critical to me for typing and swype is a phenomenal typing speedup tool -LRB- and makes it more fun it continually amazes me how quickly i can enter words and swype still gets it right -RRB- .
great picture gallery app but at t hides it and decent music player and video player as it promotes it 's old school junk by default spent some time removing at t apps and putting shortcuts to these and other useful apps on the various screens .
i know all touch phones these days have dropped the physical answer call button , but i wish it had that it is a bit tough to see the on screen answer button and slide across after removing from my pocket when outside in bright sunlight -LRB- but at least this phone has options , home , up , and search buttons to replace the iphone 's single home button -RRB- .
also , coming from a windows mobile 6 .
1 lg incite with spb mobile , i wish i could get more information on a single home screen -LRB- a better calendar widget would do the trick -RRB- , and wish the alerts bar on the top would allow you to select things i see skype on other android 2 .
1 devices so hope it makes it here soon , and also hope to get wifi or bt tethering to laptops soon .
i 'm extremely picky , and so far love this phone in most ways .
i have had a great time using the samsung captivate .
i finally have a phone that i can customize .
i is so limited with the iphone , and i had it jailbroken too .
this is like a faster bigger jailbroken iphone that does not crash programs .
i love being able to speak to the phone and it can figure out what i am saying .
i also love the swype feature .
it saves so much time .
go get this phone if you are on the fence and stuck with at t .
return your iphone 4 and get the captivate .
the display is amazing .
i compared it with iphone and the retina display although better for tiny fonts which i can not read anyways , is not that different otherwise .
it even works in outdoor light .
the camera is good , and although it lacks flash which i never used on my previous phone , the night mode takes amazing pictures .
google voice app save me money on texting .
gmail integration is nice .
i found the navigation to be easy .
the video recording is nice and i can connect it directly to my tv to play it .
swype is really cool once you start using it i think this phone stands out from the other smartphones in the market .
i like to have phones that are good and are newer .
keeps it exciting , rather than having the same interface from upgrade to upgrade .
i had decided to try it for 2 weeks and i am keeping it .
i really can not praise this phone enough .
i is a very long time iphone 3g user and is planning on getting an iphone 4 , but i 'm not willing to shell out $ 200 for a phone that does n't do it 's basic function .
since my 3g stopped functioning once i put ios4 on it -LRB- and apple will make it as difficult as possible to downgrade software -RRB- , i decided to make the switch to android and i could n't be happier .
almost everything is customizable on the phone , which is great .
i know at t does n't let you download third party apps , but to be honest , the android market will fulfill all your needs the display is beautiful , all the videos i watch look stunning .
i thought it is going to be a little too big , but it 's actually the perfect size .
it fits nicely in your hand -LRB- and there is no death grip , believe me i tried very hard .
d -RRB- , and , as a female , i appreciate that i can slide it in and out of my pocket easily .
the phone is super fast and responsive , i rarely have trouble with it freezing or anything like that .
the camera takes great pictures , almost better than my actual camera .
it 's also really easy to take off the back to mount an sd card , check your battery etc .
i honestly can not say enough about how much i 'm enjoying this phone i do have a few small complaints , but all of them are tolerable issues , nothing major .
the four hom/back/menu buttons on the bottom need to be hit pretty specifically , which is kind of annoying but never a real problem 2 .
the charger goes in the top , which is annoying if you want to talk on the phone while charging , but i 'll live 3 .
occasionally -LRB- abour 3 or 4 times since i 've bought the phone 2 weeks ago -RRB- the screen will not go black fast enough when i put it against my ear to make a phone call and the mute button has been hit .
easily rectifiable , not a huge deal i highly recommend this phone if you 're an at t smartphone user who does n't want an iphone -LRB- though the aria is good too if you do n't need an excessively powerful phone -RRB- .
but either way , i could not be more satisfied .
coming from most recently an iphone 3gs , these area few areas that were an improvement really good high resolution screen , call sound quality is great , people can actually understand me i also purchased this phone for my wife , it 's her first smartphone .
she not to technical but really enjoys it and does not find it hard to use at all apps for android os leaves a lot to be desired .
i use my 3gs as an ipod now so i still have all the apps i purchased/downloaded .
a lot of apps on android have this win98 feel to them .
the only app that i use , that i feel is better on the android than it 's iphone counterpart would be twitter i 've never had issues with at t service and find their service is be really good in southern and central california .
since my data plan is grandfathered in , i still retain unlimited data at $ 30/month i 've found the build quality to be a little suspect , my screen is extremely blue compared to my wife 's phone at the same brightness settings .
my wife 's phone developed a rattle within two days of usage .
so we exchange both phones and so far the new pair seems to be ok overall i love the phone and would recommend anyone who hates apple or just wants to get away and try something new to get the captivate .
1st time in a long time that a phone said take me home .
when my windows phone crashed over a 1 .
5 years ago and i need a new phone .
iphone did not appeal to me and neither did the blackberry bold .
but i went with bb bold .
when i saw the captivate .
i is ready to ditch my bb on the spot .
the quickness of the phone and clarity of the screen blew me away .
the email is superb and i can see graphics in the email .
i can not say enough about this phone and i still learning new things about it .
imo this phone is definitely a winner .
long time iphone user wanted to try something diferent .
i can say i am not dissapointed , in fact can not beleive what i have been missing .
the only issue i had is finding samsungs kies software after i found it on the web syncing contacts , music videos and pictures are a breeze .
it also comes with a video converter to take advantage of that beautiful screen .
i would highly recommend this product to anyone tired of the iphone .
this phone rocks .
this is of course just all my opinion , but here it goes .
this phone is a must have .
why would anyone want an iphone 4 instead of this as this is pretty much open source and has very similar features .
i personally do not get the love affair with apple .
my wife has an iphone 3gs and my galaxy is a way better device .
also , apple dropped the ball on the iphone 4 and offers a free case to make device work properly .
how about recalling the device and fixing it .
if i bought the device and is later told that i will be given a free case to make it work , i would return it to the store .
in the past , there were limited alternatives , but samsung and google have produced a winner .
i have had a treo , two blackberrys and use my wife 's iphone and it is no contest this is the best handset/pda i have ever seen and used .
this is a grandslam .
even though the flash , fm radio and forward facing camera have been disabled , this is still a winner .
please read this if for some reason your battery appears to not be holding a charge , you may just have a bad battery .
this is the case with me .
swapped out the phone and battery lasts a long time .
also , download for free from the android apps market apps killer it will save your battery life a lot .
the screen is very bright and clear , there is a separate earphone jack with a good earphones and a mic -LRB- not tested yet -RRB- , including ear comfort pieces for the earphones , a nice touch .
apps are easy to get , there are things that take time to discover on this phone every day , which makes it a very clever phone that is not an iphone , especially coming from att .
there is also a slide cover over the usb port after you are done charging , for normal use , so nothing comes into it , a well thought out feature i did not have with my htc pure .
you have to make sure you learn to set the alarm clock , as it can be a bit confusing , along with grouping your pictures and so on .
the phone fits in your shirt pocket , it just sticks out just a little bit , but the phone is very lightweight so it is not cumbersome to keep it there .
most of my friends like it and want to get one , too .
i is so excited that samsung realesed their galaxy s phones the time that they did .
i is up for an upgrade from my crappy samsung eternity and almost bought an iphone 4 i had been always been proud of the fact that i have never owned an iphone .
i tried my best to get around it but i almost could n't because the iphone is at t 's best phone .
-LRB- not to mention i hate everything apple -RRB- for months , i have been very intrigued by samsung 's new line of phones called the galaxy s .
weeks before my upgrade , i keep reading that at t 's version of the galaxy s is hitting the day before my upgrade date .
i is so excited .
this is seriously the best phone i have ever gotten .
you can customize everything on this phone .
it runs android 2 .
1 and it is not locked down like the ios .
it is literally a pc in your hand .
the google voice search is amazingly accurate .
samsung 's super amoled screen makes colors stand out .
it 's something you have to see for yourself to tell the difference .
the battery life is really good especially if you put the advanced task killer on the phone that kills programs running in the background .
i highly recommend you download that app because you will be amazed on how many at t bloatware opens up when you turn on your phone and there is no way to delete them off the phone i would gripe about the phone not having flash and a front facing camera but i wo n't .
i have lived this long without either of those features and could n't care less about them .
-LRB- not to mention that it has nightmode for the camera and that works just as good and sometimes better than a flash .
if you do not want to be a tool like everyone else who has an iphone , the samsung captivate is the alternative of the iphone 4 .
not only is the captivate faster than the iphone 4 now , once android 2 .
2 froyo hits this sucker , there will be not contest between the phones .
ios 4 will be obsolete in a couple of months .
buy this phone .
just an awesome smart phone .
i 've been researching a new phone since the iphone 4 came out .
i could n't decide between the iphone 4 , blackberry bold , or the htc aria .
then last week the captivate came out and solved all my problems .
it is basically everything i loved about the iphone without the reception problems .
there are so many cool features on this phone that i keep finding .
my husband just bought the new iphone 4 and is jealous .
i love telling him all the things my phone does that his does n't , but he 's a big gamer and would n't change phones because of the fewer apps available .
the iphone camera is better , but i do not care because i always have my canon in my purse .
if you 're on the fence at all about whether to buy the new iphone , take an honest look at the samsung captivate and you 'll be happy you did .
i am so glad that i changed from the iphone to the captivate .
can not wait for the android 2 .
2 update .
better than the iphone by far .
best phone for at t .
i got this phone after having the htc aria for 2 weeks .
except for the fact that they are both android phones , there is no comparison .
it is well worth the additional $ 70 to move up from a mid range to high end droid .
my husband says the call quality when i talk to him on it is excellent .
bottom line is this is an awesome phone packed with all the features .
i have had every iphone from 2g to 3gs , i have an ipad , i have an imac , and i honestly can say i prefer this phone over the iphones .
including the 4g but i never owned the 4g .
i had it on order but canceled it .
this phone just blew it away in my opinion .
i 'm still an apple guy , just have to say this phone to me is the choice .
if your not on at t i would still recommend whichever iteration of the galaxy s line your provider carries .
it 's that nice , period .
i even like the touchwhiz ui from samsung .
awesome phone , 5 stars .
this phone rules the world .
i never saw like this phone before .
go buy one right now .
android is for techies .
you need to root this phone and flash custom roms to unlock its potential .
n00bs should just get an iphone .
this phone is absolutely amazing .
the huge screen , texting , and pretty much everything .
great phone its a iphone killer if you are suck of apple like i is i would defiantly get this phone .
i researched phones for several months when i decided it is time to upgrade .
i am a mac person and looked closely at the iphone 4 .
the app options is appealing , but the overall design of the iphone felt clunky to me compared to the feel of the captivate .
i also checked out the sony ericsson xperia 10 -LRB- i am a huge ericsson phone fan -RRB- but changed my mind after the delayed upgrade from 1 .
6 to 2 .
1 the screen on the captivate is simply beautiful and when i compared it to the iphone , i found in a lot of instances that it is better .
response time did not show any significant difference between the two and while i like the great app store available through apple , i simply could not get past how boxy the iphone looked and felt when i held both phones in my hands i have now had the captivate for about a month and i could not be more pleased .
the speaker is the best i have come across on a mobile .
it is very loud and clear .
this is an important feature for me since i use speakerphone often in the car or when i am on the move in the house .
the reception using speakerphone is also very clear for the person on the other end my only gripe is the lack of documentation that comes with the captivate .
most things you can figure out on your own , but i have had to look online for help with some syncing features or to figure out how to combine all of my contact information for individuals under one entry following the migration from my old phone i love the music player that is on this phone .
i use an app that allows me to sync my itunes library and for the first time i think my ipod may be replaced .
sorry apple , but i still love you considering i am a macbook devotee this phone does everything i need .
easy wifi connectivity for when i want to catch up on the news during lunch , great calendar syncing functions with gmail and my work calendar -LRB- which is of absolute necessity with my job -RRB- and fun games along with very easy interfacing with facebook which keeps me in touch with family and friends i agree with others .
i would like to have the option to remove some of the useless apps that at t placed on the phone .
still , no biggie .
great device as a blackberry replacement , larger , brighter screen .
i purchased mine at tigerdirect , an online vendor , and the upgrade cost is significantly less than normal retail .
i 've been searching for the perfect smart phone for months , and i 've been thinking that i have too high of expectations .
at one point i owned in htc evo , and i must say that the samsumg galaxy series phones are much better than htc .
i 'm finally satisfied with a phone purchase .
note that there are gps issues , but there is a software update that improves the gps functionality a ton .
it 's still a little slow when establishing a connection , but it updates moderately well once connected .
unboxing the phone , it comes with your standard safety packets , usb charger cable , hands free ear buds which are very nice actually , aside from that it is standard .
powering the phone you get the at t world phone animation with the galaxy s logo showing off some of the super amoled screens muscles .
you are then taken to the home page , unlike most android phone which scare the same hardware , samsung decided to outfit the captivate with their touchwiz 3 .
0 interface .
if you do not like touchwiz you are able to change the phones theme to suit your needs/wants better .
you also have samsung and android widgets that are useful and also not .
samsung has also made their own keyboard with swype but like the theme of the phone you can change it to the standard android formate .
lets take a shift now and go over the 5mp camera .
under light there are no complaints this is with both taking pictures and shooting video .
under low lighting it looks cheap .
i believe a flash would have made this phone a killer but because there is none the playing field is still somewhat even with other similar devices .
i wo not go too much into detail about all of the ins and outs of this phone but there are plenty .
to keep it short the phone is fast , light , thin , visually epic with many great aspects and few downers , i suggest to test one out at your local retailer to decide , as for me i love the phone .
first off i have an i phone and a samsung captivate , .
i love the samsung captivate , the screan is brilliant , video quality i great , intergration to social networks , customisable home screans , updates from friends is very nice feature especially since i work 2 jobsl .
i first saw my coworker playin with his new captivate and i just loved the large screan and how brilliant it was , how he wizzed thru the phone is so fast , into picture , to videos , u tube , into his gps , google maps after that i is sold i have had minor issues with texting but att soon resolved this issue thru a new sim card and reseting factory defaults sharing with this phone with my friends and relative working 2 jobs is not much of a chore any more , from picture , videos , keeping in contact , recieving updates and whats going on with family and friends has been so easy , further more updates on the weather and locale and world news is something i 've come to enjoy during lunch break i have a tom tom gps system i use for delivering pizza and i use this phone gps system and i have had any problems with the gps system locking on as other have reported at least with gps locking or keeping locked , further more i have found this system much more accurate than my tom tom which is pretty good but lacked updates for new roads and contruction and the automatic traffic update and rerouting is flawless .
there meany times i 've used both tom tom and my phones gps and found it to be more accurate texting somthing i have never been fast with but with this phone and various texting opton from the full keyboard , 3 4 , both droid defauld and samsung , swyping text , handwriting , and my favorite speech reconition works very well expecially while driving once in a while the phone slows and turning off the phone to repower or turning off apps works great , battery life is a down but i found with different setting like any smart phone can increase this life .
some people reported dead batterys by noon and i 've found this can be true but check out some of the power save feature and i find a full days use without recharging .
i had a bb curve 8310 for 2 .
5 years .
i think i had a total of 10 minutes of problems and downtime in those 2 .
5 years so i is hesitant to stray from bb .
i had thought about an iphone -LRB- briefly -RRB- because so many family members have one , but i have no apple products because of how proprietary they are with everything and how expensive their stuff is .
then my bb finally started goofing up after i dropped it .
i needed a new phone .
started researching and saw this .
took a 15 minute look at the att store and then bought online .
i is sold by the apps and the features and the price .
seems to be as good if not better than an iphone .
i had to make some adjustments to make the switch as i is a long time outlook user -LRB- 10 years or better -RRB- .
contacts , calendar , notes , tasks .
i have found a way to redo just about everything on google in the past 3 weeks and i like it better and i have not had to make any sacrifices .
that is my experience .
yours may differ if you use feature of outlook in a way i do not .
overall i can not say enough good things about this phone .
it feels pretty solid so far .
i hope i can get the same type of quality service from this phone that i did from my bb .
i have close to 300 + contacts use the calendar everyday , text with friends and family as well as facebook , take pictures , video and use email .
it 's all fairly intuitive and while there is a suppose to be a big deal with third party apps , i have found everything i have wanted or needed to accomplish what i need to on the android market for free .
i understand why some might be upset if you are an app developer , but as i understand it there are ways to deal with it if you absolutely have to have some third party app .
for the average user i really do n't think it 's an issue my only complaint is the battery so far , but like i said , i find i can not put it down unless i am asleep .
in time i will stop poking around to see what i can do with it and just use it , but for now i am having too much fun discovering apps on it as for gps no it wo n't lock yet it puts me on the map in the right town and neighborhood and street within 100 yards or so give or take and sometimes it will lock on -LRB- like for runkeeper -RRB- and give me fairly accurate results .
i understand an update is currently being pushed to the phones as a download .
i will look forward to it .
not sure i want to forced search for an update through the menus i have read some horror stories overall , for three weeks i have been nothing but impressed about this phone .
can not wait for the gps fix and the froyo update .
i can not believe it could make anything faster or better , but supposedly it will .
until then i 'll recommend this phone as is to anyone unless your an absolute , demanding techno geek just got the screen film , rubberized case and car charger from buy .
com for like $ 12 .
00 including shipping .
perfect .
the file went on perfectly no bubbles can not tell it 's there .
the case is rubberized to protect it a little bit , the car charger helps keep the battery fresh in the car .
make sure the micro usb housing is not to big on the car charger or it wo not fit snugly into the receptacle on the phone if your looking for a feature rich phone with lots of apps , you will not be disappointed with this phone now let 's hope i can get 2 + years out of it .
great smart phone with a ton of features to customize .
feels really well build and the display is so crisp and clear color me impressed .
is going for the apple iphone 4 .
no more iphone 4 maybe when they come out with a version 2 .
@digital_dave -LRB- twitter -RRB- .
just a fantastic android phone that does more every day i use it .
i highly recommend the body glove -LRB- case , protector , whatever you call it -RRB- and a screen protector .
i highly discourage the $ 21 best buy invisishield garbage .
i found a great protector by a company called amzer -LRB- off of www .
fommy .
com -RRB- for very cheap , and maintains the smoothe feel of the original screen .
i dislike the rubbery , sticky ones that are out there .
this one is much more rigid and with a little care and patience , goes on completely invisible bottom line is ; be original .
think for yourself .
do not be an iphone sheep when there are fantastic phones like this out there .
all in all great phone .
one of the first things i did is to locate a user manual on line i really hated the fact that one did not come with the phone , but at least the quick start guide should have directed the owner to the correct samsung site -LRB- there must be about 10 of them just for the usa -RRB- .
one of the first things i encountered in the user manual -LRB- pdf format -RRB- is a reference to the samsung keis program that provides a number of useful functions .
unforunately , i is unable to locate the program on the samsung support site at that time -LRB- middle of august 2010 -RRB- .
i eventually found it on the india samsung site -LRB- since that time , it has mysteriously appeared on a couple of the usa samsung sites , so here 's one for the support site http / / www .
samsung .
com/ae/consumer / mobile phones/mobile phones/infotainment/gt i9000hkdxsg/index .
idx .
pagetype prd _ detail tab support -RRB- .
samsung could have made this easier .
m still learning about the phone its capabilities -LRB- probably will be for some time to come -RRB- , so i .
m not much help in that regard yet .
all i can say is that it .
s a major change from my old -LRB- . -RRB-
razr .
i sit next to two iphone 4 users at work and i think they 're jealous of my new captivate .
now , we all sit around whispering my precious to our phones .
had the iphone 4g for a few days but could not get into it .
this phone is much better all the way around .
i 'm extremely happy with this phone .
when the iphone first came out , i really wanted to get it , but it is cost prohibitive and , since i is just moving up from the razr , i did n't think i 'd need to do much of the stuff that the iphone did .
i decided to go cheaper with the lg xenon which is nice because it had the touchscreen and qwerty keyboard .
i did n't really want to use the touchscreen to type because i liked to actually have the physical buttons to type with .
unfortunately , the xenon 's touchscreen left a lot to be desired .
it was not very smooth or responsive and looking at web pages on the smaller screen is cumbersome .
then i got the blackberry curve from my work .
no touchscreen of course , but i loved all the available apps and reading and navigating websites is way better than on the xenon .
getting hooked on the blackberry , i figured it is time for an upgrade for my personal phone because i is using my blackberry for so much more than just work functions .
plus after seeing the iphone in action from my brother and brother in law , i knew it is time for an upgrade .
of course i strongly considered getting the iphone .
another option is the blackberry storm because it had the touchscreen/qwerty keyboard combo and i is already happy with my curve .
but from what i read on cnet and what the guy at the at t store told me , i is better off going with the captivate i 'm very happy that i did .
i can not compare it head to head with the iphone because i 've only seen the iphone a few times , but the quality of the captivate has been really impressive thus far .
the one thing i do know is that the captivate has over the iphone is the phone quality with regard to signal strength and dropped calls .
and since that 's the main reason i have a cell phone or at least it used to be that is a major plus there .
it already comes loaded with tons of apps .
and i can go to the android store and find tons more games and apps .
with the size of the screen and the vibrant colors , reading websites is so nice and the apps are really powerful .
the touchscreen is very responsive and although i was not familiar with doing all the swiping to navigate everywhere , i 'm getting used to it really quick .
there are seven home page screens that i can customize with various widgets and favorite apps and games .
that makes it easy to stay organized with all the different things i want to do .
and as far as not having a qwerty keyboard goes , it would be a nice thing to have , but i 'm really not missing it .
when i have the phone in landscape mode , the keyboard is significantly larger than the xenon or curve , so it 's actually easier to type anyway .
plus i do n't necessarily even have to type .
for one , the speech to text technology is very accurate .
i only tried it a couple times , but it is 100 % accurate with what i said .
and while i have n't really tried the swype typing , i saw it demo 'd and that blows away normal typing with a keyboard any day as well my one complaint is that i was not able to set up my emails on their email app .
for some reason , it did n't recognize my login and password for either account .
i did download the yahoo .
mail app which is really nice , but like it 's website counterpart , you can only be logged into one email account at a time .
you 'd think by now they would be able to let you log into two or more of your accounts simultaneously without having to logout and log back in .
comcast has been allowing you to do this for years as long as the emails are under the same main account .
i may still figure the captivate email out eventually , but even if i do not , this is a very small complaint i can probably give a more thorough review of the phone in a few weeks after i 've used it more and learn more about all the things it does .
but i know enough about it now , that i really love this phone and i 'm extremely happy with the choice i made to buy it .
the blackberry made my xenon obsolete and now the captivate is making my curve obsolete although i still need it for work .
by far , best phone i have ever had .
my iphone friends are jealous of apps they do not have and the better integration of google apps .
if it was not for this phone i would have left at t to get a smart phone from other carriers .
my wife loves the phone and wants to get one too .
i 've had this phone for 3 days now and i 'm quite happy with it .
thanks to some googling i is able to get the phone rooted and got rid of at t 's silly restrictions .
also the phone can be found on amazon for 1 penny .
bottom line great phone , bad and greedy phone provider .
although you can easily root your phone to side load any applications you want plus it has flash and adobe .
i have read individual reviews of some of the major problems people have had with the captivate , with the gps , with the media player , the battery life , etc i have not had any of these .
from the box , all of my features have performed at or above the expected level .
if you are upgrading , go to amazon wireless , it 's better price on 2 yr contract than at the att stores .
the samsung captivare -LRB- galaxy s -RRB- is a great alternative to the iphone 4 .
though the screen does not as a high a pixel density as apple 's retina display , the black levels , contrast , and color accuracy more than make up for it .
the fact that the user can add a 32gb micro sdhc card is a huge plus .
with it , one could add several full length 720p movies with 6 channel surround sound -LRB- in ac3 and aac lc or what samsung calls aac + , though aac he , aka eaac + , is limited to 2 channels only -RRB- .
the phone has support for several audio and video formats though drm 'd videos from zune , itunes and amazon vod do not work .
only phone on the market that can playback divx hd .
did i mention the awesome screen .
it is truly something to be seen in person .
i is using the htc fuze before i got this phone .
it is like night and day .
i really did love the keyboard on the fuze , but do not miss it at all .
i though i would never like a phone with a actual keyboard , but this phone changed my mind .
i is really disappointed in the selection of phones att had to choose from , until this phone came out .
it is like they only really cared about the iphone and nothing else .
i have never wanted an iphone and i have used it before .
nothing against anyone else , but it is just never my cup of tea .
this to me is the best phone att has to offer at the moment .
i is really waiting on there first windows phone 7 phone before i got a new one but things happend and i didnt have a choice .
i am glad now .
leave your email if you want me to send you a full tutorial in sideloading your apps .
all galaxy s variants are reported by samsung to have .

i have owned the captivate for one week now .
two weeks ago i bought a vibrant , the sister phone through t mobile but had no service in or around my home for a half mile .
the two are comparable but they are great phones whichever choice .
i have scoured the internet reading about phones before and after my purchase and have come up with a few conclusions .
1 -RRB- android is fast becoming the phone os of choice , 2 -RRB- htc , samsung and apple have the market and 3 -RRB- android phones offer bells and whistles that cost extra on the iphone a flash .
don .
t really need it one thing that has several people posting negatives on this phone is the lack of flash .
well , in some cases that may be a problem .
consider though that these little led flashes do not throw off much past three feet anyway .
on the xda forums they demonstrate this phones capability in night shot and it si fantastic .
the entire field is lit up on a pic at 9 30 at night .
i tested it and found that it works well except in situations where a light source casts light in a darker room .
this the picture comes out dark .
-LRB- something like a lamp in the background -RRB- another usual concern is the front camera .
i looked at the evo 4g and the iphone .
since i did not have a contract with anyone i is able to really shop .
this feature is not that important to me so i did not make it a point for purchase the galaxy phones are very lightweight .
my friend has an htc evo 4g and it is heavy compared to this phone .
it is a nice phone too but the galaxy s phones have the latest in technology fastest cpu , excellent gpu , bluetooth 3 .
0 , the best screens -LRB- not the evo lcd but samoled -RRB- , etc .
they are hard to beat .
i also shopped the iphone .
it is a beautiful phone but limited in screen customizing , and dialog boxes that interrupt when using if a call or text comes in .
plus the screen is smaller this coming from a heavy apple user with five macs and a mobile me account .
i still chose the best product .
imo .
i hope this helps you to make the best choice .
there a many features on these phones that are just being discovered so be aware of that when reading reviews .
one review i read really bashed samsung for putting out a phone with rca out for hookup to legacy devices , etc .
stating how behind they were not realizing the many options .
well , the stereo bluetooth 3 .
0 -LRB- not 2 .
0 or 2 .
1 found on others -RRB- , dlna communication and usb/hdmi cable takes the phone to new levels of connectivity .
i is convinced i had to have a physical qwerty keyboard but after using swipe and android .
s free speech to text , i have no need for pushing some tiny little keys .
all this and just think , android .
s new update froyo 2 .
2 is due out soon to only make these even better and faster .
i can not imagine someone unhappy with one of these phones updated .
on aug 6 , 2010 .
i 'm new to smartphones , so i may just be excited at everything this phone can do sompared to my 3 year old sony ericsson .
but my wife has had an iphone 3gs for 2 years , and i would say the captivate compares very favorably first off , i really like the design of the phone .
it is very sleek and has a different profile from the other touchscreen phones .
it has a large screen , but is very thin and has a solid feel in the hand speaking of the screen it is , in a word , brilliant .
colors are bright and vivid , and graphics on games are truly amazing .
video clips taken from the phone -LRB- hd -RRB- are very crisp phone quailty is also excellent .
i used to drop calls all the time with my old phone while driving , but i have n't had that issue in the 2 weeks that i have had this phone .
bluetooth works flawlessly with my car .
the processor is very fast , and i have not experenced any lag to this point i have read many complaints reagarding email , and with my yahoo acount , i have found that i can not send email over wi fi .
i believe this is the result of an agreement between at t and yahoo , but i can receive email over wi fi .
there is also a yahoo mail app that may solve that problem i love the swype keyboard .
i suppose the only real drawback is the lack of a flash for the camera , but if the tradeoff is making it as sleek as it is , i 'm alright with that .
if you need a flash , this is obviously not the phone for you at the end of the day , it 's a great phone .
if you need a flash or you need an apple , then you wo not like it .
otherwise , you owe it to yourself to take a long look at the captivate .
the samsung captivate really catches your eyes .
when the at t representative came out of the stockroom with the box , it is immediately apparent that they took some time with this phone .
the os is refined and very well made .
i did n't think that i would ever love a phone as much as i loved my iphone 3g -LRB- before 4 .
0 update -RRB- , but being a proud captivate owner really surprised me .
it has features with features and layers that i do not know if i will ever see .
with multiple home screens and a layout just for the apps , this customizable phone just keeps getting better .
fast , well that is an understatement .
i had one bar of service in the rural area that i live in and still could surf the internet faster that i could on 3g there is almost no lag time in the os and you can have multiple apps running at the same time .
this also requires a download that should come stock on the phone .
you must get an application called task manager -LRB- many options exist -RRB- to save your battery life and end the tasks that you are not using anymore this phone is customizable to the extreme .
the lack of flash and front facing camera is not that important to me .
i get along without .
also the fact that it takes some time to load on a mac is true .
however on samsung 's website i found some great tips from questions that were already asked by users this phone will blow your mind with the beautiful amoled and features .
if you are in a position where you do not want to go back to iphone , go for captivate and really see what galaxy s has to offer you .
this phone is amazing .
it 's not only the best android at t offers , it may be the best android on the market .
hopefully they get the gps issue rectified with the rumored firmware update .
other than that , this thing is just about perfect .
if only at t performed as good as the phone .
while traveling , i needed to replace my aging at t blackberry 8310 , therefore could n't wait for an iphone 4 -LRB- ya ' hearing me apple . -RRB-
and had an android curiosity .
could have switched carriers right then and there but popped into a boston at t store where they had just received this phone idea is to try it for 30 days , at which point apple would have iphones stocked and i would switch if needed .
two problems ; i do not think the iphone will be readily available , and i might be falling in love i 've had the captivate for 2 weeks and it just keeps getting better .
it 's ridiculously fun to play with and the biggest obstacle for me is all my mac , mobileme stuff , particularly ical .
i have considered using google as my primary calendar but going down that road could lead me straight -LRB- god forbid -RRB- into a pc all of that just to accommodate a cell phone any suggestions before i destroy my life .
missing sync perhaps .
that just sounds half baked to me bottom line , the samsung captivate -LRB- so far -RRB- seems to be a serious contender against any device , and by far at t 's best android offering .
it 's a fun and impressive phone that works well as a phone great as a place finder so far so good as a gps navigator .
yes it needs to be charged but it 's worth it .
love this phone because it 's functionality is almost elite with i phone .
call quality , slim , 4 in .
display , fast responsive and just sexy .
upgrade the micro sd card , even faster .
can not go a minute w/o playing with it .
android 2 .
2 coming , heard it will make it even faster more powerful .
can view screen outside .
camera does not have flash but comes with a lot of settings to try and compensate bought mine w/o contract $ 350 , what .
great phone , the shortcomings have been seen in other phones before so hopefully samsung will fix soon .
most shortcomings are minor irritants , and battery life is getting better .
also , complete control of the phone is very easy -LRB- compared to iphone -RRB- so quickly root and add apps as you need or remove at t bloatware .
touchwiz is pretty good , but it needs a little polish in some areas it is bearable , but hopefully we will see it updated as well before 2 .
2 nicer then iphone 4 imo , at least it is not glass on 2 sides and feels good in my hand .
iam in love with my new phone , no regrets to switch to android , i used ti have sync issues but i manage to find a solution and i found some extra features like thetering , jajajajjaja , yeahhhh , baby this phone rocks .
the best choice for anyone on at t looking for an android phone .
i feel that it definitely serves as a competitor for the iphone 4 .
definitely worth a look and a buy , pick one up and try it out .
i love this phone .
i switched from an iphone 3gs to the captivate and i have no regrets .
after playing with the iphone 4 in the apple store and seeing how , to me , the new iphone is nothing really new , i decided to get the captivate seeing how it 's at t 's only good android phone i am ecstatic over this phone .
t 's a fantastic iphone alternative .
it 's blazing fast , has a beautiful display with a large screen , it 's thin and light weight , and it has pretty decent battery life with even heavy use .
if you 've owned an iphone and are bored with it -LRB- like i was -RRB- then this is a great alternative .
no let downs at all .
android 2 .
2 froyo should rid of some of the app switching delay and also improve battery life slightly .
all in all a tremendous phone that is easy to use with functions that will make iphone owners jealous .
some of the little things on the phone will make you think , darn , that is cool .
the pros definitely outweigh the cons -LRB- which do not significantly hurt the overall experience -RRB- .
if you 're sick and tired of the iphone and want something that is right on par with it , then this is definitely the phone for you .
what can i say .
i am generally pleased by this phone .
this will be my first smartphone and its living up to what everyone is saying in regards to the captivate .
for starters , its design and weight is very appealing .
lightweight and for it 's size , it fits pretty nice in my pocket despite my initial impression on that particular matter the next thing i noticed is that the speaker and clarity of the phonecalls are loud and clear .
much better than the last two phones i had -LRB- a samsung go phone and a sony ericcson w44s from au in japan -RRB- .
i is surprised to hear how clear my music is playing through the speakers now i always never is a fan of the phone camera always had ugly , distorted pics so it is better for me to just have my camera on me for those omg moments -LRB- i 'm a sucker for exposing that -RRB- with this camera , i can say goodbye to carrying my camera .
finally , a real camera -LRB- or at least relevant -RRB- .
very impressive and clear on par with the iphone 4 with its 5 megapixel image and 720p video recording there is something i did notice about this phone which is not surprising to see .
the infamous death grip that has seen so much attention with the iphone from the media it 's very apparent with the captivate .
not a real issue for me because i do n't hold the phone like i hold a gun as i 'm you is the same for all of you but just an fyi that this phone is subject to signal lost if applying said death grip and it 's only about a 2 bar loss .
i 'm assuming that this is nothing new -LRB- considering this is my first smartphone -RRB- so it ai n't as much as a big deal as what the media is portraying the iphone 4 's antenna issue another thing that i need to get used to is how sensitive the screen is to touch i 'm always hitting random buttons or launching apps when i do not mean to overall , i 'm very impressed and pleased with this phone .
to me , the smartphone and android is living up to what people have been saying .
i am a believer .
this phone is a little tricky to get use too .
if your not tech savy this might not work for you .
it has all the features of an iphone and then some .
been messing around with this for a day and still have many more things to figure out .
great phone i love it .
i know this comes down to iphone 4 vs .
samsung captivate so here we go .
in my opinion , this phone is superior to the iphone in terms of software .
in the long run smart phones come down to the software .
so while you may not have that front facing camera or flash , you have a phone that can do things better than the iphone on the inside .
the screen is beautiful and larger than the iphone 's screen , but still small enough to fit in your pocket , and small enough to not look like a brick samsung adds a sexy charm to the android system , making its entire app folder look similar to how you go through apps on the iphone with a grid .
the home screen lets you use widgets .
unlike the iphone that says it can multitask , but actually has fast app switching , this phone does multitask if you are fond of google calendar , gmail , reader , gchat , and social network integration this phone is for you .
you will not be disappointed .
i had been using iphones since 2008 , and i can tell you that the samsung captivate has an overall better experience .
really the only thing the iphone has on it is a front facing camera and flash , and in long run , those things do not matter unless you are dead set on video chat , but how many other people do you know in your friends that will have the same phone who will be available at the same time to stare at each other over a wifi network .
i highly recommend this phone .
this is my first android phone .
thank you at t for giving me a real choice .
i highly recommend this phone .
and i discovered a solution to my concern about converting my entire itunes library to mp3 format .
i discovered cloud storage .
i also love swipe text .
it 's really fast .
i love this phone .
this is my first experience owning a smart phone , that being said , i 'm not new to technology .
i have to say that this phone is quite immpressive .
i originally is going to go with an iphone , however , i just could n't feel good about it .
maybe because every tween and their mom has one .
maybe bad press .
maybe b/c i thought apple had we know what 's best for you attitude .
but i 'm straying .
i heard about the captivate , demoed one , and fell in love .
the huge amoled display is crystal clear and much larger than any other out there .
i found that the calls are clear and do an excellent job of filtering noise , however , occasionally you do have a digital sound to your voice .
however , keep in mind , you 're talking through a little computer basically .
i 've heard people say that they are upset by being limited to android apps .
i found that there were amazing apps in the android store , ranging anywhere from referance apps , games , ringtones/wallpapers , you name it .
the touch screen is very responsive and the phone -LRB- with its hummingbird processor -RRB- is lightening quick .
it has swype -LRB- a function that allows you to drag your finger across the keyboard for texts -RRB- which is surprisingly accurate .
i think one of the biggest pros is that , since it has such a large screen , everything is bigger .
this means if you have big fingers and find texting difficult on most touch screen phones , you should have no problem on this one .
the phone is surprisingly intuitive , in that , if you do not know where something is , there are usually multiple ways to find what you 're looking for .
that 's mostly thanks to android though .
overall , the only at t phone that can compete with this is the iphone 4 .
there are some areas where the iphone wins out -LRB- video chat , camera flash , etc -RRB- , but i 'm convinced -LRB- having had hands on both -RRB- that if you are looking for the better overall phone and multimedia device , you would be more happy with the captivate .
unless you 've already sold your soul to apple .
when i picked up this phone and saw it 's amoled screen light up , it is love at first sight .
i did n't realize how big this phone is until i saw it for myself .
i think it 's just the right size , just big enough to have a realistically touch friendly screen but small and definitely thin enough to fit in your pocket .
the iphone 4 's ips display is nice but it has nothing on an amoled screen .
amoled displays have superb color and they have perfect black levels due to that it shuts off pixels to show black the other benefit to this is that it consumes less power than a lcd screen .
the 1ghtz .
processors performance really shows on this device .
i could n't get this thing to lag no matter how hard i tried the interface is fluid and perfectly smooth and the screen is very responsive .
i swore up and down that i would not buy a phone without a physical keyboard but this phone convinced me otherwise .
the onscreen keyboard works great .
i found it easier to use than the iphone 's .
at first i thought swype would be an annoyance but it actually works great and does n't work when you do n't want it to .
i thought it would get easily confused but it gets what i am typing spot on .
i is very impressed with it .
it will however take a small learning curve to get fast with it .
the build quality of the phone is pretty solid yet lightweight .
it does n't feel cheap .
i dig the pseudo carbon fiber backplate -LRB- though i wish it is real -RRB- i also wish this phone would have brushed or anodized aluminum trim pieces instead of the chromed plastic .
brushed aluminum is way sexier and extremely durable .
i hate how people bash this phone for being ugly .
while looks are a subjective matter , people often do n't think out of the box as far as determining the look or sexiness of a device .
as an artist , i think this phone is very appealing to the eye and has a very attractive design i particularly like the curved top and bottom edge as opposed to flat .
i do not care for the iphone 's boring understated design that has not changed much over it 's evolution .
as far as battery life , call quality etc .
i can not judge that until i buy the phone this review is just my first thoughts of the phone and when i get it i will update the review accordingly .
best smartphone on the market , hands down .
needs a software update to tweak a few things like gps and the hardware nav button light timeout but other than that this thing is awesome .
i can not wait to see it rocking froyo .
the phone is a breath of fresh air compared to the iphone 3g .
the iphone is a great phone , but i do n't like how much apple locks it down -LRB- for most people that is not a big deal for some it is what makes the phone great and work -RRB- .
the screen is amazing , the quality of calls is nice , the functionality of email , messages , etc is right where it needed to be .
overall i would say that if you do not want to go down the apple our way only path this is a great alternative oh , and i love google voice .
let 's see you do that with an iphone .
great phone .
it 's that simple .
if you 're on at t and do not want an iphone , this is the phone to get .
this definitely the best android phone available for at t , so if you are looking for an iphone alternative this is the best one they have to offer design and hardware .
many people have described the captivate .
s design as lackluster especially when compared to it siblings such as the vibrant .
i must admit though , personally , i like the design of the captivate better .
although its edges are sharper and more box like , i think the phone has more of manly look and it looks nicer in person .
it measures 4 .
18 inches tall by 2 .
5 inches wide by .
39 inches deep .
it weighs 4 .
5 ounces which is a bit more then the vibrant which weighs 4 .
16 ounces .
we prefer this extra weight as it makes the phone feel much sturdier than the vibrant .
overall the phone is just a bit bigger than the iphone 4 , but much smaller then phones such as the evo 4g , droid x , or hd2 , so it .
s relatively pocket friendly software and features .
the captivate runs android 2 .
1 skinned with samsung .
s touchwiz 3 .
0 interface .
we must admit we have not been fans of the touch wiz interface in the past and often found it clunky and useless in comparison to htc .
s sense ui .
however 3 .
0 brings some great improvements to the interface , but it is still no match for sense .
samsung has added some new widgets such as feeds and updates which streams updates from all of the user .
s social networking sites .
the feature allows lists to be updated up to every 30 minutes , but it may be wise to lengthen the refresh rate in order to conserve battery performance .
the 5 mp camera on the captivate is a mixed bag .
if used outside or in great lighting conditions it produces fantastic pictures such as the one below on the left .
this picture could easily pass of as a photo taken with a point and shoot camera .
if the lighting conditions were poor the pictures were not very good to say the least -LRB- picture on the right -RRB- .
why there is no flash on this phone is puzzling .
on the upside , the features available when taking pictures are great .
they include auto focus , white balance , iso , and scence modes , effects , and adjustable exposure check out full review at link below .
thanks -RRB- .

com/2010/07 / 18/samsung captivate galaxy s review att / .
i have not tried the at t version of the galaxy s series .
i did try the t mobile version which is basically the same phone .
absolutly stunning screen .
i loaded up some gamaes , and watched some videos .
i also loved the status notification window the tweaks they did .
they left alot of the stock android and polished where it needed to be .
i think google should take there queue on the the ui for the next version of android from this phone .
i like this product a whole lot .
the combination of the super amoled screen with the snappy 1ghz processor makes for a very smooth user experience .
screens switch with a simple swipe of your finger and move seamlessly from one to another .
the live wallpapers make for a beautiful background , and from what i can tell do not use up a lot of your battery .
i love how the locking interface works to avoid errant key presses .
you have a button on the side of the phone you hit to lock it .
that turns off the screen .
when you press the button to unlock you still need to swipe across to fully unlock everything .
the proximity sensor works great as well it switches from portrait mode to landscape mode relatively quickly .
the facebook app sometimes will not switch over to landscape view when typing your but that is a problem with the app i do not like having to tap the screen when taking a picture .
i really wish there were a button on the side of the phone to snap the photo overall there are some minor quirks but honestly no phone is perfect .
it is a worthy alternative to the iphone and i believe it is the best android phone for at t right now highly recommended , especially for some of the low prices many places are offering right now .
i is extremely frustrated the first day .
i downloaded the weather channel app and the phone could not complete , so i had to reset and clear the cache .
after this , it worked great .
i know read the ny times , huffington post and the weather channel every nite on the couch instead of using my laptop .
so my message is the phone is fantastic , but be aware there are a ton of settings to play with .
you could spend all day customizing .
i have heard this from iphone users as well , my whole company has them , i am the boss and have this now for business it syncs my calender , contacts , and gmail live .
amazing .
so long blackberyy , loved you , found my new home as a business user here my number one complaint is battery life .
there is a app killer that controls expenditure on power , but i havnt had time to dl yet , for now it is charge every nite samsung website very , very helpful .
after reading several tutorials and watching some youtube videos this phone is now under my control .
it 's exciting to research the different android aps that are available and how to use them .
the only downfall is the extra cost to access tv .
they have to do more to make the extra cost worth it .
overall this phone is great as long as u download the task killer .
the pictures are amazing .
i have owned this phone since it is first released and for the most part i love it .
it could definitely use some better apps .
i 've lived with the captivate for a few weeks now and nearing the 30 day decision point of if it stays or if it goes .
the verdict it stays if anyone has found the perfect smartphone , let me know .
each has trade offs .
i had and still have the iphone 3gs .
i will be keeping it as a back up and to use it as an itouch , but i had grown a little tired of it as a phone .
the call quality is average , and it kept dropping my bluetooth headset during calls .
the iphone had just become a little ho hum i checked on some upgrade options and at t offered me a better deal for me to take the captivate vs .
the iphone 4g .
besides , my wife has the 4g and despite the nice cover apple sent , it still drops calls .
so , i decided to give the droid a shot which is tough for a self proclaimed apple fan .
let 's walk through a few key areas to see how the captivate compares email .
the base email app on the captivate is the pits when compared to the iphone .
apple has done a much better job integrating with exchange servers and has better email functionality .
the captivate does survive as a basic email device .
you can not file email like on the iphone , but you can receive and reply to email just fine .
so , the captivate is functional but it does not excel .
i have an ipad , so i did n't consider the loss in email functionality to be a huge deal as the captivate will suffice for phone based email calendar .
i wish there is better support for setting up a meeting and inviting attendees .
it really does n't work too well on the captivate .
you have to forward the meeting as an attachment .
hopefully there will be some improvements in the upcoming versions of android .
again , the functionality is sufficient and the exchange sync support is acceptable .
but like email , it 's not an area where the captivate excels call quality .
this is one of the areas that tipped the scale in favor of keeping the captivate .
the call quality is definitely better than the iphone .
and in the end , the core purpose is for this to be a phone .
so , chaulk one up for the captivate apps .
there are a lot of options for free apps for the droid .
i think the quality and functionality of the free apps for the droid platform is slightly better than the iphone side .
but the droid market does stink .
it can be hard to find apps if you are just looking around for ideas , and i would n't score it high for being user friendly .
but once you know what to look for , there are some great free apps there .
in general , i would say that putting the problems of the droid market aside , the app support is on par with the iphone customization .
i 'm a fan of the live wallpaper .
i just like having something that is interesting to look at on the screen when using the phone .
the widgets and other options to customize the interface is better than the iphone .
this is another area that tipped the scales to keep the captivate gps .
i have n't had the same problems as others with the gps .
each time i have used it , it has worked fine .
the option of having turn by turn directions integrated with the map is outstanding .
i do travel some , so having this option is another item that tipped the scales .
that being said , the gps can be slow to sync .
the iphone is much faster there .
but you are looking at an app purchase of around $ 80 $ 90 for the garmin or magellan app or going another route where you have to purchase a subscription to get turn by turn battery life .
when i got the phone , i thought it is going to be a quick return .
the battery life is awful .
part of this goes back to the droid learning curve .
i downloaded a task killer app and shut down apps that i did not need running in the background .
i adjusted the screen brightness down to the lowest level -LRB- you can still see the screen just fine -RRB- , and ran the phone through a few charge and use cycles .
at this point , i would say that the battery life is on par or slightly better than the iphone 3gs .
one tip that i picked up is that you can switch the screen brightness by swiping the top menu bar .
so if i am outside and need to see better , just a quick swipe brings up the screen brightness and you can see the phone in sunlight just fine .
in the end , i can last the whole day with no problems now despite the shortcomings , there is enough to tip the scales to keeping the captivate .
one thing not mentioned that also came into play can be summed up with three words options , options , options .
i have a lot of options in how i can set up the phone when compared to the iphone .
if you are considering the droid platform for the first time , be prepared that there is a slight learning curve to discover the best way to get the most out of it for your situation .
once you get through the learning curve , it offers so many app options and customization options , it is actually a pretty exciting platform and phone .
i love the display and slightly bigger display .
i also think that the form factor fits the hand better .
i am glad i bought the captivate , and would recommend it to anyone , especially iphone owners .
you can sideload applications without rooting your phone .
http / / www .
androidcentral .
com/sideload android apps all you want sideload wonder machine .
completely legal .
this is a nice phone and it 's by far the best android phone i 've owned -LRB- of three total -RRB- .
a little disappointed that this phone has such a huge screen but it 's not being taken advantage of fully for video .
i understand that there are a million different android phones but the manufacturers should really pony up and get with the times to compete with apple .
i 'm tempted to return my phone for an iphone just so i can watch netflix and other streaming movies through itunes .
can not wait to see how this thing works with froyo .
at t did their best to screw this phone up and failed .
if you own one do some web surfing and learn how to root the phone and side load or -LRB- better choice -RRB- remove store only restrictions .
look on the at t part of the store and claim you free copy of quickoffice .
it rocks .
get the usb drivers and kies software .
if you remove the market only restriction get slideme and market access , you 'll be glad you did be unafraid , the phone responds to tweaks with faster performance and better options .
by the end of september froyo will be available .
once the galaxy tab ships , samsung will kick in with tons of first rate content music and video .
did i mention this phone plays divx movies .
and does so beautifully .
i returned my iphone for this and i think i used to be an apple fanboi but i have seen the light of open os and i do n't regret the switch at all .
i got the multimedia cables and despite not being hd the image on my flat screen looks great .
use titanium backup to remove whatever at t bloat ware you do not use -LRB- i kept the account management software -RRB- i think some of them ran in the background constantly , as i saw an immediate improvement .
use a task killer app judiciously all in all a great , stable system .
my neighbor has an evo really cool , but he already caved and had to buy a spare battery because he can not make it through one day without the spare -LRB- ok he is a salesman and uses the phone a lot , but even so -RRB- and the same 3d game on my phone is faster and smoother than his not really knocking the evo its cool , but i am not jealous at all .
nor do i miss the iphone that looses signal when i hold it in my left hand .
does everything an iphone does and more except you have to download lots of apps to get it there .
for example .
must download k9 email client app because the software that comes with the phone does not check for email at the frequency selected .
visual voicemail does not come with phone but you can download google voice and get it for free .
does not open pdf 's without downlaoding the free adobe reader app .
does not open microsoft word and excell attachments without downloading the free quick office app although once installed the app is awesome .
does not read or import standard contact or vcf files without once again downlaoding a free app .
does not play .
mov video files without downloading a free app .
bottom line the phone eventually does evrything the iphone does and more it just takes a little work and some patience .
in summary i would definetly recommend this phone just make sure you download these apps right away so you do not get frustrated like i did .
great smartphone does everything i need and i like the android os .
screen size and clarity is great and works outside pretty well in sunlight .
i am glad there is an alternative to the universe of jobs world .
awesome phone but poorly designed usb hookup makes it annoying to plug in to computer and charger .
i have had this about 3 weeks now and really love this android 2 .
1 phone .
i have had an apple 3g phone , blackberry curve , etc .
this is a great for people who want to use data and the internet on a phone .
great build quality , thin as but lighter than the iphone 4 .
worth checking out .
4 inch amoled is to die for .
i saw the movie avatar on the sprint vibrant version and it looked great .
kindle book reading works too .
i have been a hard core apple user for 2 years now when it comes to phones .
i got tired of my 3gs and chose the android instead of the iphone 4 .
i will not say that the captivate is better then the iphone 4 , for there are many things i like on both .
the music player is not bad on the captivate , but you can not beat the simplicity of having a iphone when it comes to music .
i did however find the browser a little faster in my opinion on the captivate .
also i love the 4 inch amoled display , which i think is almost as good as the retina display .
the android market i found has to my relief plenty and most of the apps i used on my iphone .
free turn by turn directions is awesome .
but sometimes it takes a little while to find the gps , and it doesnt seem to work so well when i have a case on the phone .
one of the things i like most is how little i actually have to type on the keyboard .
google voice is very accurate and you can talk to text as well , which is great for driving overall i am pleased with my phone , and i am glad i switched .
back in november , i became eligible for a new phone with at t .
i started researching at that point , and continued throughout the early months of 2010 .
as summer approached , i had two potential choices the dell streak , and the samsung captivate .
both android devices , though that is where the similarity ends .
when dell continued to delay the launch of the streak in the us , i elected to go with the captivate let me be clear i love this phone .
it 's lightweight while still feeling substantial , and the materials and finishing make it look every bit the cutting edge device that it is .
at the time i write this , it 's running the android os called eclair -LRB- 2 .
1 -RRB- , but reports have indicated that the next version -LRB- 2 .
2 froyo -RRB- will be available soon .
this phone does have a few quirks , and many can be attributed to this operating system choice .
the most annoying of these is no doubt the memory usage the operating system is unable to utilize the full amount of ram the phone offers , leading to the occasionally laggy performance the only issue at this point that i 'd call major is an assisted gps issue the phone tends to struggle to lock onto satellites , and seems to lose these connections on a whim .
samsung has indicated that they are aware of the problem and are working on a fix , but there is no eta on that just yet .
that could prove to be a dealbreaker for some .
there are some user created fixes that seem to temporarily improve this , however that being said , as i mentioned before , i love this phone .
there 's a metric ton of apps available on the android market , and you can customize your phone from the very basic -LRB- just using the apps/widgets installed on the phone -RRB- to fancy clocks , weather , and other doo dads offering a plethora of information .
two notes about adding apps though the app market , as it comes on the phone , is controlled by at t ; and you are unable to side load apps -LRB- read put apps on that do not come from the app market -RRB- onto your phone .
there are work arounds to both of these though , if that 's your thing as for recommending this phone , i 'd do that on a individual basis , based on the user .
if you 're in dire need of the gps or need a completely lag free experience , this may not be the phone for you .
but if you can over look these things -LRB- and have faith in samsung providing the necessary fixes -RRB- , then i suspect you will love this phone as much as i do .
overall this is a great android phone for at t way better than the backflip or aria .
this is my first android device , and a smartphone after 2 years of iphone 3g .
i am amazed at the pace at which technology has changed for handheld devices .
i got the captivate yesterday , so its early days .
part of my amazement is for android part of it is for samsung why i chose this phone .
samsung .
i own a 52 and a 46 samsung lcd hdtvs and a samsung blu ray player .
they are jewels of my modest ht system .
i owned a verizon samsung phone before my iphone , using which i could get a signal in the basement of my office building google .
this is a company that has the balls to say that our are products are so good that we would give them for free , but make them so popular that we make money off of advertising revenues .
i am married to many google services like mail , voice , docs and apps for business .
very impressed by the innovative and high quality softwares at t .
after suffering at t for 2 yrs , i am big hater of the company .
but it and t mobile are the largest carriers to allow simultaneous voice and data , and at t is the larger of the 2 .
my girlfriend 's company also gives a 25 % discount on at t bills i hoped that the combination of the 3 would be a killer and i have not been very dissapointed so far i 'll try to summarise my feelings in point form what i loved .
very sleek and pocketable device 2 .
textured metal back with a nice latch system to keep things secure 3 .
covered usb -LRB- charging/syncing -RRB- port 4 .
mind blowing screen -LRB- as is the iphone4 's , but it is smaller in size -RRB- 5 .
simulated 5 .
1 surround sound space created when using headphones -LRB- i downloaded an hd preview of avatar , and could feel helicopters passing above my head -RRB- .
live wall papers 7 .
speech to text capabilities .
-LRB- outside of navigation -RRB- .
notification screen .
what i did n't care for but heard a lot of hoopla about .
widgets .
they are nice to have but the phone will die if there is a constant polling .
if they are polled infrequently they are point less .
you can not adjust the size of widgets .
google goggles this thing has failed to detect my text books from their outer cover .
it should have been like searching text but nooooo 3 .
voice activated navigation .
has not been able to successfully detect a single place i looked for 4 .
7 home screens .
what do i do with them .
the widgets are very lame and i would rather not have app shortcuts all over my desktop what i downright disliked .
gps functionality on the phone .
after spending an hour , on xda forums , i finally got the gps lock to work almost instantaneously every time , but why should i have to spend this time .
allows only an additional 16gb micro sd card 3 .
it doesnt have a flash .
so , the froyo updates to use the flash for video recording and as a flashlight in the dark would be pointless as would be low light photography 4 .
my battery ran out within 8 hours of charging and heavy use .
gotto to go to the forums and find out how to make this last longer a personal word , about apple vs android -LRB- having witnessed products of both camps -RRB- .
after being vociferous , for long , about my disdain for iphone , i realise that making an interface that is simple and yet powerful is an art .
one that android phones are yet to master however , apple would be outspent , in r d dollars , many times over by the oha , and would never be abe to catch up to feature set of android devices in its lifetime .
battle lines would be soon be drawn to get exclusivity from big software -LRB- games , productivity suites -RRB- and publishing houses .
whoever wins that war gets my money for the mobile device updated .
on aug 10 , 2010 .
if not for the gps issues i would have given 5 stars .
like maybe many of you , i 'm a longtime mac guy -LRB- my first is a iic actually still have my newton . -RRB-
i 've of course owned the original iphone more recently the 3g .
all have been trusty companions that i dearly loved and still love using , but , it 's time to upgrade the handset .
of course , i wanted the iphone4 , no brainer right .
well not so fast .
perhaps like many of you , i is a little underwhelmed by what the 4 had to offer .
sure , apple made some improvements but in my final view , facetime just is not enough to wow me besides being nearly unusable the other changes , let 's face it , were mostly about catching up to other smartphone offerings , no real game changers .
then antenna gate hit and along with it , very real concerns about call quality and inexcusably , more dropped calls than my 3g , which is bad enough as it is .
at t 's network issues notwithstanding , apple just did n't do enough with this phone , so , it became time to rethink my next smartphone .
a helpful young lad at my local t store suggested i await their upcoming galaxys phone .
i 'm glad i did .
believe me when i say i 'd prefer to stay with apple preserve my investment in apps but it says a great deal when a very loyal customer decides on an alternative product and foregoes that investment .
-LRB- are you listening cupertino .
it bears noting that i rarely make technology decisions without researching the bejeezus out of my options so trust me when i say i 've read just about all there is to offer on the captivate .
it 's not perfect but it 's also pretty damn close to being so it 's easily on par or better than the iphone 4 , truly .
i 've held both in my hands and messed with them for perhaps an hour at that same local t store .
it 's been a tough choice but i 'm gon na go with the captivate android .
-LRB- i will post a follow up review after a week or two of using the handset so stay tuned .
why i chose the android powered at t captivate over the iphone4 in no particular order i just can not get past the antenna issues dropped calls with the i4 .
i just can not .
this is supposed to be a highly engineered evolved communication tool you inexplicably botch something as rudimentary as it 's antenna .
there 's no excuse for that a free plastic bumper is no solution .
it just is not .
moreover , apple at t claim to have closely collaborated on this phone to ensure maximum performance on the network and dropped calls are worse .
how is this possible .
yes i know it 's a radio subject to the vagaries of obstacles , terrain , humidity bird flocks but c'mon , you could not even make a modest improvement .
hype aside , the i4 just is not that compelling an upgrade from the 3gs .
sure ios4 adds multitasking , unified inbox and folders but you can run that on your old 3gs .
yes the retina display is stunning a 1ghz a4 processor is welcome but again , these just keep pace with the market , nothing game changing .
in the end , the i4 is just too much like other iphones before it it 's my opinion it 's best to sit this one out wait till next year 's effort the captivate captured me -LRB- sorry -RRB- for a couple simple reasons larger and none too shabby amoled screen .
the extra real estate does make a difference .
android os .
it 's making huge strides in improving user functionality and innovation and if apple is not extremely careful ups it 's game , it will slip into also ran status quickly .
yes , the funky skins mfg 's place over android can be clunky , cumbersome a little confusing but in the end , you have many more options to customize change your user experience to your liking vs .
ios4 's locked down approach .
moreover , the pace on innovation seems to be accelerating with android , i sense we are reaching a real tipping point .
samsung has long made some excellent mobile phones it shows in the simple yet crucial aspect of this phone call quality .
data scarfing and game playing aside , let 's remember these are communication tools the fundamental function of calling people is still a big deal .
call me old school but i kinda like my phone to make calls without sending my blood pressure thru the roof finally , maybe this is trite a little arrogant but i 'm tired of seeing the same iphone i carry around in the hands of tweeners gorks with their heads buried in text messages , twitter facebook .
if the phone you choose says something about you then what does it say when spoiled brats loners desperate for attention are toting the same tool you use to run your life .
frankly i 'd like to see apple re invigorate the aspirational image of the iphone raise the barrier of entry by bumping the price updated .
on aug 13 , 2010 .
after anxiously awaiting the galaxy s to get to at t i finally got to retire my blackjack .
the captivate is a great phone , and i 'm very pleased with it , and the online forums have alot of useful information that at t never touched in what they call a user guide .
however as i spend more time with the phone i can find more cool things that its able to do .
i needed to upgrade from a previous samsung model , and considering the success i have had with samsung products , i felt that the samsung captivate is the perfect fit .
very happy with the operating system , very intuitive .
as i mentioned in my pro comments , the screen is unbelievable , seriously you have to see it in order to understand .
all in all , the pros of this phone outweigh the cons .
i will say this , most of the cons of this phone fall under the category of head scratchers .
this is a great upgrade from a previous samsung phone .
i is sick of the restrictions and issues with the iphone and wanted an android phone .
i is waiting for this phone cause at t is great in my area but did not have a great android device .
i 'm very happy with the phone and would highly recommend it .
currently i have had no issues with this phone .
i love the screen , so clear and bright .
there is no flash on the camera but it takes very nice and clear pictures .
volume levels are loud and clear .
comes with decent headphones .
recommend you put it in a protective case as soon as you can .
back looks as though it will scratch very easy , and the front screen smudges easy and wiping it a lot may scratch it .
i think that this is easily my favorite phone so far so far meaning its new , i am learning , and anything could go wrong .
i have an iphone and switch companies and got an evo 4g and then decided to get this one , i like this one the best .
i am not a tech person but i find this a sleek phone that is very user friendly .
-LRB- call me technologically challenged -RRB- and this works for me .
i upgraded from a samsung jack today .
i have never had a touch screen phone , and have n't really had the chance to use an iphone , so all of this is very new to me , and i 'm extremely happy so far i love how customizable the phone is .
i 'm discovering new things every time i pick it up -LRB- the pull down menu from the top , how to drag applications to the home screen , etc . -RRB-
many of the most useful apps are free , so that 's a huge plus i really wish i could delete half of the bloatware that came on the phone , but that does not look like an option at the moment , so i guess i 'll just live with it one complaint is what a pain in the butt it is to use punctuation .
i wish there is a way to convert back to the qwerty screen after choosing an apostrophe or question mark .
or is there something i overlooked .
also , the speakerphone is not as loud as my old phone .
that might be a pain later on , but i can live with it other than the above cons , i love it .
the form factor is spot on for someone who plans on using their data plan more than their talk minutes .
the screen size is right in between the incredible and the droid x , but the quality of the screen blows them both away .
the phone has been rooted already , so if at t gets too heavy handy with their policies , i 'll just work around them .
i stood in line and got an iphone 4 , returned it for obvious reasons -LRB- as well as a desire to use google voice in an integrated manner -RRB- , and now am the satisfied owner of the samsung captivate .
overall , this is a very nice device and i am extremely pleased .
calls are clear , speaker is loud , lots of care has been taken to make this device and interface really great this is coming from someone who has owned many incarnations of pda and smartphone from the original palm devices , winmo devices , and every version of iphone including 4 -LRB- although this is my first android device -RRB- .
the samsung captivate is light , fast , and beautiful , and i am happy to recommend this device for anyone who has a clue on how to use a smartphone , as this powerful hardware + android 2 .
1 lots of power and customization i would still recommend the iphone 4 -LRB- or 3gs -RRB- for someone who is not as tech oriented , as the captivate occasionally slowed down if i did n't manage background tasks myself with atk ; until i cleared out unneeded widgets and tweaked settings , there were occasional stutters and button feedback lags -LRB- but i do not let stuff run willy nilly and unchecked on my pc either , so i have no problem monitoring this myself -RRB- so yes , i am very glad i sweet talked that at t employee into selling me one of these on friday .
this phone may not yet be as famous or coveted as the iphone , but i wonder if there will be a quiet revolution of these galaxy s phones -LRB- since this series is now available on all major us carriers , and throughout the world -RRB- .
this is a very powerful phone , is fun to use , and can make and receive calls no matter how i hold it updated .
on jul 24 , 2010 .
had to download a calculator that actually worked .
body glove squeezes phone so hard it completely disables volume , ringer and answer controls .
love the android system , but captivate is slippery w/o a cover and that calc issue is annoying .
i 've had iphones since they first generation .
and i 've had my iphone 4 since the release date -LRB- waited in line 3 hours for it -RRB- .
i do like the iphone 4 .
however , i wanted to try an android phone and see what they were like .
the samsung capitvate so far it 's been a pretty good phone .
i really like the live wallpapers and all the different ways you can customize it .
it has good call quality .
but , the battery life is not as good as my iphone 4 .
but , that 's probably because of live wallpapers and some other updates i have running .
i do think the iphone 4 is easier to use and more fluid in movement when scrolling , etc .
movies are easier to add/sync on the iphone .
and netflix is on the iphone .
i really like the phone because it is just that a phone .
it works when it should .
the smart section of the phone is really nice too .
once i added a hard case the phone became a lot more comfortable in my hand .
initially it is a pain to hold and text .
texting is fast really fast .
camera is especially nice .
this unit is fast , though sometimes it gets a bit sluggish and i have to shut down processes that are not being used .
google voice search is a really nice feature .
if the gps and computer connection issues are worked out this phone is easily a 4 .
5 star effort .
i tried really hard to not let the weaknesses of this samsung overwhelm what is otherwise an awesome phone .
but , in everyday use , the ` cons ' just bothered me too much .
charger plug on top made it difficult to talk while charging without a headset .
the sensitive side buttoms caused me to either turn up the volume or put the screen to sleep -LRB- or lock the phone -RRB- every time i picked it up .
the gps is weak while inside buildings but is fine -LRB- although slow -RRB- when i had a clear view of the sky .
the thing that bothered me the most is the navigation keys at the bottom .
they are backlit and the light dims before the screen does and it is very difficult to see where they are .
so , i ended up hitting the wrong ones constantly or having to take a couple of stabs at gettng where i wanted to go .
it is really a shame that samsung did not approach this differently .
never could get the to work with my ford sync system either , although some have .
sadly , i returned the phone today .
my biggest gripe of all is these at t apps that auto boot upon bootup .
i did n't realize this until i downloaded advanced task killer from the market .
even after i kill task , at random times throughout the day , at t navigator turns on again .
honestly , i do n't want to pay 10 $ a month to use this app .
i wo n't use it , but why keep shoving it in my face .
why can not i just delete this app off the phone .
there are other apps that are set on auto boot , and i have no idea if there is even a way to disable that .
i 've read that you can remove these at t apps if you root the phone , but why should i void my warranty right after i got my phone .
also , even regular apps like the video player will turn on randomly in the background without you knowing .
it 's unjustifiable that i need to keep using my advanced task killer app to keep killing apps that automatically boot for no reason at random times .
can not say if rooting a phone can fix that another annoying thing is that samsung 's email app is stuck on your dashboard .
those 4 apps on the bottom can not be modified .
that email app sucks , and it does n't even sync to your contacts .
i do n't use it .
all of my emails are gmail , so i just use the gmail app .
it 's a shame that i have to have one of my 4 permanent icons be something that i will never use i miss having a phone with led flash .
i 've always used the led as a flashlight on my old nokia e63 .
i see no reason in why samsung should ever put out a high end smartphone without flash .
furthermore , this phone does not have a blinker to notify you of messages or anything when it 's idle .
i can not consider this phone to be very smart if i have to hit the power button just to view the unlock screen to know if i had missed messages or calls or anything the gps issue is known , and samsung did acknowledge it and said that they 'd put out a fix for it .
but here 's my concern from the fix that 's available that you can find , people are claiming that the issue is simply something wrong with the factory settings that shipped with the galaxy s phones .
i 'm not sure if this is true and that samsung 's fix will be simply tweaking these factory settings ; however , if that is the case , i will certainly not want to use this phone .
reason is , part of the fix is having to enable wireless networks to help locate those gps satellites , and enabling it allows google to automatically retrieve ` anonymous data ' at all times even when gps apps are n't running .
that just creeps me out , and i 'm not sure if i want my battery draining any faster than it already does when apps are turning on by themselves i must also comment that samsung 's hardware is never really good at syncing with computers .
i had to find a specific driver -LRB- took three tries -RRB- to be able to connect my phone to windows 7 64bit .
out of the box , you will not be able to just plug and play i really want to like this phone .
it 's at t 's best alternative to the iphone ; however , as you can see that locking of the market -LRB- you can only download apps off the android market , nowhere else -RRB- , loading it with at t apps that can not be removed unless rooted -LRB- these apps are n't loaded on the iphone . -RRB-
, and the fact that the galaxy s phones on verizon and sprint will have camera flash , at t really wanted you to pick the iphone .
i 'm only on at t because i have to be .
as much as i do not want an iphone , i can see why it 's the best choice on at t updated .
on aug 10 , 2010 .
like it .
i really wanted to like this phone .
i 've owned it for a week .
while it is a great looking phone -LRB- love the screen . -RRB-
with some cool features , i will be returning it .
the gps problems are disappointing .
and there is no reason why a phone of this type should not have a camera flash .
the soft keys on the bottom were annoying , requiring multiple presses at times on the plus side , the screen is large and bright , and i prefer it to the iphone 4 screen , even with the smaller resolution .
it is fun to customize the homescreens with various widgets .
i really liked the design .
it is more sleek and lightweight than the iphone 4 .
call quality is great .
this phone , simply put , is the single best phone i have ever had the pleasure using .
this phone screams .
samsung 's hummingbird processor is lightning fast .
there is no lag on the home screen when going through android 's multiple pages what so ever .
menu 's load almost too fast as well .
the display is superb in quality .
the contrast and vivid colors it produces are eye catching to say the least .
i have already had two people ask me what phone i had strictly because they noticed the amazing depth of color .
i would also briefly like to touch on the subject of samsung 's touchwiz skin that has been layered on top of android .
it is seamless .
someone new to android most likely would not be able to distinguish where android ends and touchwiz starts .
nothing from touchwiz detracts from android rather it fills in some gaps .
all in all it 's very synergistic .
i have put the captivate side by side with the evo and i can honestly say that the captivate is the hands down winner .
the screen quality is better , the menu navigation is much smoother and it felt more natural in the hand .
you can talk specs all you want but once in the hand you will take the captivate over the evo every time , i guarantee it the gps issue is big big big .
samsung needs to get a firmware fix out yesterday for this problem .
it is unacceptable for such a device to have a key feature not working .
i really is in a bad mood yesterday because everything else on the phone is so superb that i hated the idea of having to return the device .
thankfully xda dev is there as always to comfort me and give me a fix for the issue before samsung has even gotten around to it .
with that fixed i do not see myself getting a new phone any time soon .
overall , i 'm so glad that i decided on the captivate over the iphone 4 .
it 's a beautiful device and so far i am very impressed .
although i have noticed a little bit of lag , it has not been enough to be a deal breaker although there is some at t bloatware , the customization that comes with an android device is phenomenal , and i finally realize what i 've been missing while owning an iphone 3g .
however , apple 's app store is still superior to the android market swype takes some getting used to but it is such intriguing technology and can only get better with time , and with the upcoming froyo update , i know that the phone 's overall performance will be boosted even more .
its a beautiful and fast phone that works well if you do not mind charging constantly , and the unusable gps .
the at t lock down is an annoyance that can be overridden .
if you depend on gps at all , get another phone with proven gps ability .
if you want something usable and pretty , well this is your best android on at t at this time .
it is not a work horse , which is what i need for my business .
it has a lot of good features that can be used for a limited time due to the design flaws .
the apps that can be downloaded are interesting and appear to grow in number by the minute .
if all else fails i can go back to my ancient htc which does everything this does but does not overheat .
i 've had 3 phones in the last 8 weeks in sequential order the phone 4 , captivate , now the droid 2 .
i first upgraded to the iphone 4 since i had the 3gs and liked it , but then i decided to try something new and switched to the captivate to try android once switching to android , i definitely came to appreciate the simplicity and user friendliness of the iphone .
on the other hand , i had a lot of fun setting up the captivate too custom backgrounds , getting my home screen up , putting launcher pro on -LRB- beats the samsung ui as it beats most -RRB- , widget locker , putting on videos of any format -LRB- use rockplayer -RRB- .
let 's just say , it took me many many hours .
at this point , i noticed my phone is slowing down .
noticeable but not horrible i annoyed my bf with complaints but shrugged off the slowdown .
then i put my exchange email on and it became even slower .
then after a couple days , when my exchange stopped syncing , i did some research and realized that my work securities settings was not compatible with android 2 .
1 and the native exchange app .
i then proceeded to try touchdown which my co worker loves and would have solved the exchange issue .
getting pass the 80 's looking ui of touchdown , it had a lot of advantages , however there is a hitch .
it took 4 hours to download my emails at set up , minimum of 30 seconds to open an email or do anything that involves switching screens .
so basically it did not work .
after more research , i found that touchdown knows about the issue .
they think it 's caused by the fact that for some reason the internal memory is an sd card which is my guess as well after all that , i decided i liked the flexibility and additional functionality of android though it involved more work than the iphone , but could not live with how slow the captivate became or my exchange email issue .
therefore , i 've moved on to the droid 2 .
that 's another review .
so i am a huge fan of samsung products tvs , phones , you name it .
my brother has this phone and has not had any problems with it .
i thought about getting it but am content with my samsung t401 on the net10 service .
it 's high quality and saving me a bunch being on a great prepaid service .
yay for samsung products .
samsung knows there are gps issues .
i bought 3 of these and all three had the same exact gps problems .
virtually could not lock and tried every fix and nothing .
att finally told me they have had many other reporting the same issues .
do not buy if you want it for gps .
i have been with at t and wanted a android phone so bad from them , but had to drop them after 15 years to go get a droid x .
they all lock on gps quickly and can be trusted based on the 8 people i know who owns some form of android phone .
the samsung captivate is part of the much ballyhooed galaxy s line , and as such with such great reviews , i had high hopes for this phone , and perhaps that is the problem , as i found it a letdown at every turn .
yes , it sports a nice 1ghz -LRB- snapdragon -RRB- processor , but unfortunately it needs it as touchwiz weighs down the display and functionality of the phone touchwiz also changes thing for no apparent reason , like making the app drawer scroll left and right -LRB- page by page -RRB- rather than smooth scrolling up and down app drawer like every other android device .
i guess this is supposed to mimic the apple way of loading apps , but i do n't like or want an iphone , so why go after a phone that mimics it .
i knew at t is going to kill side loading of apps , but to remove the samsung store as well .
one of the most touted custom apps for the galaxy s line of phones is roadsms , and you can not get it -LRB- or any other samsung store offerings -RRB- because at t does n't allow it .
that is just plain dumb camera quality is ok to good , but the lack of a flash on the at t version of the phone is curious and makes the phone photo abilities lacking the phones rounded design -LRB- another attempted rip apple -RRB- makes the phone less that comfortable fit in the hand and makes one handed operation a bit awkward the agps is broken , it a known issue but there is no time for fixing it this is the best android based phone on at t that you can get subsidized , but still has some major flaws .
if you can still find it -LRB- and do not mind paying full price -RRB- , the nexusone continues to be the best choice for android for at t , at least so far .
received mine at 2 pm today .
at 4 pm called at t for a return authorization .
as much as i do not like my 3gs the captivate is not there yet .
my favorite large screen android phone i have had a chance to use , sll though with all the hooplah over the amoled display i expected iphone like clarity in a larger format and unfortunately it is lacking there .
too me it is similar to going back to a standard definition tv after seeing hd .
camera funtions and options were very nice , but if you going to give us all of that why would n't you give us a flash .
the phone is very slim and fits in a pocket just a comfortable as the iphone 4 .
the android and touch wiz navigation is spot on and responded as smoothly and quickly as the iphone .
on board memory with the option to expand is a nice touch as well .
the biggest reason i would get this phone however is that at t allows insurance to be placed on it .
you lose or break your captivate you pay $ 50 and get another .
you lose or break your iphone and you better head to ebay or shell out $ 500 $ 700 .
i would recommend this phone to anyone that did n't already own an iphone .
if they did own an iphone and were ok with the lack of flash and did not care about the display i would recomment getting this phone over the iphone 4 .
i had been waiting for this phone to come out for a few weeks now .
i is an iphone 3g user who experienced all the problems most everyone had faced with the ios4 upgrade .
needless to say , i is looking for an entirely different phone with comparable features , and this phone seemed worthy from all the research i performed first , the pros .
the phone , while larger than the iphone , is lighter and less cumbersome in the palm of my hand .
not to be mistaken for a cheap feeling ; rather , it seemed more of quality engineering given the extraordinary hardware inside .
right out of the box , the phone 's screen is truly marvelous , with a bright crystal clear display like none i have seen before .
the captivate has not been buggy , shown any sign of lag when on the internet , and overall is more impressive than the iphone .
yes , there is no flash on the camera , which is not an issue for me from the getgo , as i use a digital camera more often anyway .
however , the 5mp camera shoots very acceptable pictures for a camera phone .
i needed a phone that could perform well in terms of scheduling , organzing my time and appointments in a calendar , keeping on top of social networking and ability to save contacts to an sd card in addition to syncing to a server -LRB- just in case there is a network crash anywhere along the line -RRB- .
this phone would be able to meet my expectations in everything i expected the cons , however , are what ultimately will have me return the phone first thing tomorrow morning .
at t service is not as widespread as say , verizon , and with my iphone i is able to at least use my phone within my house .
i live in a valley that does not have the best at t coverage , but my friends with blackberries can also use their phones at my home and still maintain at least 1 bar of coverage .
my parents , whom both have regular run of the mill flip phones also get the same kind of service in my home .
this phone , no matter where i am in my home , does not receive service at all .
i can get reception outside , but that is unrealistic in having to maintain calls .
the antennae is extraordinarily disappointing , and the biggest drawback to the captivate .
if you live in an area where reception is not an issue , you should not have a problem .
however , if you travel often -LRB- and at t 's coverage nationwide is spotty -RRB- , you more than likely will have similar problems my other gripe is that the android operating system is not entirely user friendly .
it is very complex , and would definitely take me some time to use .
when i received my first iphone , i is up and runnng alot easier than with the captivate .
i 've had the phone for 5 hours now , reading the online tutorial by at t , and while it is helpful , i can not follow along so well because of the lack of service in my home .
even though the tutorial gives you a simulated captivate to practice on , it would be alot easier for me to use my own phone to follow along so i could actually feel like i 'm learning my actual phone lastly , i find it very unnecessary to sync all google contacts to the phone .
e mails that were sent only once to a new individual are saved as contacts , which i would have to constantly delete , as to unsync the phone would also unsync all the contacts that i regularly do use .
so it stinks , either way i really , really would love to love this phone .
unfortunately , i will definitely return it tomorrow as the cons far outweigh the advantages that the iphone afforded me .
more than likely , i 'll get a 3gs as the new iphone also has antennae issues if you decide to get this phone , make sure you have really good patience and time to learn the features , and be in an area that gets really decent at t coverage .
i plan on getting a replacement in the morning .
i have read of a few others with similar phantom back space problems .
if it were not for this problem , i would rate this phone a 4 .
5 to 5 .
it really is a nice phone .
hopefully , the replacement works like it 's supposed to updated .
on jul 17 , 2010 .
the android market website features only a small fraction of the available apps .
i can not do a search of the website to find apps i might be interested in but are not on their featured pages .
the site specifially says to get a full list , log in from my handset .
huh .
i 'm not buying the phone until i know whether apps i want are available .
i 'm not buying the phone and then discover that apps i want are not available for the android phone .
so , do not put all the blame on at t for restricting apps .
google is just as bad and money hungry as is at t .
att wants $ 60 per month for the connectivity , $ 60 a month for the hot spot , you name it the lousy cheepskates want you to pay for it by the month .
only other bad thing is by the time you get the update they have you locked in to a two year contract .
the gps problem is a huge deal breaker .
otherwise , i would be very happy with the phone , despite the bloatware , which inhibits performance .
unfortunately , att chooses to play dumb on the gps issue , while samsung is using stall tactics .
very disappointed with the lack of service from both parties .
love my androids , but i 've returned the captivate for an iphone4 .
if you feel geeky and want to spend couple days rooting the phone , searching forums and fixing samsung 's bugs you can have a great phone -LRB- gps fix , lagfix that replaces file system are must -RRB- .
if you just want phone that works samsung is not for you .
this phone has a lot of really great things going for it .
it 's gorgeous , the touchscreen is responsive and accurate and call quality is good .
samsung 's new version of the touchwiz interface is great , especially the contacts list .
unfortunately , the gps refused to lock on even once in the three weeks that i had the device , and none of the fixes -LRB- changing ports , servers , etc -RRB- had an effect .
it also had a very hard time switching between wifi and 3g .
on my blackberry 9700 , when i switch from 3g data to a wireless hotspot , the transition is seamless .
with the captivate , i had to log out of chat and restart the browser to continue using the services .
this is less of an issue than the gps problem , but it is a significant annoyance .
finally , after only three weeks of use , the device is getting noticeably sluggish -LRB- long app loading times , slow return to the homescreen , lagging typing -RRB- , even immediately following a hard reboot .
i do not know anyone else who has this model , so i am not sure if i got a lemon or if the problems are systemic , but i returned the phone today and happily went back to blackberry .

Battery life is great !

Swype is an amazing feature. ; There are no cons .
Everything , it 's not perfect but nothing really is .
movies , media social networking , texting all done very well. ; At &#38; t made all the data plans more expensive , they also block all the good features of this phone .
The main thing is they removed the free application softwares and added their proprietary softwares which cost about 10 dollars each a month .

; No flash for the camera good camera good video also I really like the app `` places '' I also like the google navigator , the screen is nice ; yes the GPS does take time to connect but it does come on , I 've never had to charge a phone so much .
Now I know what it 's like to really need a car charger The `` feel '' of the captivate in your hand is wonderful .
It is a large phone , however , the lightness is suprising .
The look of the screen is flat out great .
The overall peformance is better then I expected. ; The battery life could last a bit longer , but it 's as good as most of the other phone I looked at .
1 -RRB- the amount of memory , 2 -RRB- the super amoled screen , 3 -RRB- the size and weight compared to other smartphones , 4 -RRB- hd video capture , 5 -RRB- hd video playback , 6 -RRB- the 5mgp camera w/macro zoom , etc. . .

Quick interface . .

-LRB- No support from Samsung for SGH-i897 yet -RRB- .
Mine has a mind of its ' own .
-LRB- Backs up to previous page without input from user .
Frustrating when you are scrolling through apps -RRB- .
AT &#38; T Bloatware .
Can not set individual ringtones .
Nice looking screen -LRB- Super AMOLED -RRB- , lots of headroom with 16 GB of onboard memory available , HD Video Capture ; No sideloading of apps , even the Samsung Store is removed , TouchWiz is better but still a clunky offbeat experience that changes too much for no good reason , no flash , aGPS is busted , Battery life Amount of features , Ease of navigation , easy to use out of the box , great apps .

Excellent multimedia capabilities ; .

MicroUSB port placement ; Love the Screen .
On screen Keyboard .
As ; Nothing .
The GPS feature everyone has been complaining about does n't bother me at all .
My car has a GPS and that is what I use .
Besides using a GPS on a phone is not something I have ever used or intend on using .

The first thing that pops is the super rich screen .
The super AMOLED screen is amazingly beautiful and bright .
The 1GHZ processor is snappy and rarely chugs .
Graphics for games are very nice .
FREE Angry Birds is amazing as well. ; Background data really eats at your 200 MB limit if on the smaller plan .
Text messaging interface can irritate .
No flash on the camera ?
Really ?
You carry a navigation system , a reliable voice call maker , a HD video camera , a fantastic multimedia device that is stylised by curves and glossy black .
I like the added control I have over the filemanagement and freedom from iTunes. ; Samsung is a fool not to have done proper QA before unleashing the device .
Why transfer the burden of fixing the GPS to consumers ?
Simple transferring files after connecting to USB requires a google search .
Why not make these little things simpler ?
Google Voice , Samsung Keyboard , Swipe Keyboard .
Brilliant Display and I love the large screen -LRB- very easy to text -RRB- .
Battery is just as good as the 3GS .
Very thin and classy looking. ; When starting the Turn by Turn navigation it takes awhile to find the GPS .
Facebook app is n't quite on par with the iOS facebook app , nor is the media player .
The screen is very nice on the captivate .
The built in speaker is really loud .
The call quality is really good. ; A flash for the camera would be nice .

Best screen technology currently available .
Super fast running Android 2.1 and will be even faster when the 2.2 upgrade comes out .
Device can be customized any way you like and also rooted. ; No camera flash or front facing camera .
Nevertheless , I 'm sure both of those features will be in the next revision of the Galaxy S line , especially once AT &#38; T begins rolling out their 4G network .
Beautiful screen , good camera , fast , very slim , light. ; Only thing i do not like about this phone is the bad battery life it can be solved my installing some apps but still you should n't have to do this for your phone to survive a day 4 '' screen is bright and clear , 5mp camera takes great pictures and much better than average video , Swype texting is awesome , Hummingbird processor is fast , 16 GB internal storage , Android Market is comparable to Apple , calls are loud and clear ; Battery life is short , scrolling lags a little , have n't figured out how to set default storage location of downloaded attachments in mms to external sd card .
Nice big screen and clear , takes great pics , pretty much the same apps offered .
Faster than the iphone .
You can actually do the speed test and it will show you !
; I do not like that it has a front facing camera and at &#38; t did not turn it on !
I guess they are scared that it may actually take some iphone customers away !!!! That is the only Con I have !
Interface is very smooth .
Amoled screen is beautiful .
Swype texting is not only fun but fast and efficient .
When connected to wifi the Captivate is unbeatable .
I love the way you can customize unlock screen .

- Touchwiz &#38; Android together is surprisingly a smooth combination .
- Feels good in the hand especially with a metal back cover .
- HD video recording and good point &#38; shoot camera .
- Strong Battery .
- Great graphics performance ; - Although Battery is good with all the bells and whistles on you will notice a drain -LRB- obviously -RRB- .
- Although I like the design personally some people do n't care for `` sharp '' edges and prefer round .
- Screen can lose some visibility outdoors Awesome screen , easy to operate -LRB- especially if you 've used the iphone -RRB- , the phone is very light , love google voice feature , normal reception , love the new write and go feature , love swype !
; The only con I can think of is there are fewer apps for the android than the iphone The screen is beautiful the feel is sleek and comfortable very easy to use very clear sound and voice .
Totally customizable from wallpapers to screen savers to icons awesome camera and HD video !!!!!!!!!! ; I only wish that it had a front facing cam for video chat other than that it is perfect !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Screen - Probably the best contrast I 've seen on a phone .
Size - Although it has a large screen , the phone is very slim and light .
OS - Finally an Android AT &#38; T phone worth mentioning !

Clear , bright , colorful and BIG !
Even though the phone is big , its very light yet sturdy feeling .
` Talk to Text ' works amazingly well .
I love speaking my text messages !
I got a strong costant signal. ; Charger connection on top .
Side buttons too sensitive .
Navigation ` buttons ' at bottom dim out before screen does and are n't always responsive .
This has been very irritating .
Weak GPS .
Ugly Exchange interface .
Great package , classy look , great screen .
Pluses include using GoogleMaps for navigation , multiple email accounts , and nice large keys for texting .
Upgradability to FROYO -LRB- Droid 2.2 -RRB- was a purchase point .
; Flash videos will be available with FROYO updatem abd there is intermittant probkems with the GPS unit that SAMSUNG is supposed to have fixed .
I may have to return my &#38; a new model to fix the GPS since the FROYO update is not being planned just yet .
Light , Beautiful LED screen , smooth with 1GHZ CPU , camera is very clear with tons of imaging options as well as 720p video , battery life , ; useless AT &#38; T duplicate appz , the drivers DO NOT work with Windows 7 64bit , screen is little on the sensitive side .
believe it or not , the death grip is not limited to the iPhone .
The captivate has it as well -LRB- among other phones -RRB- * AT &#38; T Best Alternative to the iPhone .
* You do n't need to pay for ringtones through iTunes .
* 3x the Amount of Customization than iPhone .
* REAL MULTITASKING .
* Supports most video playback including xvid ; * You can not edit the four bottom icons on your home screens .
* AT &#38; T has put a few bloatware apps on it , but not enough to slow it down .
* No front camera or flash .
* Android Market lacks the quality of the Apple App Store ... .
for now .
* The AMOLED is beautiful .
Call quality is great .
No dropped calls .
I have been able to find all the apps I used on my iPhone 4 in the Android Marketplace. ; The phone takes some time to learn .
It 's certainly not as easy as the iphone but I have had fun learning all the new functions .
It feels very well-made ... the display is beautiful ... but most of all , I am in love with the customization of the phone and with the Swype technology !
; There is some attenuation with the signal , yet I can send and receive text messages without error and I have yet to experience a dropped call .
There is a slight lag when switching between home screens , opening apps , and pressing the home keys .
Best hardware , fast CPU .
Excellent screen .
Very comfortable in the arm ; Frequent lags -LRB- Samsung put proprietary and slow file system on Android , instead of proven free EXT2/EXT4 -RRB- . .
GPS is very slow to acquire position and can be very inaccurate . .
The phone will drive you mad with many bugs and slow performance .
Key points that I believed make the Samsung Captivate shine above other devices . .
- 4 '' super AMOLED screen .
- 1ghz HummingBird processor .
- video recording in 720p .
- build quality .
- use of Android market .
- WiFi .

- no flash on camera .
- no front mounted camera .
- Battery life could be better .
- no 3rd party apps Touch screen is on point , copy/pasting very simple -LRB- just like an iPhone -RRB- , very fast processor so flipping through pages and apps is very smooth with no lag , phone is very thin and pretty light weight , and the display is gorgeous for videos. ; Design of phone is a little too square , and ca n't change the bottom four apps on the tool bar of the home page .
Good feel , quick operation , variety of features , bright view screen , many apps to choose from , all make it a great upgrade from the HTC Pure phone I had previously running Windows 6.5 , with a bigger screen , separate .
earphone jack with headphones. ; Getting used to the android system takes a little time if you have had 2 Windows phones before .
Pictures I had loaded from my HTC Pure would not load to the phone directry contacts , maybe I have to do it some other way ? .
The phone 's almost addictive .
Absolutely beautiful screen .
Smooth -LRB- Touchwiz -RRB- interface .
Camera works great and takes clear pictures .
Solid build , yet very light and pocketable .
Battery life is comparable with other smartphones including iPhone 4 -LRB- which I returned and got Captivate -RRB- ; GPS had slow signal acquisition at times , even with clear view of sky .
Problems syncing with MS Vista -LRB- looped into MTP mode when connected to PC -RRB- .
Ca n't see buttons unless screen is active .
AT &#38; T duplicates stock Android apps with their own useless apps Screen is gorgeous .
Phone is responsive to input and commands. ; It feels a little wide in my hand when on a call .
This is the largest phone I have ever owned , so it may just take a little getting used to .
AT &#38; T 's restrictions to sideloading and censored market can be overcome but need to root the phone to do so .
ALOT !
I love the messaging on this phone , it is in the bubble format so you can follow the flow of your conversation with someone :--RRB- , Apps on this phone are awesome , you can customize your screens to your liking .
Duel clock .
WiFi .
What else ?!
; Not a lot of cons .
You just need to make sure you download a task killer when you buy this phone .
Its free FYI .
So it does n't drain your battery .
4 '' display in a form factor shorter -LRB- / lighter -RRB- than iPhone 4 . .
AMOLED is great indoors . .

Swype typing included .
Very customizable .
Very fast .

Screen is n't great in sunlight . .
No vibrate on SMS / voicemail ?
4 '' S-AMOLED screen that makes my 32 '' Samsung LCD HDTV feel inadequate . .
Ability to expand storage by an additional 32 GB -LRB- 48 GB total storage space -RRB- . .
Ability to play videos from the phone on an HDTV via an HDMI adapter . .
The Hummingbird processor is fast ; AT &#38; T got their hands on it early and removed the ability to download/install apps that are not from the Android Market . .

Requires restart to fix . .
Android Market is not as extensive as the App Store .
Super AMOLED screen .

Navigation is a little buggy , hopefully fixable with software.Never heard of Kies for PC/Mac ?
Its their `` iTunes '' - have to hunt for it &#38; USB dirvers The screen is beautiful , very viewable in direct sunlight .
The phone is fast , and works well overall. ; The GPS is worthless , doesnt get locks half the time , when it does get locks it jumps all over the map .
Samsung promised a fix in September that never came , now they are saying November !
Battery life is below average , about 10 hours with no use .
I was contemplating an iPhone4 in the store when this phone 's screen caught my eye .
I had an immediate emotional reaction to the large , vivid display -- I 'd never felt such a pang of desire for a phone .
I took it home , and it 's changed my life. ; No LED flash .
AT &#38; T sucks for blocking 3rd party apps .
And seriously , where is the Froyo update ?
it has a bigger screen , more freedom on the apps section , blazing fast , lighter than my iphone , its more for the advanced user .
I was very nervous about switching as people said I was married to my iphone .
This phone has captivated my heart !
; No flash and a camera in the front Great screen , good call quality -LRB- compared to the iPhones -RRB- , battery life over the 3GS , screen is somewhat usable in direct summer so cal sunlight -LRB- still no iPhone -RRB- , expandable memory on top of the 16 GB internal , and swype. ; Flakey gps , noticeable slow down when downloading apps , lag when launching or closing apps , blueish cooler color temp , pentile pixel layout is a bit annoying on small text , and poor build quality .
Size/weight/form-factor makes carrying much easier than iPhone 4 .
Android OS rocks , with all of the customization of a bazillion apps in the open market , plus added features like Swype text input exclusive to Samsung. ; I like that the volume button on the side is easy to press , though it may be accidentally pressed during use , particularly when holding the device in landscape .
Screen can smudge easily .
Charging requires plugging in a physical USB cable .
Light , fast , Android , Android apps .
CAN sideload apps with application from Android Central . .
Recognized as mass storage device , easy sync with Google .
GPS services are great and show what is possible with location services. ; Multitasking can slow phone and drain battery .
Works like a small computer and therefore has some of the same issues-occasionally have had to restart when the phone seemed to have `` locked-up '' .
Feels nice , very light in the hand , screen very clear and bright .
Switched from iPhone to Evo to this one , so far really working out well , had no problems with reception or using with windows 7 -LRB- one comp 32 , on comp 64 b -RRB- .
SWYPE !!!! ; No flash on camera .
Too many preloaded apps but you can store them away in a folder .
That 's all .
The Captivate has the muscle to get the job done , whether you 're wanting to play a little game of solitaire , or multi-task across the a variety of things simultaneously .
Android OS , and innovative Swype text entry are astounding !
; The camera is a bit touchy to get focused , and It can be a bit difficult keeping track of where all of your apps and files go , but that 's easily fixed with one of the many file explorer programs on the market .
Absolutely beautiful screen . .
Sleek , lightweight design . .
Customizable homescreens that are easily navigated . .
Great call quality . .
Fun and unique features , like swiping a contact right to call or swiping it left to message . .

Soft keys at the bottom of the phone are not very responsive , and only visible when lit . .
Some lag when moving between screens or programs .
Beautiful screen , Bright and Crystal clear .
Camera is quite good , video is good .
Works well as a phone .
Easy to turn on bluetooth , GPS , easy to turn off applications via pre loaded apps. ; The battery life with GPS Bluetooth active drains fast , if plugged in to mains , it overheats .
Once a critical point of temperature is reached it is programmed to stop charging .
It is no good for prolonged use as a navigator for your car .
SCREEN !
Color saturation and contrast ratio are better than most HD TVs I 've seen .
The size of the screen is just right for * really * using the web browser .
Text is very sharp and easy to read .
Very thin , fits in my pocket comfortably .
Fast UI. ; Windows 7 wo n't recognize it , the driver install errors out .
Had to transfer my music using the memory card shuffle method .
Backlight on the hardware buttons times out too quickly , making it awkward to use at night .
Great screen size .
Great screen contrast -LRB- the black on this phone is super black -RRB- .
Phone is n't too big like some of the other new android phones .
Browser is super fast and has pinch to zoom .
Will be upgradable to 2.2 ; Not as refined as iphone but way more customizable .
Touch buttons on the bottom could be more sensitive and stay lit longer .
Integrates well with gmail but not yahoo .
Extremely light weight and thin with a spectacular screen nothing short of amazing .
Performance is a beast , battery life is better than expected and the size is just about perfect .
Comes with 16BG stock and is expandable to 48 !
; No flash or front camera .
GPS is unreliable .
I wish the USB input where on the bottom .
AT &#38; T network is garbage .

- Bill The large , bright screen.The speed is like lightening.I LOVE the touch screen ... it 's truly better than the Iphone.I love the applications that came with the phone and can not wait to download more.I am an Iphone junkie &#38; can not believe this is better. ; The only thing I can think of is even though you get out of an application you are in , it does not automatically stop that app from running ; however , there is an app called Advanced Task Killer .
Just download that and your problem is solved .
Larger screen with out haiving too big a form factor to fit in your pocket , AT &#38; T will allow insurance on this phone , Touch Wiz GUI really smooth and responsive , swappable battery , camera has a ton of built in features. ; Resolution of the screen is just lacking after seeing the clarity of the iPhone 4 Retina Display , yeah there is a lot of screen real estate but needs higher resolution , No camera flash blew me away especially considering the amout of camera features .
Screen is brilliant , great wireless cell and WiFi reception , Android functions and apps are smart .
cheap and easy to use .
ATT Micro Cell in a Basement office works great with it .
Music streaming uses little bandwidth. ; Lots of apps I do n't need , but you can ignore them or delete most .
I downloaded an app that whacked out my phone , re-built it in a an hour - did not lose anything , Amazing .
Beautiful display , easy to use , intuitive user interface .
The design of the phone is very agreeable , offering a large screen and vivid display , bursting with color .
16 GB internal storage plus a Mini SD slot. ; Loaded with ATT BLOATWARE .
Many of the preloaded apps are pay , including WHERE -LRB- free on my last handset -RRB- .
Most IMPORTANTLY , extremely POOR GPS signal , unable to locate you on Google Maps or provide any real time directions .
Beautiful - both the body and display .
Android - lots of customizability and access to the 3rd party applications .
Battery life - seems better than other android phones .
Sound quality/Media player is great .
16 GB internal memory ; Processor does n't quite seem like a 1 GHz .
No radio -LRB- however you can just stream it using 3G -RRB- .

5MP camera and 720P Video ; If I HAD to say a Con it would be no Flash on the Camera , but to me , when is it really needed ?
How much does the flash on your phone make or break a picture ?
There are many different shooting modes to get around this .
Screen , Android system , swype and camera are awesome .
The phone is really light , and many free Apps in the Android marketplace .
Oh yeah ... I can replace the battery and expand the memory without any issues !
Google maps and navigation are sweet !
; Not too comfortable in my hand , does not consistently link to Vista , and the micro usb is in a recess .
Android Marketplace is way behind Apple .
GPS is sometimes really slow .
No flash .
Email is slow , and not all links will work when you click on them .
The graphics are superb .
The browser is awesome .
The lack of camera flash does not bother me .
The ease of downloading and installing programs from Android Market .
I love everything about the phone except for a couple of things. ; Battery life and not be able to access SD cards and internal memory when connected to a PC .
Ca n't sync Outllook 2010 directly to the phone .
Also am having some Bluetooth issues .
Nice screen , touch screen interface is great . .
Copies iphone internet finger motions which is nice to see .
Good phone call quality so far .
Good reception .
Feels sturdy .
Awesome options for live wallpapers which are fun .
Battery lasts all day ; Android 2.1 ... no flash .
It 's 2010 , get with the program .
No availability of streaming movies yet , sure this will be fixed soon .
Ca n't sideload apps `` for my own protection '' Thanks Samsung but I can take care of myself Big Brother Hummingbird CPU , Android 2.2 , Flash 10.1 in the browser , functions as a mobile 3G access point with no additional fees -LRB- with the right ROM -RRB- , giant and very bright screen thanks to it being AMOLED , lightweight , finally a decent Android phone on ATT ; No flash for the camera , some have complained about the GPS being wonky , default Touchwiz UI is junk -LRB- easily replaced with launcher pro -RRB- Multimedia powerhouse .
The hummingbird processor is hella fast , it has all share built in , an awesome music player with eyecandy to spare , a nice video player and the ability to play any android game flawlessly .
Easy to see in sunlight. ; Not a whole lot of accessories at this point -LRB- cases etc -RRB- , I would like it if the battery lasted a little longer , but it gets me through the day with no problems .
There is no flash but the camera handles low light conditions like a pro !
Great screen .
A lot of things are intuitive .
Pretty good app store -- this is my first smart-phone , so I 'm not sure which are the best to have , but I 've been able to find everything that I 've looked for -LRB- bar-code reader , ring-tone maker , etc. -RRB- ; Sound could be a bit louder .
It 's difficult to locate information both on the web &#38; on the phone -- getting the phone to quit notifying me when I have new e-mail was quite an adventure in menu trial &#38; error . .
User Manual not included Screen is absolutely amazing , call quality is great , internet browsing is intuitive and extremely quick , phone in general is very snappy and powerful , touchwiz on top of android makes for very customizable , unique , and attractive backgrounds ; Battery life , while not bad , is not spectacular either -LRB- at least compared to my old blackberry bold -RRB- .
GPS is n't spectacular , though it is very quick now with the update .
No front facing camera , flash on the back camera .
gorgeous screen , easy to use interface , NOT an iPhone , lots of great apps and built in tools . .
All the TV 's in my house are Samsung and I love their picture quality so my expectations were set high from experience .
I was not disappointed ; if you use a protective silicon case , the lip may make touching the menu keys on the bottom of the device a bit difficult to use .
This is a pretty minor issue though and I 'd blame the case more than I 'd blame the phone design .
Fabulous screen .
Best phone camera .
Android which I love for the following - .
No more converting to MP4 to watch a video -LRB- so much time saved -RRB- .
Integration of contacts from Facebook , Work , and Gmail ; Internal memory is a SD card - slows everything down !!! .
No pin code option for exchange - aka not work with my work email set-up .
No camera flash - why At &#38; t stripped it I have no idea .
No upgrade to Froyo yet Screen - Absolutely a beautiful screen with great clarity and response . .
Sound - Not just through the speaker , but also the clarity when talking to someone . .
Android - This Mobile OS is amazing .
The world is in trouble if Google decides to make a real OS. ; No Flash - not that big of a deal , but considering how good the camera is you would think there would be a flash . .
Connection - Surprised to see that Samsung has gone with yet another USB connection making the many Samsung chargers that I have obsolete .
What 's not to like ?
The screen is amazing .
The size of the phone is perfect for me .
After 2 weeks no dropped calls though I 've never had a problem here 30 miles SW of Chicago .
Feature rich apps and widgets , highly customizable .
Simply amazing !
; Battery life - though admittedly i ca n't seem to put it down unless I am sleeping .
GPS wo n't lock .
Fix is apparently being released currently - Hopefully that will fix it .
Ca n't use maps but it will put you in the ballpark for other apps for now .
Beautiful screen with rich colors and great video quality . .
Easy to use overall in figuring out apps , how to use features . .
Great speaker !
Best I have had for speakerphone or when listening to music/other media without earbuds. ; While it is overall easy to figure out , I was disappointed with the lack of a real user manual included in the box . .
Turning down the sound during calls has been a little iffy .
It can be very loud and not seem to turn down when I try to adjust it .
