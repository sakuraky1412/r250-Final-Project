this is our main unit in the family room  .
the video quality blew me away  .
i would call it wonderful  .
i read that some older units had audio sync issues , meaning the sound had a delay and did not match the lips of the speaker and lg had to upgrade it with a firmware  .
not the unit that i bought  .
the case should be closed  .
plus , whoever bought the unit should have a home theater with a decent sound system  .
i can  .
t imaging people spent over a thousand to buy a hd tv and keep complaining about sound quality  .
hd tv should match a surround sound system , not a native speaker  .
this is the first lg electronic unit  .
i have just found lg makes high devices with affordable price  .
i went on and bought a lg blue    ray player , very happy about them both  .
i am going to write a good review for the blue    ray later  .
the only thing that i am not happy is that days after i bought the unit the prices started to drop a bit  .
other than that , no complaints updated  .
on may 26 , 2010  .
you wo not beat this tv for the money  .
even may higher priced tv's cannot compete with this  .
overall a very high quality addition to any home .
i would recommend this tv to anyone  .
it took me a long time to get this tv i had to deal with best buy and it is crazy i first started off with the sony 46inch w series and it is defective , then i got another one and it is defective so i is talked into buying the a samsung and i could not stand the glare on the tv at all  .
so they gave me a 52 inch v5100 for free  .
i had that tv for about 3 weeks and it just is not the picture i is looking for  .
i brought it back and they swapped it out for this tv for free  .
i am in love with this tv especially since i only payed $950 for it   )  .
the first sony i bought is the ps3 package deal and that is only $950 muahahah  .
i love it  .
picture is outstanding for gaming , movies , tv , etc  .
the led backlighting with local dimming rocks  .
great value  .
i is buying samsung led until i saw this deal late october .
every thing from the the appearence to the functionality to the audio and picture quality and the freedom to choose from an extensive list picture and audio presets/setting and can adjust it according to my convienience .
my components are as follows    .
55 lh90  .
lg bd390 blu    ray player  .
cox motorola hddvr set top box  .
pioneer a1019ah    k receiver  .
first let me say that i really wanted a plasma but did not want to deal with break    ins and burn    ins  .
most of my tv watching centers around financial , news , and sports channels that have tickers strolling continuously therefore i thought it best to purchase the best lcd on the market  .
mission accomplished i wanted to install the components without the receiver just to see if i would experience the lip sync problems that are associated with the set  .
utilizing the hdmi connections i connected the cable box and the bd 390 directly to the tv but did not experience the lip sync problem with either  .
the picture is outstanding and i is extremely pleased with the tv  .
even the netflix streamed movies and youtube playback over a wireless connection (via the bd 390) is flawless  .
then i broke down the connections and reinstalled everything through the receiver  .
same results  .
therefore i can honestly say that the tv is everything that i hoped it would be  .
by the way i is able to program the pioneer remote to control everything including all of the functions of each component  .
this is a pleasant surprise  .
i must admit that at this moment i am one happy camper  .
the picture on this tv is outstanding .
i went through 4 hdtvs before getting this one  .
i knew i wanted 1080p and 240 hz  .
i went to a local furniture store and got the sony 46z5100  .
when i got it home , i loved it , until the sun went down  .
in darker rooms , the backlight shines through and creates uneven colors and bright spots in darker display scenes  .
i got online and found out this is a common problem with the sony lcds i took it back and the sales rep talked me into a toshiba 1080p , 240hz tv  .
junk  .
i hated it  .
it is too bright and the colors were saturated  .
i took it back and decided to go to bb when i first went into bb my eyes were drawn to this lg , but the sales guy talked me into the samsung 850  .
i took the samsung home and it kept powering off every 2 hours  .
i took the samsung back to swap it out and another sales guy said , oh yeah , we have that proble with these samsungs  .
so i went and spoke to the first bb sales guy and he told me to get the sony 46zx5100 again  .
he swore that i wouldn't have the backlight issue again  .
so , like and idiot , i got another sony  .
sure enough , i is getting the blotchy flashlighting effect  .
so i took it back and told them that i want the tv i is drawn to in the first place  .
before i took the last sony back , i kept it for a week and did research on the lg  .
i even took my xbox 360 into the store and hooked it up to the store model  .
i loved it in the store  .
the 240hz , although not true 240hz , looked just as good as the sony  .
the thing i loved is the colors of the lg and the local dimming  .
b    e    a utiful  .
better color than the sony , the samsung , and the toshiba combined  .
no joke the only concern i had from the reviews is the sound sync issue  .
i called lg before getting the tv and they said that it is a known issue and if i got one that had the problem , then i can call them and they will send me an update for free or i can download it from the internet and flash drive it to the tv  .
so far , i have not had to do this obviously , i am very picky  .
i love this tv  .
i got it for $1399 on sale and in my opinion , that is a steal  .
lg continues to pump out quality products and this is the latest and greatest  .
i rated the sound high because it blows all 4 of the other tvs out of the water  .
yeah , its perfect , but it rocks compared to the others  .
it's also led so it uses less ower than my electric toothbrush  .
i narrowed my search down to 2 tvs that were sitting side by side in bb  .
one is a samsung led (i am not sure of the model now , but it is on sale for about $1700) and the lg 47lh90 (currently on sale for $1500)  .
in the store both sets looked great , but i probably would have chose the samsung except that it did not have as many input ports / methods as the lg  .
i have a few older tivos which the samsung could not handle  .
it also would be nice to occasionally connect a still or video camera  .
no can do with the samsung so i zeroed in on the lg and researched it on the net  .
reviews were mostly positive with the exception of the audio sync problem  .
i almost gave up on the lg after tying to understand by the problem reading various success and failure stories  .
i went to lg's website to see if any official info is available on the problem  .
i found nothing there , but i did find their phone number  .
i figured it cannot hurt to just ask them about it  .
i talked to a customer service rep there and explained my concerns about buying a tv with audio    sync problems  .
she acknowledged that there is indeed an issue with this set when used in conjunction with some cable boxes  .
they said that the problem has been fixed  .
i asked how i could tell if i is purchasing a set that had the fix in it  .
they said that i could not  .
but if i did have a problem , all i had to do is call them and the fix would be sent free of charge  .
i is concerned if the problem affected hd tivos which used cable cards and they said no  .
i asked again if there is any way to identify whether a tv had the firmware update by displaying the firmware version and again she said no  .
(i found that hard to believe  .
but , i think they gave me the piece of mind i needed to just go ahead and buy the set tomorrow please disregard my 5 star rating as i do not own the set yet  .
probably not fair for the total rating averages , but giving it anything less might also be unfair hope this helps  .
maybe other people can call lg too and confirm my story .
its really worth , i bought it on 09/09/09  .
in this time i watch the sports us open , nfl etc and also watch matrix reloaded movie all are in hd (on the air) , i have only basic cable connection)  .
it is really stunning experience with natural skin tone , natural grass green in the football , with deep black levels in the matrix movie etc  .
the sd channels are really good  .
i played a dvd movie in a non    branded dvd player , but still i didnot miss dvd clarity  .
i also tried laptop    tv with s    video to composite connection , even though the picture looks same as in the laptop  .
iam really satisfied alot  .
this is my second lcd , the first one is phillips lcd which i returned after 3 months of purchase  .
i strongly recommend this .
for $1699 at best buy , i do not see how one could go wrong with this tv  .
sure there is better out there but you are going to pay alot more  .
for me this tv at this price is great and performs as stated  .
i own a samsung 40 lcd and went back to purchase another larger samsung for my living room  .
after two days i returned the samsung led and went with the lg  .
it covered every fault i had with the samsung   poor black ; annoying led side lighting ; glare from any window on its beautiful glass screen and hard to (non techie) set up to get the best picture the lg set is not a pretty led like the samsung but the matte screen works to stop glare  .
it is not as thin , but it allows me to mount it on a tilt mount without worrying that i may break it if i pick the wrong bolt  .
the price drop did not hurt either  .
i have always been disappointed with the samsung's aspect ratio choices (remember i own a 40 ) especially if you go from hd to non hd channels  .
this lg set gives me more choices and i now have a great picture that fills the screen and does not cut off the sides or game scores for both hd and non hd programs  .
the setup is a breeze with the picture wizard    it provides test pictures and you simply move the settings until it matches the picture based on your room conditions  .
never had a clue as to how to white balance before now i am god sound quality from the tv speakers is ok , and it does provide treble and bass adjustments , as well as thx sound and something called clear voice that improves the verbal over the background sounds  .
i lived with it for a week before my new home theatre system came in and it is fine  .
have not had any issues with lip sync  .
which is voiced as a concern for lg sets  .
hd and blue ray is life like and this set does a great job with non hd pictures  .
so if you can find this tv on sale and do not need pip or internet (which is still too clumsy to do on tv's) , then go for it .
agree with the most recent review and responded to his comments .
bottom line is this tv is well    worth the price tag  .
the picture and adjustments will leave you very satisfied  .
i picked up this tv at costco for a very significant savings .
only a samsung un55b7000 rivaled this lg model ; at nearly double the price too  .
lg is really coming on fast , imo ,  .
threatening sony and samsung the companies that get mucho dinero just for their names .
overall it is a great led hdtv .
this television is amazing in terms of picture  .
it's just beautiful  .
turn dejudder off  .
it will annoy you    everything looks like home handicam footage and you cannot watch a minute of a movie without it really getting on your nerves    there's no blur issue with it off  .
dejudder is an evil across the flat panel world , so it's hard to blame anyone for having it , but the default should be off    you can set it to off (from the default low ) under the picture setting in the menu now for the lip sync problem  .
this is a problem that you'll see when you use an hdmi cable from at least certain hd cable boxes  .
mine is a motorola dcx3000 from comcast  .
the sync problem is pronounced  .
it is less so with the component cables but there a bit  .
the fix for this is to go into your cable box settings    for my dvr this is done by keeping the tv on , powering off the box with the button and then hitting menu on the box or remote  .
i then go into other hdmi settings (or something like that) and under audio    switch it from auto or dolby or pass through to pcm audio    this is called l    pcm on my box and that will fix the audio sync problem the other way to address it is to use a receiver / external speakers for your audio  .
if you call lg , they will ask you a bunch of questions and tell you that someone is going to call you to set up an appointment to come with a firmware upgrade and make adjustments that might fix it  .
fine , but in the meantime you're getting gray hairs  .
i came across the pcm audio setting fix on a message board and after using it i wanted to post it here so that others could benefit from it by the way , if you have the same hd dvr as i noted above , i found the manual in pdf on    line with a quick google search updated  .
on dec 14 , 2009  .
i bought this tv and a new ultimate performance thx monster ( i know , i know , i got ripped off) hdmi cable because the monster box said it would be good for 240hz refresh rate  .
do i know if it makes the tv look any better  .
but i look at the hd movies i am watching on cable like the dark knight and i can barely breath  .
i am watching the yanks beat up on the phillies and the 240 hz seems seamless  .
football games look great as well  .
is it possible that the reviews on cnet and users are done with an outdated cable for the specs this tv has  .
i do not know , but sports and action movies are a thing of beauty i have set the calibration as specified by cnet and it looks appreciably better than thx setting which is too dark and drab  .
the only difference is i set the noise reduction level to low instead of off and upped the backlight and brightness a little bit because of the bright room it will be kept in i simply cannot imagine how anyone but the most die    hard videophile would be disappointed with this tv good job lg  .
sound   i originally bought the samsung led 8000 because of some of the negative reviews i have seen about the lh90 , specifically concerning lip sync issues  .
i found out that the 8000 had those issues as well so i exchanged it for the lh90  .
i found that the lip sync is much better with the lh90  .
i called lg and said that there is a little lip sync issue and they mailed me a usb memory stick with an upgrade of the firmware  .
fixed it perfectly picture   in the store the samsung 8000 looked better  .
now that i have had both , the lh90 is much better  .
the colors are very true and the back light is much more consistent with the lg  .
a huge plus is that the lg has a matte finish to its screen and does not reflect light if you are looking at the samsung led and the lg , go with the lg  .
the sound has been fixed and the picture is better .
so i did not save the $40 and buy anything but the best available hdmi cables currently available  .
monster 1000s and the sat service tech comment that he thought it is the best picture he had seen yet  .
is he blowing smoke  .
dunno  .
but it seems as if it is better then any hd set i have seen so far sure i will learn more about this tv and the possible settings but the initial set up is pretty easy , it's just that nosing around the menu i came across more options then i even have a clue as yot as to what they do or if i will even find a need to try them out  .
option for option this set will be bringing the competitions prices down , 47 full hd 1080p full led backlighting 240hz lcd tv all of which is more then intended to bring home with me , along with the total investment being more as well  .
but the lat set lasted near ten years so if this last near that long it will end up being well worth every cent .
i bought this tv partly because of cnet's review , but ran into the 'leaning' problem lg is talking about fixing this one , if they can , but say they wo not replace it even though it's under warrantee .
very nice tv  .
best picture i've seen  .
the audio delay can be bypassed by using an external sound system so it's not an issue with most but still troublesome to know it exists  .
lg says it can be fixed and i am still waiting .
i have this set hung on the wall above the fireplace ~ 8 feet off the ground  .
it is tilted slightly downward and the room is quite bright as i have 14 ft tall windows 90 degrees from the set  .
screen performs well in these conditions during the day  .
however , at night the off angle viewing is not good  .
the screen begins to take on a grayish hue and blooming is readily apparent  .
it is great if you are seated directly perpendicular to the screen , but start to deviate laterally and its performance suffers  .
i have noticed that if i stand on a chair off angle , the image distortion is less noticeable  .
i do not understand this phenomenon because the set is tilted downward to optimize the viewing angle  .
the room is quite large (20 ft x 20 ft) so most of the viewing spots are ~13 away which minimizes the amount one has to tilt one's head upward for viewing  .
i am seriously considering the sony xbr9 series which appears to suffer less from off angle viewing demons  .
it sounds as if the led sets are all displaying this off angle viewing concern .
i have only had this set for little over a week  .
i really like it but the lip sync thing unless fixed will have me exchanging it for something different  .
i will update the review in the near future .
bottom line , the picture is great , but the audio issues are criminal  .
lg is very aware of this problem and is working on a firmware solution (could be 3 or 4 more months as of 9/14/2009) that is not guaranteed to fix the issue  .
they realize that there are a lot of sets out there with this problem but have no recall or solution  .
the lg customer service rep advised that i try to return it to the store before my 30 days are up since they have no set date for the firmware update  .
great , now i have to dismantle and pack up this monster to take it back  .
it seem ridiculous that they have not recalled this product given the number of affected sets  .
it's a shame really , the set has a great picture at a very good price point  .
picture gets 5 stars , but the audio is a big 0 .
i purchased this television over the labor day weekend after reading the reviews  .
i'm using hdmi cables from my verizon fios to tv and i am experiencing lip sync issuers  .
i have had verizon reset my cable box and that did not work  .
i telephoned lg and they walked me through a television reset  .
i spoke with best buy and they showed me how to reset my lip sync setting back to 0  .
none of these worked  .
stilling working on problem  .
updated  .
on sep 28 , 2009  .
as i did some research on line i came to find out this is not all that uncommon of an occurence  .
conveniently for lg it seems to break just after the expiration of their warranty  .
you would think for a tv that costs this much money that a software failure would not require a $500 fix .
got this set and is amazed at the improvement in picture quality compared with a 5 year old dlp  .
noticed straight away a minor lip syncing issue and a more bothersome ghosting effect when characters were moving rapidly  .
called bestbuy geek squad and is told this brand new set needed a firmware update  .
when the geek hooked up the set to perform this action the set died entirely  .
the geek said another function should have been performed and lg gave the wrong advice  .
reported this within 30 days of purchase and now cannot even get someone from bestbuy to discuss it with me , except for the girl who hung up on me  .
take message    bestbuy has not stood behind their sale and a new tv should not need a firmware update .
Don't own it yet but was concerned about audio sync problem so I called LG. See full review.; Don't own it yet but was concerned about audio sync problem so I called LG. See full review.
Picture quality blows you away; Not quite as thin as some of the edge lit models
evrything. I stole it from Sears on a weekend special for $1200. w 2 yrs free financing. Cant get better than that.; it wasn't free.
Perfect picture, perfect colors, awesome anti-blur and anti-judder. Better sound than most flat panels.; So far nothing given that I went through 3 other brands before finding this baby!
Picture is great, controls and adjustments are easy, audio is good.; Plastic bezel seems a little fragile (so far no problems though).
Great picture, detail, depth of color, good performance in a bright room due to matte screen finish.; Poor off angle performance, especially at night. Blooming is quite noticeable at night (see a halo around bright objects).
Great color, deep blacks, matte(ish) screen, more picture adjustments than most people will ever know what to do with. Local dimming LED backlighting.; Not a con to me but it doesn't include ethernet connectivity. Slightly larger bezel than I would prefer.
240 MHZ - True Motion, Backlighting LED for deep black levels, 1080P, Excellent HD quality picture, sound excellent. at 12 feet away...overall an excellent 2009 model that is on sale at Frys at discounted price.; Only flaw is that it doesn't offer Internet hookup and isn't 3D ready (although I didn't want 3D anyway).
Best blacks since plasma; Full Screen LED's (not just around the edge) for improved contrast; picture wizard makes calibration a breeze. Great aspect ratio choices. Price is dropping into normal LCD land.; No PIP and no Internet.
Great product and represents value for money. The picture is great, audio is acceptable (although when using a HDTV you should have a home theater system).; TruMotion (all, not jsut this TV).
Great picture, vivid colors, matte finish to screen, even color; thicker than some other LED's is the only thing, but thats what you get with a full panel LED
picture is great, colors are good, lighting is good day or night.; TV leans to the right. service tech feels the TV is made with too much weight on the right side. TV is connected properly - the unit leans due to it's own weight. LG doesn't seem to have an answer. they want to replace a bracket inside the unit...
Beautiful picture especially after calibration. Blu-ray is life like. Even the non-blu-ray dvd's play excellent on this set. Easy setup with lots of calibration options.; Nothing to date but I've only had the TV for a week.
Picture is great, deep blacks, bright whites. Lots of options to choose from to calibrate to your liking. Screen has a matte finish so there are no glare/reflection issues in a brightly lit room.; Major lip sync issue. Audio lags video anywhere any every channel no matter how you try to tweak it. Sometimes up to 1/2 a second.
Superb picture quality. 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio with the help of back-lit technology is impressive. Deep dark background. No audio sync issue at all. LG really makes the top quality product with reasonable price.; Price dropped days after I bought the unit. I paid $1,399 in April 2010. If you price is below this, you should be happy.
Liked the price point and I liked the quality when the TV was working.; The product apparently has a defect that no one at LG is willing to admit to. Our TV lost it's ability to connect to any input due to a software issue.
Good connectivity, LED technology enables the deep black level, high resolution makes this LED TV great for gaming and movie. I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv for the information on what best HDTV to get for this year.; Off-angle viewing is not very good.
This TV has the best black levels I have ever seen.; Audio / Lip Sync Problem (Audio Delay) using TV speakers that cannot be fixed with a firmware download.. Requires a service technician to come on-site using a 'technicians remote" to install the firmware and make changes to some settings.
Natural Skin Tone, Natural Greenary in the Football Ground, deep black levels in the movie (Matrix Reloaded) even in 720i signal transmission. Best Picture and Great Sound.; I don't see any effect when selecting THX Cinema mode except that I didnot see any other. Even after reading the CNet reviews Cons section, i think a lot to buy this TV. That low level details didnot effect my visual experience.
Deep Black Levels and shadow effects,Sound is the best part of the tv and all the functionality and bluetooth works like a dream, and is much much more affordable price wise as compared to its rival Samsung and Sony here in India.; Only very small issue is there that motion blur doesnot work well in standard def. videos and its hard to make out whether it is on or not even on the highest level possible in the standard definition
Picture and colors blow me away. HD movies, cartoons, video games are beyond ridiculous and almost 3-D looking. Sound is almost good enough without an expensive receiver and speakers. 240 refresh rate seems great w/ top notch monster cable.; Be careful lifting this yourself, No bells and whistles outside a myriad of picture calibration settings. Refresh rate might not be as good as I initially feel it is-time will tell.
Fantastic, wonderful picture! I put in a standard DVD into a blu ray player and it was BREATH TAKING on this set. SO bright and crisp - the avalanche footage felt almost 3-D.; The lip sync problem can be fixed without the firmware update from LG, but it's ridiculous that it exists and that LG customer service don't know the relatively simple fix that I've come across - it caused me some angst.
Everything, this TV is great. I have a sharp clean picture right out of the box. This is my 1st lcd and Iam glad I got this one. My brother bought the Samsung 6000 series and I got this one and they are both fantastic for the price; None that I see yet, set it up today
The picture is amazing! The looks of the tv are awesome and the swivel stand is a nice plus. The deep blacks this tv can produce are really nice and the 240hrz is really nice for playing games!; None that I can find. Maybe it would be cooler if it was thinner? But I dont care about the back or side of my tv... Its ment to look at from the front lol.
When I first fired it up I was concerned and in hopes that when I made the change to digital sat things would change. And it sure did! Everything is clear enough to seemingly be able to lift from the screen. Black is black and motion is very smooth.; Everything about HD is costly. But if you scrimp on the quality of your cables you run a very real risk of not finding yourself satisfied and blaming the TV for the shortcomings.
watch a movie in bluray on this TV and you will see how nice the picture looks. 1080/24 is really nice with the cinema feature, USB port works great for pics or .mp3. great energy saving option. I like the swivel stand. Sound is pretty good.; I really have one con and this may be a deal breaker long term. Lip Sync it out of wack with tv stations. a minor one is the swivel stand is great but also feels like it could break if too much pressure was put on it.
