Pros:. Easy to follow on screen setup, wifi works awesome throughout my home 3 stories, picture &#38; sound quality is wonderful. Easy to operate and no apparent firmware challenges so far.. 
Cons:. The instructions could be a bit more helpful when networking to different servers on the network. Eventually figured it out, just took some patience with on-line research. More video play types would be nice.. 
Summary:. I purchased 2 of these from Costco running on cable internet via wireless with a Netgear WNDR3700 router and have incrediable viewing not matter what I'm watching. Setup was a breeze and when I decided to start completely over on one of the players no problems at all. The features are more than enough for my needs and have not had any of the issues I've read about the BDP-S570. And, just to note this is a true personal opinion and review; as many of us use these reviews in order to make informed decisions concerning products we're looking to purchase. Have a great day!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up plug and play. Great WiFi streaming capabilities. Outstanding DVD upstreaming - 24htz. Have not used the other widgets. Qriocity movies are available cheaper on cable on demand and eventually on netflix. 
Cons:. The parental control is poorly laid out, I have been playing with the setting and have been unable to restrict internet movies. Will try the netflix parental control to see if this helps. The manual is of no help with these settings.. 
Summary:. Highly recommend. Streaming depends on two things your network and the location of the player, moved to top of rack and have head no problems at all with netflix HD streaming.. There are services that test your connection speed like speedtest.net.. 

$$;
Pros:. No Brainer to connect to my wireless network and my Sony Bravia TV but you need to find the "WPS" switch on your router before you begin. Once connected, E-A-S-Y Set up is right. You go Sony! On screen is easy to navigate and loads quick paid $193.. 
Cons:. Sony-Why did you put a "3D" sticker on the front of your unit??? Can I peal it off? There is room on the back for such nonsence.. 
Summary:. Wham, bam, thank you Sony! This is a great product, er now it is after downloading the Firmware. Great picture, easy to use. Netflix subscription is a must with this unit. I opted for the blu ray only delivery for an extra $2. per month. Disregard those reviews about choppy netflix streaming, I have logged many hours with excellent results. Still haven't connected the home theater amp and speakers but will shortly. Until then my Bravia TV never looked and sounded so good! My only gripe is the "3D Created by Sony" sticker placed on the front of the unit, the cool dim blue light when the unit is on is all it needs.. 

$$;
Pros:. ?Wireless works great with my mediocre Verizon router. ?Netflix streams instantly. ?Movie rentals from Amazon stream instantly. ?Unit is fast: start-up, shut-down, etc.. ?DLNA streaming on OSX works great. ?Sony customer service answers the phone quickly. 
Cons:. I read the other reviews and noticed that the only real complaint with this product was the wireless connectivity and its effect on Netflix. I purchased from Best Buy thinking I'd return it if I had these issue. I didn't?it works great!. 
Summary:. I purchased the BDP-S570 because I don't want to pay for cable or satellite service. Via wireless internet, I can purchase or stream for free pretty much any music, movie or TV show with Netflix, Amazon or Pandora.. I'm also a minimalist, so I like the fact that my entire entertainment system involves: a TV with an antenna for local channels, and my BDP-S570?that's it.. I don't have a fancy TV (yet) or much of a Blu-Ray collection?much less 3D films of any kind. But it's good to know I'll be able to accommodate these technologies if and when I adopt them in the future.. My favorite part of this system is something that isn't covered thoroughly by other reviews or product specs at CNET. I'm writing this review because I had to do a lot of research to achieve DLNA connectivity between my BDP-S570 and my Apple MacBook running OSX but once I figured it out, it was relatively easy.. DLNA is a technology that allows you to stream movies, music, and photos from your home computer to your Blu-Ray player.. Here's how to do it: Buy iSedora ($25 from isedora.com) and install on your Mac. Your BDP-S570 will "see" this server (Set-up&gt;Network Settings&gt;Connection Server Settings). Make sure you configure iSedora to stream your stuff as NTSC if you're in the US (the default setting is PAL).. iSedora recognizes lots of file types and transcodes them for your Blu-ray player, but here's how I copied my home DVD collection to my computer:. 1) Download MacTheRipper (free). Install it and start it up, put a DVD in your computer, click "GO!", and it will copy your DVD to your desktop.. 2) Download HandBrake (free). Install it and start it up. Choose the VIDEO_TS folder that MacTheRipper put on your desktop as the "Source". I use the "iPhone &#38; iPod touch" output settings because they look fine on my TV and the exported movie is only around 500GB. If you have a fancy TV consider a different setting. Click "Start" to export.. 3) HandBrake will put a MOVIENAME.m4v file on your desktop. Copy this file into the folder you selected in iSedora to keep your movies in.. 4) When you navigate to "Video" on your BDP-S570, you will see iSedora as a navigation option, and you'll see whichever movies you dropped into the appropriate folder.. You can also play MP3s that you have on your computer. Or view a slideshow of your photos. It's pretty slick.. A final thought: the future of home entertainment is not in DVDs and Blu-Ray discs?everything is going to stream (it already does). This is a great product because it allows you to bridge the gap between all the discs you own today and everything you'll download or stream in the future.. I hope that was helpful..

Pros:. Can't beat the price. Easy to set up. I have watched HD movies streamed from Netflix without a problem and I am using a 800.11g router hooked up to the BDP-S570 wirelessly. Discs load and play instantly. Save$200+. Forget the Samsung BD-C5900. 
Cons:. None , except that I have to wait a few months for the 3D firmware to be available, but then again, there is a dearth of 3D material available and the 3D ready HDTV's are too expensive right now.. 
Summary:. Cost less that $200. Easy set up. Out of the box to Netflix HD streaming was 20mins. Seamless Netflix HD streaming. Compact design.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick boot up time. Wireless built in. Plays YouTube, Netflix, etc.. Smaller foot print. Future proof with 3D capability. 
Cons:. Construction seems more flimsy than the first generation players. Power, Eject, and other buttons are micro-sized on the player and difficult to see.. 
Summary:. Very happy I upgraded. My first generation Blu-Ray Disc player would take 1-2 minutes to turn on/boot up, 1-2 minutes to load the disc, and up to 1 minute to get to the main menu. That's five minutes just to watch a movie. Even after the firmware updates, it was clear, that the first generation BD players were beta.. However, this player covers all the gripes. Fast boot up time (you can set it in a super quick standby mode). The discs load almost instantly. Overall, about as fast as a standard DVD player for DVD's.. The built in wireless is a great feature. It plays YouTube, Netflix (not tested), and other stuff straight from the player. I found Sony had a whole bunch of Michael Jackson music videos available to watch for free.. Sony definitely made some much needed improvements in their Blu-Ray Disc players. This player is reasonable priced and works great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast loading. Compact size (just like a good old dvd player). WiFi.. 
Cons:. None. I only use it to play Blu-rays, sometimes DVDs. I'm really into the internet streaming business.. 
Summary:. SONY has finally redeemed themselves. Not only is it the fastest player with WiFi and 3D support (not that I care for that feature a whole much, but good to be a future ready) for under $250, it is simply a steal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent 3D Internet/Wi-Fi Blu-ray player. Setup was fast &#38; logical. Firmware updates were completely automated. Netflix works perfect. Zero problems with streaming the movies. It doesn't get any better than this. Low prices right now too.. 
Cons:. If you have average level experience with Wi-Fi setup and selecting the setup options for the various operating modes, you will have little or no problems. However, I can see that a complete novice would need a little more documentation &#38; help.. 
Summary:. All of the bad reviews of the past caused me to hesitate over this purchase. Seeing the more recent positive reviews let me feel it was OK to buy. Using the various media sources like Netflix is simple and logical. We have now watched 10 Netflix movies without experiencing one single hesitation or flaw of any kind. Very smooth high quality streaming. DVD and Blu-ray display quality is excellent. I would not hesitate to buy again. Very fast Blu-ray DVD loading. Strongly recommend this machine to any user. Just do as others have said and perform the firmware and software updates that Sony will guide you through before attempting to use the unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price. Features. Speed. Streaming Media. Built in WiFi. 
Cons:. Cheap feel of the remote. 
Summary:. I am very pleased with the Sony BDP-S570. It was very simple to set up. I have been streaming Netflix with absolutely no problems. Maybe the initial Netflix issues have been rectified via updates? I use a wired network connection, so I don't know how the wireless networking works.. I like the many extras - lots of different services available for streaming. I don't think this player can be beat for the $200 I paid for it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blows my last bluray out of the water and it was a good panasonic player,but colors "POP" more.. very fast load and play times,too many great options to list ...just a great product!. 
Cons:. NONE buy it!. 
Summary:. I just can't say enough good things about this player...have not seen a better one to date yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Load speed of discs and streaming content. Easy setup. User Interface. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. I just bought this yesterday and spent about 4 hours playing with it. Very easy to set up, with an elegant interface that is very responsive. I also spent a lot of time loading Netflix movies to test, and I think the firmware upgrade that was downloaded must have corrected the streaming problems. I am connected through WIFI, and I did not experience a single hiccup in the video stream, nor did I notice any quality issues. The image was very sharp, particularly on HD content. Sounds like Sony released this puppy a bit too soon, but luckily the firmware update has corrected it.. The wireless was very easy to set up, and connected without a hitch. I do plan to connect to my router directly to test the difference in quality between the wireless and wired connections.. I was also able to connect to Pandora and a bunch of the other services that CNET said were still pending at review time. Note that the Pandora interface is fairly limited, without many of the controls and options of the web interface, but that isn't a problem as you can manage your stations and the player will load those up easily, much like Netflix.. All in all I'm extremely happy with the s570.. 

$$;
Pros:. LOADS DISCS QUICKLY AND HAS GREAT VIDEO QUALITY, NETFLIX STREAMS PERFECTLY, WITH NO HICCUPS AT ALL, EVERYTHING FUNCTIONED FLAWLESSLY, SONY MUST HAVE FIXED ISSUES. INCLUDES FEATURES LIKE PANDORA, AMAZON VIDEO, NPR AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BUILT-IN WIFI.. 
Cons:. NONE AT ALL.. 
Summary:. SAW THIS REVIEW THE OTHER WEEK, TOOK MY GIRLFREIND'S NON-WIFI PANASONIC BACK TO COSTCO AND PURCHASED THIS SONY BDP-BX57 INSTEAD (COSTCO'S MODEL #) BUT IDENTICAL TO THE S570. WHICH MADE HER ROKU OBSOLETE. WE BOTH ARE TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY BY HOW COOL THIS PLAYER IS. THE SETUP AND WIFI HOOKUP WERE A COMPLETE BREEZE, NETFLIX LINK-UP WAS EASY TOO. BOUT TIME THE MANUFACTURERS ARE GETTING THEIR STUFF TOGETHER. I MEAN, HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THEIR MODEM NEXT TO THEIR TV? BUY THIS PLAYER IF YOU WANT BLU-RAY, NETFLIX AND WIFI ALL IN ONE.. Updated. on May 27, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Works right out of the box. Easy setup and navigation. Looked at PS3 as well. This product one on price. Plus, my Harmony One will only control the PS3 with the purchase of a $100 dongle. That was the deciding factor. This player is fast and clean.. 
Cons:. None really. Maybe a Google app would have been nice. However, I havent explored all the apps that came with it.. 
Summary:. Very impressed. Priced right. Ease of use. The Netflix app is awesome! Cant wait to learn all the others. Old school film to DVD's are even clearer than my regular Panasonic unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays SACD. 
Cons:. Lower-quality Netflix streaming.. 
Summary:. I bought the first Sony Blu-Ray-player but had to buy a second DVD player for my many SACDs.. The main review says: "It also offers support for the niche high-resolution audio format SACD, which is a step up over most competing players at this price level and a nice perk if you still have some of those discs in your collection. However, if you've got a large library of SACD and DVD-Audio discs, Oppo's Blu-ray players are still your best bet.". Mainstream reviewers constantly imply that SACD is an obsolete format.. It may be, in the pop music world; but classical music collectors have a wide variety of new SACDs to choose from. The surround sound is mostly used to create a sense of the performing space, and the higher resolution to recreate the sound of the instruments more accurately.. Jordi Savall's Alia Vox label seems to issue all of its new releases in SACD, including re-releases of older material. Fanfare magazine reviews about 40 new SACDs in every issue.. Try typing "SACD" into Amazon's search engines. You'll find thousands of SACDs currently in stock. Most of the ones that pop up first are classic rock and jazz, but adding "SACD" to your favorite classical compositions may bring up multiple recordings. There are EIGHT competing SACD recordings of Mahler's Symphony no. 8, only one of which is listed as "discontinued.". If you're looking for electric guitars to swirl around your head, you may be frustrated; but if you want to be plunged into the aural space of a Gothic cathedral, SACD is the way to go. Many European labels readily available in the U.S. regularly issue new SACDs.. Come on, reviewers; drop the "SACD is dead" mantra.. Paul Brians. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything!. 
Cons:. Nothing compared to other BluRay players!. 
Summary:. I just love the Blu-Ray player! Its got new features making other BluRay players to step up their game! Get them Sony!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up. Super fast loading. Built in WiFi. Netflix streaming. Dolby True HD/DTS Master Audio. Excellent Blue Ray image equal to PS3. 3-D Ready. Slim size (1 3/4 inches tall). Reasonable price.. 
Cons:. Extremely small controls on unit. Must turn on lights to locate.. 
Summary:. Upgraded from the BDP 300, which had problems with loading blue ray movies (several minutes) and would occasionally shut down during a br movie. Not the S570. This unit has all the features I need. No major complaints. Purchased at Best Buy for $249 + tax. Blue ray movies are visually outstanding.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast setup. Completely idiotproof. True Sony style.. 
Cons:. None. None. I love this unit so far.. 
Summary:. Unit is set up on a Samsung 50 inch Plasma from 2006 (720p or 1080i, not full 1080p HD) and I chose to use the WiFi rather than a hard Cat 5 network cable. Just being lazy and happy to try that out first.. Let's start from the case of the unit. I was interested in a Samsung, but hate the fact that there is usually a front flap that first goes down to then get to the DVD drawer or carriage. Samsung also has their touch-sensitive buttons on the top, which I am not too keen on. On the back of all that, I have read way too many reviews of user's having issues with the Samsung units, which I do find surprising and I feel that despite being Korean, Samsung makes quality products.. Now for the Sony unit. I stopped in Best Buy to have a look at what they had and saw the new Sony BDP-S570. It looked to be everything I was looking for. A better built in WiFi (no dongle like Samsung offered), no front cover to open to get to the DVD drawer, normal buttons on the unit, upgradable to 3D in the future with another firmware update, etc. This was a super easy and fast to setup (took about 15 minutes, not including dropping the HDMI cable through the wall with the rest of my cables), and the best of all, the menu system is set up like the typical Playstation 3 and PSP, so if you are familiar with those, you will see how intuitive the menu system is. The first thing I did after setup was to check for the firmeware updates, which it right away indicated there was a new version, so I updated that. When it finsihed, the unit turned off and when I turned it back on, the DVD player home screen menu was flashing on my TV. I thought I killed it. After I turned it back off and then on again, all seemd ok. I check the firmware again, and it said it was up to date. Now for the real fun. I threw a BluRay disk in the unit that I have from the PS3 and I couldn't believe my eyes. Everything looked just as good as the DVD did on the PS3 (which remember is probably the best BluRay player out there), which I have on a full 1080p HD LCD tv. WOW. Then after that, I started playing with all the online web-based applications and features. Everything accesses real quick using the WiFi and comes in great.. I went out with some friends for the night and mentioned the unit and told everyone I give this machine an A++++ rating and would highly recommend it.. Well done Sony!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture quality = amazing, I really could not ask for more out of this product. Highly noticeable difference from watching upscaled dvds on my xbox 360.. Sound = very noticeable on my tv speakers.. Load time = Pretty quick , cant complain.. 
Cons:. I didnt like the remote as much ? Felt really lite and almost cheap? its not a harmony...... Gets the job done.. 
Summary:. I am watching on a 2 year old model LG 47LG60 and I have noticed a problem with action scenes while it is in 120hz mode. This Bluray player completley fixed that very annoying " for me " problem. When i bought my tv the picture alone on it stood out from all of the rest , even the bravia's. I can definitely tell the difference in everything about Iron Man 2. I just bought this player tonight as a matter of fact , install took literally 10 minutes. I am a videophile. The wifi ?. SIMPLE, I run everything internet wired due to being a gamer but decided that until I get a reciever with surround pandora isnt such a high demand as of yet " planning to but the reciever in a couple days ". Its hard for me to imagine anyone having problems connecting this device to the internet. As i mentioned I am a avid gamer. I have only set up 1 pc for wireless and that was 6 years ago, all I did was go into my router , turn the wireless on , than i wrote my wep password down and set it up in the player. Instantly connected. The patch patched very fast , maybe 3 minutes maximum.. The sound ?. I am currently using the television speakers due to my previous surround failing. It sounded alot better , I cant lie. I am excited about getting the full surround !!. I am writing this after watching 1 bluray movie on it. I tend to buy products that has a decent cnet stamp of approval , yet what mainly influences my decision is consumer feedback so i feel as if I owe the general public my experience with this product. I have not test any of the internet options as of yet. Im planning on watching another movie and checking that out tomorrow. If I have any real problems or I feel as if something is a "deal breaker" I will write another post and explain in full the problems. Im not too worried about it though , as with anything mass produced you are goign to have your lemons and bad batches. Most problems with eletronics are fully the product or the consumer. I tend to ignore reviews that seem to be the consumers lack installation skills, but i also make sure there isnt hundreds of D.O.A products going out , or faulty products with deal breaking glitches. Well im off to watch the other movies , thanx for reading. If you are looking for a great Bluray player you can not go wrong with this. Its everything i expected/hoped it would be..

Pros:. netflix streaming!. 
Cons:. no hard drive. 

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding picture quality and very fast load times. Netflix streaming is better than other players i have. Pandora and Slacker work Flawlessly. DLNA streaming from my pc also works great, Overall this player does everything it advertises.. 
Cons:. Setup and register to activate some features can take some time. must update firmware to get all the features.. 
Summary:. I did alot of research before buying this player, and after the firmware updates came out for the sony the price was right. Overall i am very pleased with the video and music streaming of this player. recent updates have fixed any of the issues with DLNA and Netflix and i really like sonys GUI interface, it just seems faster than some ive used. Also the lack of any front panels makes more sense(nothing to break) sleek styling and very fast load times along with all the streaming features make this the best Blu-ray player Ive owned (Out of 3). 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful Blu-Ray with quick start. Easy to set up. WiFi works great. Lots of internet media options. Netflix streams in HD now that I got a new 802.11n router. Quality was poor with 802.11g router. The menus are simple and easy to navigate.. 
Cons:. Seems a little touchy about the router you use. Had I not had to chase an X-Box live issue I would not have solved the Netflix issue.. 
Summary:. A great Blu-Ray player with excellent WiFi media streaming. I paid $198 for this item and could not be happier with the end result. I was initially very disappointed with the poor quality of Netflix streaming. My son just got a new X-Box 360 and was having issues with the wireless. I finally bought a new router (Belkin Dual Band 802.11n) and that solved both the X-Box Live issues and the Netflix issue. As I write this I am watching "Taxi Driver" in beautiful HD streaming on a 73" screen. I tried to watch it with the old router and it was unwatchable. The user interface is easy enough and all of the setup was simple. My Mitsubishi TV recognized the BR player and programmed the remote automatically so I have not used the Sony remote since the initial setup. Do not let the poor Netflix reviews scare you. You just need to get your wireless network up to snuff. I checked download speeds before and after the router change and it was 6.75mps with both routers. However both the BDP-570 and the X-Box work much better now. I did do a firmware update out of the box and another a couple of days later. That was a painless process over WiFi. It is possible that the second firmware update fixed the Netflix issue. I did the update after setting up the new router but prior to trying Netflix with it. This is a nice little piece of technology that works very well. I would recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightning fast loads, super easy set-up, no picture freeze issues (as of now), wi-fi set up a breeze, fast stable updates, beautiful picture. Machine intuitively knows many optimal set-up configurations and sets them as default.. 
Cons:. Could do without the exposed USB port at the front, but that's a quibble.. 
Summary:. I purchased a Samsung player and had nightmarish problems with picture freezing, sound drop-outs, wi-fi connections, updates. You name it, this machine blew. My new Sony kicks that machine to the curb and puts a smile on my face that still hasn't left. I couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast Disc load-time. Great quality picture and sound. Amazon movies.. 
Cons:. Netflix streaming not perfect. Front controls laughably small.. 
Summary:. I've had the S570 for almost a week and am overall very pleased with it. Some thoughts.. 1) The quality of the picture and sound is every bit as good as my older Samsung 2550.. 2) The load time of bluray discs in this unit is amazing. It's super-fast from the time you put the disc in to the time you get an image on the screen. My "Dark Knight" disc used to take 1-1/2 minutes to load. Now it's less than half the time. Standard Def discs are on the screen sooner than I can sit on the couch after leaving the player.. 3) There is a slight skip once the disc starts up. You lose a half a second of the opening part of the content. Seeing that it's usually the Studio logo it's not too much of a problem.. 4)User interface. Way too cluttered with material that you'll never use, but it's still fairly intuitive and the menus are very responsive to the remote and move quickly.. 5) Internet streaming of movies. Before buying I had read that the streaming is unreliable and gets snagged. I have had this happen a couple of times (I'm on an "N" network), but I haven't been watching enough streaming content to judge whether this is a persistent problem. Amazon is a very welcome addition. Good selection and some relatively cheap movies available.. 6) Front controls on the unit are way too small. Not a huge problem because I use the remote more often, but a questionable choice by Sony.. Have to say I'm very pleased with the S570. Lightning fast load times, good quality picture and sound, and a choice of streaming internet content.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up. Fast Loading. Wonderful Picture. Great Audio (Optical out to HK AVR435 7.1 with a sub). Clean look. FAST Hookup. 
Cons:. Netflix runs really mixed. For example, 43 minutes of No Reservations will pause several times and the view pixalated.. Scantuary streams all the way through with no problems... ***?. The other thing I hate are all the for $ services they push.. 
Summary:. This really made the leap to blu ray comfortable and I LOVE streaming the netflix (when it works well).. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast BlueRay startup and playback, many streaming options both audio and video, excellent video output. The streaming works fine other than no surround channel as listed below under cons.. 
Cons:. No Dolby 5.1 surround with Netflix streaming. Netflix streams either STD def movies in stereo or HD movies in Dolby 5.1. Both play back fine (no choppiness) but no surround in the HD ones.. 
Summary:. I would buy it again. I really hope Sony updates the firmware with additional NetFlix fixes. I just purchased the player this past weekend and I used the network to update with the latest firmware so it is current as of Sunday 7.18.10.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick load time, nice design, great image quality, easy set-up, great value for blu-ray with upgrade to 3D. 
Cons:. Video streaming quality, video streaming quality, video streaming quality....... get it?. 
Summary:. This player is sleek, easy to set up, and loads quickly. All in all, its a great value for blu-ray.. However, there are serious problems with the streaming media. We have tried to use both Netflix and Amazon, over wireless and with an ethernet connection, and the streaming leaves much to be desired. Last night, we had to stop and re-start the machine 9 times during an 100 minute movie - talk about ANNOYING!. Here are the problems - if the media stream isn't fast enough, then the player freezes. In order to re-start the player, you need to press stop, go back to the main menu, wait 30 seconds, order the movie again, and wait for it to load again. We tried to remedy the problem by starting the movie, pressing pause for ten minutes to allow a significant part of the file to store in the cache, and then begin viewing it again. This helped, but it is really annoying to have to do that.. My solution is actually a software solution. The player does have on-board memory, and you can easily add more memory by tacking on a USB drive. Sony should reprogram the software so that you can click "order" on a movie and then choose to either view it immediately (direct streaming) or download into the cache (without automatically playing the movie), allowing you to play it once the file is completely downloaded (for example, if you "rented" the movie, it would be in the cache for 24 hours, if you bought the movie, it would be there until you deleted it, etc.). This would prevent freezing and make the viewing experience much more enjoyable.. If Sony offered a solution like then then I would say this is the best product ever - so get to work Sony engineers!. And ditto on the comment below regarding the remote control. It leaves a lot to be desired, but this isn't an issue for me for two reasons: go buy the Logitech universal remote, or use the iPod/iTouch App to link to the player (works great!)..

Pros:. Fast blu-ray loader. Very easy firmware update. Wi-fi and wired to the network and internet. Plenty of Wedges including Slacker and Pandora Radio. Low cost. 
Cons:. Avg up convert DVD picture. Cheaply constructed. Some features missing that's in other players. Few connections in back. 
Summary:. This is a great bargain for those that's looking for a new and faster hot rod. This player loads many times faster then my Samsung BDP 1400. I was very shocked at the load speed difference. That alone is enough to want this player. The unit User Interface is setup just like all the latest Sony products, if you have a Sony Playstation, PSP or Bravia then you know what to expect. This unit come with a very easy to setup Wi-fi and wired internet connect. You can connect to Sony's Style where you can play your Slacker, Pandora and many more wedges right from your player. The unit has all the basic connections in back including HDMI, optical audio and RCA video and audio, but that's it, don't expect many more high ended inputs, because you won't get them with this until. It does have a USB jack in the front for pictures, audio and video, that's very handle to have. It does play most of the more popular formats, but doesn't do AVI, or MKV.. The players buttons are on a lip on the front of the unit, it's hard to read specially if it's dark in the TV room, it would have been nice if the buttons were pointing forward not up. This is a very minor grip because the remote work fine, though you can't read it during a dark movie, and there isn't a light on it. Though it has very basic features, this unit is fast, and that's what I wanted. Also a plus for some, it's 3D enabled, for people with the itching to get into 3D TV watching. I'm not one of them, but nice to see it's there in case I change my mind later.. I highly recommend this unit, especially for replacement unit like I was..

Pros:. Wi-fi - having a movie player "connected" to the rest of the world is awesome.. Fast load times - its not as fast as a dvd player but its very close. Small design - my older blu ray player feels like a mainframe computer by comparison. 
Cons:. Every service it provides isn't up and running... yet.. 
Summary:. I really like this blu ray player. I mainly chose it because it can connect to Netflix and it has wi-fi and it all works flawlessly for me. My entire setup is all Sony and the player design matches the other components. In the dark all the lights on the TV, the blu ray player and receiver match up..

Pros:. Terrific Picture Quality, Awesome Sound Quality, Easy Wireless Set up, Solid design, logical remote, very fast start up, I like the horizontal/vertical menu system once you get used to it.. 
Cons:. Netflix and Amazon streaming capability a little spotty, picture quality is so-so. Internet streaming gives strange sounds from my rear center speaker; Lacks a zoom feature, so if the movie is in letterbox, that's how you'll watch it, like it or not. 
Summary:. I thinks this will be one of the best players in its price range once Pandora and DNLA streaming are added via firmware upgrade. I'd like to see Sony add Cinema Now to its internet channel line up, but the awesome picture quallity and sound makes up for having to wait. And then of course, there's 3-D which no player in this price range has. So I'd have to say this is a winner in terms of performance, features, design and price. I recommend this player.. 

$$;
Pros:. wi-fi; on-board decoding; Sony smooth exterior style; numerous display and sound options; numerous internet content links; good remote; fantastic picture and sound. 
Cons:. UI confusing at first; still slow startup to me; tiny buttons on unit. 
Summary:. I replaced an older Toshiba DVD with this new one I found at a local BB. Easy setup mostly, once I figured out their strange UI: content goes horizontal; settings vertical. Well except for extra special settings which are in the content area. A bit wacky. Just navigating to web content puts me in the same menu as changing product settings. Weird, but easily used once I figured it out.. Wifi setup was not so straight forward to find and complete, but worked first time and is solid. Some content access requires registration on Sony's site, but that's not surprising.. I wanted it for BD bennies, which are awesome. Improved sound decoding really apparent on my higher end HT. And we're NetFlix junkies, so download queue played great. Same with Amazon, YouTube and the rest of the web video content.. Logitech has it loaded so I was able to update my universal remote pretty easily, replacing the old Toshiba DVD.. I must admit it feels strange accessing all that via my DVD player vs. just play a disc but hey-- It works and works great.. Just hire a new UI design team next time to separate out player settings from content in a more obvious manner.. 2012 cranked up looked and sounded excellent on the big plasma. Happy so far!. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well with other HDMI components (tv/reciever), easy to use, good netflix and dvd playback, great BD Live support.. 
Cons:. has locked up a couple of times requiring the power to be disconnected, streaming from a windows home server doesn't work well, poor wi-fi reception had to switch to wired to get netflix hd to work acceptable.. 
Summary:. has improved with each sony update, expect further updates to improve the whs streaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price point, built-in Wi-Fi, quick to start (even without quicker start feature enabled), simple remote, automatically changes Input on qualified Sony television to the connection of the player, fairly straight-forward navigation. 
Cons:. Wi-Fi okay (but haven't used it enough to really pass judgment-see bottom-line summary), a bit small (in terms of fitting in with other audio/video components, user manual fairly useless beyond initial set-up. 
Summary:. Purchased at Costco as the BDP-BX57 (included HDMI cable). Confess that the purchase was made in no small part to take advantage of the Netflix streaming option. We had discussed other options (e.g. Roku, etc.), but going with a Blu-Ray player that included streaming services seemed more logical.. We are very satisfied with the device as a Blu-Ray and/or DVD disc player. It worked well right out of the box and while the menu system might seem a bit strange to many, it is quite comfortable to those (like us) who have been borrowing their child's Sony PS3 to watch Blu-Ray discs.. Physical set-up was as simple and straight-forward as it can be, but there were some hiccups and confusion regarding some of the other set-up parameters. Linking to our Wi-Fi router was both simple and painless, but I was surprised to discover that I would have to visit a Sony web site to link our Pandora and Slacker accounts to the device before we could stream. I had imagined all would be handled directly through the player itself. Regardless, we managed to have everything up and running within an hour, which I consider to be a success by any measure.. One feature I really like, even though it's rather tiny, is that when the player is turned on it will automatically switch our recent-model Sony LCD television to the appropriate input for the player.. Of the discs (both Blu-Ray and DVD) we have watched thus far we have been very, very pleased with the overall picture quality. I'm certain it must have its issues (as illustrated in the CNET review), but for this casual movie watcher the experience, especially in HD, is simply phenomenal.. Regarding the Wi-Fi and streaming video from Netflix, we have only done so once thus far (with the latest firmware installed as of late August 2010) and found the stream quality to be less than what we had anticipated. Overall quality wasn't up to the standard I had expected and we did experience one drop-out near the end of the movie, which required us to restart it and then fast-forward to the appropriate location.. I will add a reply to this review in the future when we have watched more streaming content via Netflix.. Lastly, regarding the streaming of music via Pandora and Slacker. While I do not recall the exact particulars for Slacker, I checked with Pandora regarding the quality of the streaming to what are called "in-home devices" as opposed to a web browser connection. The news wasn't good. Even though the player is connected to the stereo (which sounds much better than my pretty good computer speakers), Pandora's API only supports something like 64kbps streaming to in-home devices, even with a paid account (as opposed to 192kbps for a paid account when streamed through your web browser). I seem to recall that Slacker wasn't much different regarding the streaming quality to an in-home device.. To be frank, I was rather surprised to learn this information and even more disappointed. I had hoped to use the Pandora account via the A/V receiver for the better sound quality, but that appears to be pretty pointless now. The folks at Pandora did indicate that they hope to offer higher bit-rate quality audio to in-home devices in the future. As to when that is... ?. 

$$;
Pros:. Well-made unit with excellent speed (for Blu-Ray) loading/searching/etc. Nice BR video/audio quality. USB port not behind drop-down door on front of unit (and a 2nd USB port on unit's backside). Eject button returns with this model; stable WiFi.. 
Cons:. (1) Very poor Netflix streaming video quality - jerky/choppy that, at times, renders it nearly unviewable.. (2) Primitive remote of inferior quality; no backlightling, with a cheap/flimsy feel.. (3) Very painful to enter alphanumberics for WiFi setup.. 
Summary:. I strongly suggest you buy the Sony BDP-S570 (aka BDP-BX57) from a warehouse store that allows returns without restocking fees, if you have any interest in using Netflix for streaming video. The unit has exceptionally poor Netflix streaming video quality - jerky/choppy that, at times, renders it all but unviewable. Unit behaves as if bandwidth-limited on 2 independent DSL connections (DirecTV and ATT) - either when hardwired or using WiFi. Streaming the very same video, at same time, onto a laptop does not reveal any of these "bandwidth" problems however, and strongly suggests the "problem" lies with Sony's Netflix interface rather than either of my DSL connections. Amazon.com videos stream without problem on the BX57. Other reviewers have reported similar Netflix streaming video problems with the BDP-S570 / BDP-BX57. I stepwise lowered the BX57's display resolution from 1080p to 480i, and even tried allowing my 2009 Samsung 120Hz LCD TV to handle the HD processing (instead of the BX57), but all to no avail.. When I contacted Sony's Tech Support by phone I was told they are "unaware of any such Netflix streaming video problems" - which seems unlikely, unless they are prohibited from accessing the internet. Sony Tech Support also expressed no interest whatsoever in examining unbiased reviews with regards to choppiness/jerkiness of streaming Netflix videos, like those available on CNET.com for the BDP-S570 that noted "subpar Netflix streaming video quality". Thus, at the current time, Sony has no plans to issue a firmware flash to fix the problem (or even if such a fix might be possible). I purchased my BDP-BX57 from Costco a couple of weeks ago and will return the unit if Sony does not issue a firmware fix within the next couple of months.. 

$$;
Pros:. Industrial design, remote, BD and DVD picture quality all top notch.. Setup was painless. Wifi and Ethernet both work great.. 
Cons:. Netflix streaming needs work. The CNET editors' review understated how bad it is.. 
Summary:. [Setup: Sony KDL-52W4100, HDMI connection.]. This is a great BD player. My only complaint is the Netflix streaming picture quality. Unacceptably jerky at 1080p and 720p. Eventually I discovered that it's actually much better at 1080i. (That's the only reason that I didn't return it and get the LG instead.). Sony could help here if the Screen Settings did something more sensible for Netflix streaming: when "Output Video Format" is set to "Original Resolution", it does what you'd expect for BD and DVD (1080p and 480p, respectively), but Netflix is still at 1080p. If it would automatically change to 1080i for Netflix, that would save me the hassle of having to remember to dive down into that menu to switch between the two. (That would've earned an extra "star" from me.). 

$$;
Pros:. This slim little player makes your adjacent cable box look like a dino. Quiet and understated. Powering on the unit reveals the X-bar interface. Its all very intuitive. The Wireless-N implementation works great on my WPA/AES network.. 
Cons:. 1. No DLNA/UPnP till July. Read the fine print folks.. 2. USB thumb/flash and disk based drives must be formated FAT32. If it supported NTFS or XFS or ANYTHING frankly besides FAT32, this would be a media center crusher.. 
Summary:. It may be 3D ready but who really cares. I bought mine for a few reasons: (1) price at sub $250, and (2) integrated networking. What I got was a pleasent surprise. It's sometimes fun to by the superior product and not be drewling over the neightbors latest gadget. Join me, will you? It may play DVD/BluRay discs but I'm still having too much fun with NetFlix to even care. Excellent job Sony.. Updated. on Jul 25, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluray's load Fast, Unit produces a sharp picture. 
Cons:. Netflix performance is unacceptable. 
Summary:. This unit does not connect to the Netflix website. It goes to a Sony site that acts as an intermediary between Netflix and the Bluray player. Its works great at 2 in the afternoon. At 7 pm, when traffic is high, - it makes the movie unwatchable. We have a wireless laptop, several desktops, and Xbox 360 that all work fine with Netflix. Its definitely not a network issue. Mine is going back.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good blu-ray disc fast playback. 
Cons:. I have 2 BDP-S570's and 2 Insignia blu-ray wi-fi players.. The Insignia has much better quality Netflix streaming.. I tried hooking my Sony's up with the ethernet cable and the Netflix had no change from wi-fi.. 
Summary:. Don't buy it, if you want the best quality Neflix picture. Very dissapointed in the Sony streaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality of DVDs on HDTV much better than with DVD player. 
Cons:. WIreless connection impossible. 
Summary:. The upcoding of DVD signal produces a very crisp image on HDTV as compared to a DVD player. Discs which had some areas that would not play properly on older DVD unit (due to damage or defect) played well. Wireless function is absent; unit reports that it has successfully connected to wireless router but not internet; router does not detect player. All settings on player and router are correct, and both have newest firmware, still no function.. 

$$;
Pros:. beautiful picture, lots of streaming options, great sound when it works. 
Cons:. I tried two players-both suffered from drop outs in sound when the player got warm(even in an open environment. The remote is basic, ugly, and hard to see in the dark. It couln't see MP3 files on a burned disk. 
Summary:. Due to the sound issue this player seems to have Im back to looking for a great player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Haven't really used the product yet; still setting it up. Like that it has 3D capability (future proofing), DLNA (awaiting firmware), and Internet. Given Sony was the developer of Blu-ray, I'm hoping the Blu-ray picture is first rate.. 
Cons:. Don't know if others have had this problem. Hope it can be fixed. Hard to understand why it would happen, but I have now confirmed multiple times and can say definitively, the player somehow shuts off the wireless feature of my router.. 
Summary:. Waiting to see if I can get it to work.. 

$$;
Pros:. haven't really used it. 
Cons:. it just is incredibly problematic in connecting to my wireless internet, and I am a microsoft partner and very knowledgable..... 
Summary:. think i will reallyt like it if it ever connects to the internet. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool Features.. 
Cons:. I am having similar problems with WiFi. Everytime I turn on Sony Blu Ray it disablles wifi. Anyone have any ideas on what to do?. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast performance, excellent picture &#38; sound quality, easy setup. 
Cons:. Reloads/buffers incessantly while streaming Netflix. 
Summary:. If CNET reviewers had to take this unit home and use it, I guarantee it would not get four stars. It's possible that some units are flawed, but judging by the frequency of complaints about streaming problems, it would have to be a LOT of them. I really wanted to make the BDP-S570 work, even to the extent of hard wiring my network connection, but it was not possible. The picture is awesome; so is the operational speed. But Netflix just won't work well even after applying multiple fixes, fiddling with settings (set noise reduction to zero, manually set IP addresses, etc) and even connecting via ethernet cable to my network (cable modem &#38; Dlink DIR655 router). The S570 will start reloading and often will do that about every 30 seconds once it starts. After days of working with it, finally found out it wasn't a WIFI issue by running a hard wire to the network - same problem. It could be that Netflix has bandwidth problems during peak times, but other players don't have this much difficulty, so save yourself the headache and buy something else. Also, the Sony Netflix browser is sub-par, only allowing you to see your Watch Instantly Queue, and the movie icons are so small that you have to select each one to see what it is. Traded for the LG BD570, it works great right out of the box, no streaming problems at all. I can live without 3-D.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has an amazing picture quality, good sound system. Disk runs smoothly.. 
Cons:. Wanted to see pictures from an external hard disk, it threw the message "USB device connected to the front panel is not supported". Contacted the support team, they could not provide me help, the call was terminated halfway.. 
Summary:. I purchases Sony BDP-S570 about a month back. We played a bluray disk on this player. The quality was just amazing. We did not try the 3d features as we did not have a 3d TV. Connecting to wireless network is very simple. When you connect to youtube, it did make some some noise, initially I suspected if it was a background noise. I saw the same clip on my laptop and did not her any background noise. We have started exploring other features like connecting an external hard disk player to see some pictures. We found a message USB device connected to the front panel is not supported". Connected another external hard disk player and found the same message. I tried both the hard disk players on my laptop and found that both of them are working fine. I contacted the support center, my chat was abruptly terminated.. I feel pretty bad with the quality of the product and not being able to get support from Sony.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact design, built in wifi. 
Cons:. Not suitable for Netflix. 
Summary:. I bought this with Netflix in mind.. My S570 worked fine for a few weeks. Now it will play Netflix for 5 to 20 minutes, then goes to "Loading" and never recovers until I stop and go back to the menu to select the program and start again. My wifi signal strength is in the low 90% range, occasionally hitting 100%. If I connect my LG player connected with a wifi adapter, there is no problem at all, never stops. So it isn't my Internet connection or wifi issue.. Since I bought this mostly for Netflix, it has to rate as unacceptable.. 

$$;
Pros:. There were no pros discovered. 
Cons:. Will not connect. My other devices connect fine.. 
Summary:. Sony tech support was unable to help, I will not buy from them again.. 

$$;
Pros:. It used to work. 
Cons:. won't play new blu-ray releases. 
Summary:. Here is the key part of my last Sony support session:. Franke_&gt; Based on the information you've provided, I suggest that please wait for the release of the new firmware update.. Dick&gt; That is unacceptable. I paid a premimum price for what I thought was a premium product. Instead I got junk that is obsolete in 2 years.. Franke_&gt; I understand your concern, Sziede.. Dick&gt; How about sony replaces my BDPS300 with a model that works? If I replace it, it will be with a Samsung.. Franke_&gt; Since, at this moment I can only suggest that you wait till the release of the new Firmware Upadate.. Dick&gt; Bul-ray is a Sony standard. The BDPs300 is a sony product. Planed obsolescence is one thing, but screwing customers is bad business.. Dick&gt; This suggestion sucks. And I will say so on every site that reviews electronics.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek. Great quality picture.. 
Cons:. Freezes streaming Netflix...repeatedly. Can't advance on fast forward without it freaking out.. 
Summary:. I am taking it back. 

$$;
Pros:. did not get that far.. 
Cons:. Wireless connectivity to securty enabled router. 
Summary:. Not able to connect to my home wireless network because it has WEP 128bit encryption enabled. Sony support said the unit can only use 25 digits and suggested I change my encryption to 64bit. YOU BET! Tech said that Sony is aware and is attempting to produce a software upgrade.. I Will be retutning this unit!. Updated. on Sep 11, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture.. 
Cons:. Bottom line is the Wireless connection does not work. Was in the middle of an Amazon imported movie and it stopped, froze, i'm returning it based on this and other related review. BTW...my wireless router is about 20 ft from the player.. 

$$;
Pros:. without netflix not worth the price.. 
Cons:. Would not play movies in que. Customer support told me Sony Blu-ray will not play ?copywrited? movies from Netflix. Netflix customer service said issue may be with the Sony box playing Netflix titles and that the copywrite claim was not correct.. 
Summary:. Bought for combination Blu-ray disk and netflix, since will not play consistently Netflix machine will be returned..
