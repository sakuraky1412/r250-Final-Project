i love the canon products they have the best lenses , software , cameras , printers etc cannot say i've been disappointed with any canon product and as a novice photobug canon is the way to go .
this is the undisputed champion of consumer camcorders  .
canon took their time and designed the perfect camcorder  .
and a street price of $750 you cannot beat it , sony's are not nearly as good and they cost $300    $400 more on the street in all my (lengthy) research the only cons i heard mentioned were    .
) why 40gb hdd  .
why would you need more  .
that's between 5  .
5 15 hours  .
when a battery only lasts 1  .
5 hours how many spares would you carry  .
) 24p mode does not work  .
wrong  .
it is perfect  .
those who have issues are using a bad codec which has been identified on some of the well known forums 3  .
) it's not true hd @ 1920 x 1080 , it's really 1440 x 1080i   wrong  .
it's true 1920 x 1080  .
those who claim it's 1440 are using a bad codec application which is limited to 1440 , but the video is actually 1920 x 1080  .
these bad codecs are also the cause of 24p mode not looking good , it's because the codec is trying to run 24p at 29  .
97 thus resulting in tearing get the right codec and all is perfect  .
this is the only camcorder to buy if you are considering a hd level camcorder .
this is the fifth camcorder i have owned , and it is far and away the best  .
great color and sharpness , tons of features , even still pictures are great at 3  .
1 mp  .
the battery life is a bit low but considering the fact it is a hd hdd camcorder , this is not unexpected  .
buy a second battery  .
i love this camera  .
i'm an above    average , tech geek user who makes home movies to dvds  .
i is dying for higher    quality video before my disney world trip this year  .
i've been waiting for a hd hard drive camera that is not sony  .
i love canon quality and optics  .
the video quality is amazing through an hdtv  .
i expect the quality to remain impressive when i make sd dvds the manual says to back the hard drive up periodically and to disconnect it from the pc carefully  .
i get the impression that the hard drive can be touchy and require re    initialization  .
i'll be careful now if my editing software will just support the avchd file format i'll bet set  .
at least until i move to and imac next year i got this for $829 via amazon  .
com in oct , 2006 .
i love this camcorder  .
it is the best you can find for the price and even if it is a thousand bucks , i would still have bought it  .
its best quality is it's user friendly  .
if you are into making movies with your friends as i am and you're just beginning , you are gonna love it  .
plus , you can buy a whole bunch of awesome accessories for this camcorder    microphone , wide    angle lens and a lot of other awesome stuff  .
trust me , i love it and you will love it too .
this has been a great camera for me so far  .
it takes great video and still pictures  .
it's easy to use and compact  .
battery life has been great the biggest frustration i've had is with the avchd video format  .
the software support for this format is limited , but that is not the fault of the camera  .
also , for some reason , you have to have an sd card to take still pictures  .
i do not understand why you cannot save them on the hard drive those are my only cons  .
i recommend this camera .
my best recommendation that you must absolutely follow is to put the camcorder on a tripod , do not move the camcorder , do not , i repeat do not pan or move the camera up , down , to the left or to the right  .
if you move the camera at all youll have a horrible recording with terrible interlacing blur  .
keep the camera absolutely stationary  .
and then dont have your subject that you are recording move very fast  .
if your object moves fast , you will have terrible interlacing blur problems on playback  .
the funny thing is , the interlacing problems do not show up on that little lcd monitor screen  .
moving objects and moving the camera looks fine on the lcd screen when you are recording  .
do not believe it  .
on playback if you are moving the camera at all , panning left or right , up or down , or zooming the lens  .
it plays back terribly interlaced  .
dont let your object or people move fast as you are recording them  .
it looks fine in the lcd screen but the playback will really suck on the 1920 x 1080i playback  .
moving the camera or fast moving subjects wont look that good at the lower 960 x 540i playback either  .
if the camera is on a tripod and the objects move slowly in really good bright light , you will love the recording quality  .
i repeat  .
a stationary camera on a tripod and a non    moving or slow moving subject/object will give you amazing hd quality on playback  .
i suggest using the 60i and not the 24p and dont use the cinema mode  .
i think the 60i is the better recording option  .
the 24p is a tad more jittery  .
i cant do anything but speculate about that cinema mode , i dont totally understand it , but i think it has something to do with 24p or 24 full frames per second  .
dont just go out and shoot without putting that camera on a stationary tripod  .
you will most likely be disappointed with the playback if you hand hold the camcorder , especially , especially when you use the zoom  .
the jitter on playback when you hand hold and zoom is unusable  .
panning is better with a non hd mini dv camcorder  .
my old canon elura 40 mc mini dv camcorder is more clear with less blur when i panned with that lower resolution camcorder then when i pan with this canon hg10  .
the best tip , dont move the hg10 camcorder at all when you are recording  .
trust me , 20 hours of recorded vacation time later , i found out what doesnt work , and what vacation shots are a blur and which ones are amazing and i feel like im there again  .
avoid interlacing problems , jittery playback , and blur in your playback and video editing .
you can be making movies in min with the hg10  .
the onboard mic is poor , so i recommend attaching a rode video mic and you will not only have awesome sound , but totally wicked looking camcorder (yes , it does fit on the accessory shoe)  .
also , the 1st generation avchd codec is pretty good so do not feel shy about 15mb/sec bit rate its perfectly fine for your average point and shooter  .
(you probably wont bet getting 30mb/sec at that price range for at least another 2    3 years)  .
the fact that you can record continuously for over 5 hrs is selling point for my circumstance  .
i use it for recording instrumental concerts and solo recital performances (which can easily go over 60 min , so there is no need for changing tapes)  .
many of these concerts are in low light conditions and my experiences have shown the camera performs reasonably well for its price bracket if you want a low cost , hd camera solution , the hg10 is the way to go .
i have read critism about the inability to shoot photos and save them to hard drive  .
being new to the world of camcorders i like the idea of keeping the two modes seperate  .
it prevents confusion  .
either you are in camera mode or movie mode  .
i guess the drawback here is you are forced to purchse a $25 mini sd card .
this camcorder has it all  .
it has a great sensor in 1920 x 1080 @ 60i or offers 24p which works great paired with excellent canon optics  .
with the build in lens cover is one of the fantastic features compared to older camcorders the zoom rocker is professional level , placed perfectly and has excellent control and smooth variable zoom speeds the construction is like solid hunk of metal  .
it feels sturdy in the hand and the construction is very high quality the biggest part of this camera is that is has a harddrive for recording between 6 and 15 hours of video depending on resolution  .
transfer to pc is lighting fast @ 20mb/second  .
so you can copy over 2 hours of video in about 15 minutes avchd is the future standard for all camcorders video  .
while some early adopters of avchd are complaining about lack of editing software and support , i really do not see that as a big deal  .
the best software is pinnacle studio 11  .
1 or sony vegas 8a and they both work great today  .
but it's only going to get better as the months move on  .
and at ces2008 100% of the camcorders are avchd format , so it's very clear that this format is full    speed    ahead  .
this camera has a 24p mode which is great for film like effects  .
i must say that it works flawlessly  .
yes , contrary to some reviews it is flawless  .
those people giving it low marks for 24p and some saying that it's so bad it's unusable all made big mistakes in their review  .
they did not use a compatible player  .
the player they used tried to convert the 24p to 60i and back to 29  .
97p and that is why you get bad playback  .
but if you get a compatible player it's perfect  .
confusion over 1440 x 1080 or is it 1920 x 1080  .
there's a lot of debate and no real answer here no one can say for sure at this point what the real resolution of this camcorder is  .
it's advertised at 1920 , it shows up in some appications at 1920  .
however other applications show it as 1440 but some are starting to lean toward the applications being the issue and downsizing the 1920 to 1440 incorrectly the only con's i have are all minor , but i do have 5 1  .
) the power/mode button is a little awkward to reach and use  .
most of the time i need to use my left hand 2  .
) missing standard accessories   there is no battery charger , only a power cord  .
and there is no neck strap 3  .
) the low light performance is viewable , but very noisy and grainy 4  .
) when copying files to the pc you must have the power cord connected which can be annoying since it's a 2 piece cord with power pack 5  .
) i have not found a way to go strait to play mode  .
you need to go to record mode , wait for it to start , then go to play mode  .
about 4 seconds of time , but it also opens the lens cover unnecessarily overall , i have no idea why you would buy any other camcorder on the market especially anything with tape  .
well i just got a hg 10 for christmas and i love it  .
but when i went to download it to the computer it said the film is corruptest but it is working on the camera  .
i tried it on a few other computers and same thing  .
someone please help me  .
this is the one to get  .
outstanding image quality with brilliant color  .
the cmos does make a big different in today's digital photography and hdd video  .
canon really made some changes and has re    claimed the market from sony and panasonic  .
this has been the best seller so far i could not believe my eyes when i saw the footage taken with this camcorder  .
i highly recommend it to those owning lcd or plasma hd tvs  .
you'll be happy to replace minidv with this cmos hd beauty .
the canon hg    10 is a superb follow    on to the top rated and highly acclaimed canon hv    20 we could not be happier  .
we thank lori grunin for her insightful review  .
we purchased the camcorder from one of cnet's partners this is a gem of a camcorder  .
obviously each reviewer has their own specific reasons for purchasing such an advanced camcorder this is our third camcorder and we have been shooting family events , vacations and even hurricanes for close to 20 years  .
we burn our captured footage on a number of dvds and share with family members (many who live a great distance away) we have two hdtvs and are about to buy a blu    ray player  .
our sony camcorder died in the uk this summer and instead of buying another sd camcorder , we decided it is time to step up why now  .
although simple hd capture and burning software and inexpensive high def dvd burners are behind the curve at the present time , they are going to happen  .
sony , panasonic , canon and all the rest & will make it happen  .
this is too big a potential market to ignore so we decided to shoot in high def now , save the backed up video on our hard drive and/or off    line storage , and burn in standard definition now when the software makers and dvd burner makers decide to catch up and make it easy to burn family movies , we will have our (saved) high def files ready to convert to blu ray or hddvd or both there are a ton of very technical reviews on the hg    10 on this and other websites  .
cnet and amazon provide a great deal of information , camcorderinfo  .
com and smartguider  .
com are just two of the many others  .
we think any buyer should review them all and also do a web search on  .
canon hg    10 reviews  .
after days of reading reviews virtually every web review and visiting at least 7 retail stores we came away with some interesting observations  .
you are not going to get much technical help at the major retail outlets  .
you can get hands on and see what works for you when comparing the hg    10 to the canonhv    20 , there is no comparison as to the ergonomic superiority of the hg    10 for the technical data you will have to hit the web as the folks in the stores just do not have the depth you need to help you make this kind of buying decision we found a few very helpful gems in selecting this camcorder 1) we went to the canon website &  .
www  .
usa  .
canon  .
com and downloaded the hg    10 manual in  .
pdf format (yes it is 118 pages) but if you print the pages in short batches , you will have an excellent and very readable document to review before and after you purchase the hg    10  .
the manual that comes in the box is very small and hard to read  .
it would also be a very wise idea to also download the  .
pdf file for the corel application disc version two 2) this corel guide is a much shorter manual just 16 pages long  .
you really want to read this one cover to cover before you buy , and particularly page 3 , where they discuss needed pc systems requirements you may want to talk (or email) with canon and/or corel regarding your pc versus their recommended size of the pc system  .
we have a core 2 duo dell so the corel software posed no problems 3) we called cannon tech support while reviewing the manual  .
you will be delighted to find out their 800 number ( 1    800    828    4040) is located virginia , they are very well trained and if you have a problem they can immediately lay their hands on an hg    10 and go thru a process step    by    step with you  .
they were even available on a saturday afternoon 4) we cannot say enough good things about canon support  .
having spent untold hours since the early days of the ibm pc , on support lines , trying to get help with hardware and software , we think canon really got it right  .
a couple short calls to canon to clarify some questions made it easy for us to choose the hg    10 on the hg    10       all the controls were when we really liked them  .
the hg    10 borrows a lot of its technology from its tape driven hv    20 sister but after living with internal tape transports in many worldwide (hot , cold and dusty) climates and situations over the years , the hard drive is a very logical choice  .
the 5 and � hours of hxp (full 1080)    highest format is plenty for any vacation realistically , how many folks want to sit through even a three hour home movie  .
we have learned from hollywood keep it short keep it snappy keep it interesting  .
five and � hours of high def video gives you a ton of material to work with from any vacation  .
when you get home , the corel software that comes with the canon allows you to immediately back up your video files and you are ready to initialize (format) the hard drive and you are ready to go with a fresh 5 � hours of hxp going through the hg    10 manual provides many happy surprises  the camcorder has more features than you can believe and most reviewers do not have the time or space to address all of the abilities of this camcorder  .
this camcorder takes better still photos than our sony cybershot h    5 (which suffers from chromatic aberration in certain situations) we purchased a 1 gb (canon recommends no bigger than 2gb) sandisk mini    sd card that also comes with an sd adapter  .
if you already have still photo capture and edit software , you may not need to load the entire very voluminous still photo (digital video solution version 27  .
0) software that comes on a cd with the hg    10  .
we went through the manual for that disc and it is all about still photos having more still photo software than we can ever use already on our pc , we skipped that installation why not get a usb    based media card reader for your pc (if it does not have one) for under $25  .
when you take still photos just remove the card from the hg    10 and insert it into a usb media card reader  .
while , we did not by this camcorder for still photos we are more than delighted with the stills that we can capture in camera mode regarding connections (page 83 in the hg    10 manual) we love displaying the hxp high def  .
video footage on our hdtv  .
we connect the hg    10 to the hdtv via the (optional) mini    hdmi to hdmi cable  .
the canon manual calls this an optional htc    100 hdmi cable sony sells a vmc    15mhd hdmi mini to hdmi that works very well  .
canon does not provide this and you will not find these cables in most stores at the present so you may have to order one over the web as many highly regarded reviewers have noted , use the hdmi connection whenever you can for the best quality our hdtv had only one hdmi input (already being used) so we purchased a belkin hdmi 3 to 1 switch box that allows us to now plug in hd cable , the hg    10 and a future blue ray player  .
we keep the hg    10 hdmi cable always plugged into the home system and by attaching the mini hdmi to the camcorder we can see 1080 hd home movies in an instant a couple of user plusses on the hg    10 are the lcd display and the image stabilization  .
both are excellent  .
the size of the hg    10 is amazingly small and it is incredibly light  .
we cannot believe they pack that much technology into such a small package  .
the electronic reminder messages on the screen are quite helpful as we all make mistakes we like the quick start and the instant auto focus features  .
we would suggest buying the optional carrying strap and also a second battery when you order an hg    10 we plan to add more information to this review regarding burning video and creating avchd discs but at this time we think this is the perfect camcorder for our needs .
with our first baby on the way buying a new camcorder is a must  .
i really contemplated buying a regular hard drive or the hd version  .
glad i made the decision i did  .
so far this camcorder is fantastic  .
love the overall design , easy of use and video quality  .
i chose this one over the sony because of the video quality on the screen and the fact that the canon has a manual viewer for those bright sunny days where it is difficult to see the screen outdoors  .
i do recommend that you purchase the energizer er    d127 10 hour battery as the one that comes with the camera only lasts 1 hour .
great image quality  .
you'll find no better  .
but the menu is hard to use , and there are options within options  .
you'll need to read and re    read the user manual before you can fully use this camera  .
then you'll need to keep the manual with you so you can follow up but , other than that it is great  .
i would buy this before any other out there and i played with the new sony and new jvc while making my decision .
i have been researching a new hd camcorder for months  .
is originally going to purchase the sony hdr    sr1 , then is interested in the hdr    sr7 when it came out  .
i ended up getting the canon because of the great image quality they're known to have as well as the fact that i did not have to pay an extra $300 over the japanese model to get english menus as i would have had to do with the sony  .
i got it just in time to record my first child's birth  .
when we finally got home and looked at the footage on our samsung lcd hdtv , i is amazed at the picture quality  .
i've downloaded so many examples from all hd camcorder options , and is very impressed with the canon  .
i have very large hands and find that the camcorder is comfortable  .
i love the fact that it has a hdd  .
i know that there is a huge debate between tape and hdd , but i find it so easy to transfer avchd footage from the camcorder to the computer  .
i am using pinnacle 11 for editing and find it easy to do  .
it does take some time to render with the compression of avchd , but it is good none the less the battery seems loose on the camcorder  .
this is not the first time i've heard this for a canon  .
also , the location of the usb port is such that the lcd screen must be open to plug in  .
this is annoying the menu system is good  .
options are easy to access  .
i do wish it had a dial/ring to control focus etc however  .
40gb is enough as i tend to download the footage to a computer quickly anyway i can hear a sound from within the camcorder when i turn it off  .
i believe it is the head of the hdd disengaging itself  .
it does sound like it could be a problem in the future though  .
but many not too the mini hdmi port is nice , however , finding a cable for it is difficult all in all , i'm really glad i waited  .
what i wanted most is an awesome picture with a nice auto option for my wife to use  .
that is what it does with the option to use it in a prosumer sense as well  .
the 24p is great in good lighting situations , but lowlight causes a lot of artifacts well done though canon  .
you have a product that is superior in my eyes .
considering its price , effective features and capabilities , you cannot go wrong with the hg10  .
it is a great camcorder for hd (in fairness , i have yet to see full hd quality since i only have a dvd burner but dvd quality is great)  .
the images are a bit soft but , this might be able to be adjusted if i ever remember to do so  .
i prefer sharp edges so , if you prefer this , make sure you can adjust it (if you prefer softer images than you are good to go)  .
controls are in obvious simple    to    find places , making it easy to shoot  .
switching modes from camcorder to camera and viewing videos and pictures on the hg10 could be made a little easier but , it is not a deal breaker  .
also , any camcorder these days should come with a shoulder strap and this one makes you buy it as an accessory  .
the camcorder also picks up wind noise (especially when point up) a bit more than you'll remember their being wind while shooting but not too terribly    this is probably catch 22 since it also does a good job of picking up sounds all around you instead of just where you are pointing  .
battery life seems to be great (i've shot on average around one hour of the highest quality hd and still have more than half the battery left each time , though i'd recommend you buy and have a spare handy always)  .
the amount of video you can record seems to be in line with what is promised too  .
overall , this is a great camcorder that 95 percent of those on the market for an hd drive    based camcorder should like very much updated  .
on oct 14 , 2008  .
overall , i'm very pleased with my hg10  .
it is intuitive , easy to use , and makes great video    even in low light conditions  .
i have had my hg10 for about a year and it has operated flawlessly  .
i originally purchased it to record my youngest son's wedding reception  .
the pictures turned out very good even though the light level at the reception is not bright enough to read  .
however , although the camera has a still picture mode , i would not recommend it as a replacement for a good still photo digital camera  .
the pictures are ok , but nowhere near the quality of my canon eos 20d  .
also , the still mode does not use the 40 gbyte hard disk and you need to insert a mini sd card to use the still picture mode  .
a mini sd card is not supplied with the camcorder    which is strange since they are so cheap (around $10 for 1 gbyte) there have been some complaints about the audio on the hg10  .
however , i have not experienced any problems with audio  .
the built in microphones seem to do fine at picking up anything my ears picked up when the recordings were made  .
there is an option to use external microphones on the camcorder ; however , since i'm satisfied with the audio recording already , i have not tried external microphones other areas where i am pleased with the camcorder are battery life and software  .
i purchased a spare battery for the hg10 , but is pleasantly surprised that i have not needed it to date  .
i can record hours of video on one battery  .
also , the software supplied with the unit has been quite satisfactory  .
the conversion process to dvd format is slow , but the results are good and the hd aspect ratio is preserved  .
someday , i'll get a blu    ray recorder and see how the hd looks in that format .
i do not think you will be disappointed with this camcorder  .
it produces very good quality video , the menus are easy to use the hard drive stores about 5+ hours of high quality video  .
the sound quality is good , but unfortunately there is no control over the volume if you want to cut sound out you have to edit this out with software the transfer of data from the camcorder to the computer hard drive is good the video format used is avchd , if you are using software to edit the video onto dvd , it can take a few hours it takes stills but has to be captured on a memory card  .
the quality of the photographs is adequate about 3 megapixel , but no more than that i have found that the stop/start button is not readily at hand  .
is placed at the back of the camcorder  .
in my opinion it should have been placed near to the zoom control in my opinion this is camcorder is very good and no comparison with the average video camcorder on the market today the price of this product has already been reduced  .
if you are looking for a quality camcorder you will not be disappointed .
overall happy with quality of product  .
not thrilled about the choice of avchd format .
i just bought the cannon hg10 about a week ago , and i is immediately blown away by the great video quality , but the record button is in such an inconvenient place (i had to press it with the base of my thumb)  .
i decided to take it out at night , and videotape stuff , so i could get a feel for the night features  .
the video quality is hurt a lot by the low light , but it was not horrible  .
i uploaded the videos onto my pc to see some of the features that the included video editing software had , and my pc practically could not handle the video , it would jump , and the sound would lag sometimes more than a second in front of the video  .
i have a compaq that has a 256mb ati card , 2  .
2 ghz , and 2gb of ram  .
the box recommended at least a 3  .
0 ghz processor  .
overall , i love the camera , and it is such a leap of quality , judging on that the last camera i had is a sony dcr    hc21  .
but i just cant get over all of the small little quirks .
i would recommend this camera to anyone that does not want to use a sd camera anymore but if you really want hi    end hd , wait a year or two .
controls are a bit hard to use with my fairly large hands , and took several hours to find out the software supplied as well as most other video software doesn't even see the camera or edit the avchd files the hg10 creates  .
not impossible , but the solution is makes for very long conversions to usable files  .
if you have a g5 or old mac    i'd suggest a camera that does not create avchd files  .
otherwise its an excellent camera .
when i purchased the hg    10 , i did not realize that (from what i've found so far) the software makers use 'firewire' connections to transfer digital video from the camera to the pc  .
i upgraded my pc's video card , power supply , ram operating system to take advantage of the camera's abilities  .
that's when the trouble started  .
first vista doesn't work with the supplied corel oem software  .
corel does not support oem software either  .
i is not happy with corel  .
i purchased pinnacle studio ultimate 11  .
like i said , no firewire port    no dv transfer  .
why have an hd video recorder when you cannot transfer it in a digital format  .
exactly .
this is my first (and last) camcorder from canon i decided to buy it because of the good user reviews , but as it turns out , this hd camera is being sold through the apple store and the reviews were done by apple users who are not tech saavy people  .
for these apple people , it is probably their first hd camera and they thought wow this camera is the best camera ever  .
, which is of course far from the truth    especailly in comparisson to similarly priced cameras from sony the biggest problem  .
exteremely poor , actually useless , low light performance  .
any kind of indoor recording will yield a fuzzy picture that is so bad you would be better off using your 20 year old sd video camera instead  .
i tried every single setting , this camera simply will not record a good video in low light or indoors  .
i contacted canon about the problem and they would not admit that there is a problem  .
reading through on    line forums , there is a firmware upgrade , but for whatever reason canon is not making it available on    line  .
and if your camera , like mine , is not under warranty then you are out of luck because you cannot send it in to canon either (which they make you do on your own dime) the sound quality is not good either  .
and the user interface is not easy or intuitive i will never buy a canon product again  .
very poor customer service and extremely poor products  .
i bought this camcorder to do online videos and to my surprise it takes a long time to convert the files into usable files  .
most conversion times with other products seem like seconds compared to the hours with this camera  .
i took it back for a refund and got hit with a $105  .
45 restocking fee  .
it did not meet my needs .
great camera , great pictures , very fragile  .
must have the external mic (built    in is terrible)  .
hard disk crashed for no apparent reason    lost pictures , have to return , etc  .
, etc  .
recommend that you not buy hard disk camera  .
everything else is great .
i bought the camera a week before the birth of my son  .
i have had great experiences with canon products and spent hours reviewing the various comments on the hg 10  .
i had little doubt the camera would work perfectly out of the box  .
instead , my hard    drive cannot speak to my computer  .
this is a hardware problem that canon has informed me it may or may not fix depending on the decision of a technician  .
of course , this assumes i'm willing to send in my camera for servicing , which would leave me without a camera to film the first weeks of my son's life  .
so i am stuck transferring all images to my sd card in order to download them to my computer which is an exercise in utter futility  .
the canon editing software is absolute garbage  .
windows media player and moview maker are incapable of reading the canon  .
mts files  .
this means that i have been unable to view or show my video on anything other than the camera viewfinder window  .
i have hours of great movies of my son (well , i think they're great) and cannot show them to my friends and family  .
i have done an exhaustive search to find the right codec to fix this problem and have come up dry  .
the only working codec i found is sitting on a site with a soviet flag waving in the corner    trojans , anyone  .
canon is of absolutely no help    they have no codec for windows on their download page for the hg 10  .
i have purchased my last canon product  .
i is preparing to buy a rebel slr and switched to the nikon after my frustrations with the hg 10  .
i hope at some point in the future to be able to use the videos i have taken of my son , but i am not holding my breath .
