very happy with my 08 accord, performance is quite adequate it has nice looks and is a great long,  distance cruiser .

 6, 4, 3 eco engine has poor performance and gas mileage of 22 highway .

 overall performance is good but comfort level is poor .

 i'm impressed with the performance as well as efficiency gains .

 it has room, performance, good mpg for its size and excellent reliability .

 for the record i test, drove the lexus350 the bmw 5 series, the infiniti g35 and enjoyed the honda performance equally for far less money !

 very happy with the car enjoy the ride and performance .

 the performance of the engine is very smooth .

 this car had rattles at 500 miles and has horrible performance even for a four cylinder .

 great performance and handling make this a real winner !

 engine performance lacks punch after 60, head rest are poor design, lacks driver seat memory rear seat a c, radio system is marginal compared to bose, seats are hard and small for a large person .

 there seem to be so many components that enter into the vcm that performance can vary widely from car to car .

features, quality, reliability, and performance, at a price no other car maker can touch .

 190 hp engine is a good compromise for performance and fuel economy .

i owned this car for only a week, but i am pleasantly surprised by its performance and build quality .

this car lacks the performance and handling of previous years .

 good looking inside and out, comfortable and roomy, commendable performance, and excellent gas mileage .

 still enjoy interior and exterior styling as well as overall performance and handling .

 i just put it on the highway this weekend and its performance was amazing !

 the bigger size has taken some getting used to, but the additional horsepower compared to the '02 and the performance are like night and day .

 it fits right , is fun to drive, great stereo, fuel economy, performance .

 if you want sports sedan handling and performance, then pay much more and buy a true sports sedan !

 i went for comfort over performance to fit it in my budget so the ex, l with the 4 cyl engine .

 i researched many other makes and models but for the performance, quality, and style, the accord won hands down for cars under $32,000 .

 performance is outstanding, more like a sports car than a coupe .

 lots of power with the 6 spd, and the car has a great balance of style, performance, and   reliability .

 no problem with quality, performance, etc .

 engine performance is very lacking .

t anywhere close to 3 series on many facets, namely performance, but sadly to say, in others, it surpasses .

 the 4 cylinder lacks performance and handling and the gas saving is only minimal .

 the car is great, both with styling and performance .

 i purchased a 2004 v6,  leather and i did not think honda could do any better with design or performance .

 i love the styling the performance and handling .

i was looking for a luxury, feel car with great performance at a good price .

overweight ,  3600 pounds, lots of road noise, and the combined performance of the vcm and the grade logic automatic transmission mke this a miserable driver .

 the interior design and the performance of the v6 are the highlights .

i was looking for a mid size coupe with style, performance and all season traction capability .

styling in and out is fantastic, and the v, 6 performance is all one would hope for and more .

 it does not diminish the performance of the car, it is just annoying .

after tracking almost 2 months of research on american and japanese mid, size car models, only two stands out for their performance, reliability and safety ,  honda accord and toyota camry .

 my my, i have never experienced such smooth performance, stability, pick, up, mileage and comfort that i am enjoying with my new 2008 honda accord .

 i admire engine performance and comfort while driving atleast 30 mile a day to job .

i have owned 4 honda's and have come to rely on the fantastic quality of performance and lack of maintenance issues .

 the car is superb, performance, styling, quality, engineering, fit and finish , the whole banana  !

 the performance is incredible !

 gas mileage is great for a vehicle with this type of performance .

 i could not be happier with the performance and ride of this car .

 when i first tested the ex, l v6, the performance and handling of the car sold me,  i had to get it and i did .

 honda has outdone itself on styling and performance .

 its ride, comfort and overall performance is an absolute joy .

 the previous models were boring both aestically and performance wise .
