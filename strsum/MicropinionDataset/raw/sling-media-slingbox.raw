Pros:. Can watch taped programs from anywhere in the country.. 
Cons:. Depending on where you are located, if wireless signal not strong, then your slingbox streaming is poor.. 
Summary:. I love the slingbox. It is byfar the best invention of this decade. Watching TV from anywhere in the country that I have internet signal is wonderful. Not only that, but now you can watch it on smartphones. I love the slingbox.. 

$$;
Pros:. Watch TV ANYWHERE!, No monthly fees!. 
Cons:. Monopolizes Audio/Video source.. 
Summary:. The Slingbox is probably one of the greatest and most satisfying gadgets I have purchased in the past year. I've had the Slingbox for about a year now and have utilized it in a variety of creative ways. For the uninitiated, the Slingbox streams any audio or video source over the internet. Allowing you to watch/listen through any internet connected PC or mobile phone. For example, Slingbox allows me to watch live television on my Cingular 8125(works decently on EDGE, probably flawless with 3G-HSDPA). Ahhh! Finally, I don't have to miss the latest sports highlights while at school! The Slingbox can also be utilized in creative ways. I once connected my video camera to the Slingbox and was able to watch the video output on my phone. Perhaps the most satisfying aspect about Slingbox is no monthly fees! Makes me wish more companies would take the same approach as Sling Media. The only small drawback to Slingbox is that it will monopolize the device it is connected to. Nevertheless, the Slingbox is an awesome product and a must have for any technology enthusiast.. 

$$;
Pros:. Product works perfectly, easy to setup. 
Cons:. Cannot think of a single "Con". 
Summary:. The slingbox is one of the coolest things I have seen in years. I use it to monitor security cameras in my house, and watch TV anywhere in my house. The Pocket PC client, which is NOT free, works very well, including in public hotspots, at work, etc. The remote control for VCRs/DVDRs works nicely. The price on the Slingbox has come done since its release, so I am thinking of getting another!. 

$$;
Pros:. TV anytime, anywhere.. 
Cons:. None...I love this Sling-thing!. 
Summary:. As an active duty military family, we're part of a transient community that is frequently away from home. As an example, my wife is leaving in 2 weeks for a 12-month assignment to South Korea, where she will be limited to very few TV channels that offer way too much military propaganda. Now that we've configured her Dell laptop with Slingplayer and have set aside a separate digital cable box exclusively for her use here in our Stateside home, she will be able to watch all 280 channels from our current cable subscription. May not seem like a big deal for most people, but years of family separation and being overseas has taught us how important these little things can become. Our tests of the remote functionality have all been great. Dell recently offered the Slingbox at a special price of $179 with free shipping, so it was a great investment for us.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Documentation for Set up, PROMPT &#38; Helpful Support staff!!. 
Cons:. You need DSL, ISDN, Broadband or Cable on the road.. 
Summary:. Watched all the 2005-06 Bowl games in Athens, Greece with NO problem. Thanks SlingBox !!. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect Picture Quality, takes very little room , does its job right and very easy to setup. 
Cons:. Wireless Connectivity would be great, How about real a remote control. 
Summary:. Bought it for $199.99 at best buy, set up took 5 minutes and played it and loved it. This is exactly what I was looking for. I view it mostly on my wireless laptop and my wireless laptop uses wireless b connection but the picture is perfect. Now I dont have to have my treadmill in front of my tv, I can take my tv top other room if my little girl falls asleep next to me. I can take it ot the kitchen and no miss any scene. This is just great. I love it. An external remote would be great help but other than that I cant think of anything right now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video quality, no subscription required, easy to set up.. 
Cons:. Ugly physical design, somewhat limited control at times. Otherwise, perfect for what it is used for.. 
Summary:. The slingbox is great for a student who spends alot of time on their laptop around campus. My campus has all-around wireless access, which means that I can watch TV while I am on a break from class, studying, or just relaxing in a lounge. Sure you can watch episodes of TV shows that you may have downloaded, but there is nothing better then having 100+ channels at your disposal anywhere that you can access the net in the world. Keeping up with local news has never been easier, and having something to do when I'm not in class (or drinking) is great!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, Great Video and Audo Quality. 
Cons:. none at this time. 
Summary:. This is an incredible device, very easy to setup...less than 5 minutes. Quality equipment that worked the first time out. I have it setup to Direct TV, and no issues...love watching recorded programing with Tivo as well.... I have it hooked up to my Xbox wireless gaming adapter, and it works perfect, on the LAN I get about 1MB streaming video, on the WAN I get about 300Kbps.. Once they have a PDA application, I am buying that as well...imagine the possiblity of having your bluetooth enabled PDA attached to your LAN watching TV while you are outside at the pool!. I wish this was a publicly held company, I would buy stock today!. Absolutely the best invention I have seen this year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set up, Great interface, and super simple to use. 
Cons:. None that I can think of. 
Summary:. This little device is the best thing since my Tivo. I got it out of the box and plugged in all the cables. I threw the set up disk in my wireless laptop within 3 mins I was up and running.. The remote looks just like my tivo's 'peanut' remote, and works flawlessly. It is really like bringing my tivo on the road. I have a friend with out cable, so I call him when I am about to watch a show he likes and he can watch with me. I also hooked up my camcorder's RCA output jacks to the slingbox's inputs and "POOF" instant netcam (Or security cam)with sound and video - I suppose I could even show a home movie to my friends and relatives. Next time I watch a movie I can share it with a loved one!. I really love this little thing. My co-worker's jaws hit the floor when I showed them. Now I just need better high speed internet access. (I have DSL with only a 300K upload - so the quality is good enough to look good with about 1/4 or 1/3 of the screen - any bigger and it looks poor).. 

$$;
Pros:. TV anywhere, reasonable price, easy setup. 
Cons:. quality poor during low bandwidh.. 
Summary:. I am a college student and found out there is no cable in the dorms. I purchased a slingbox with the intention of streaming cable from my house (oregon) to my dorm room (cali). I then ran an S-Video and audio cables out to my TV and sound system. When I watch the slingplayer i use it on my TV as a second monitor and full screen it, which lessens the quality, but if you have bandwidth to spare then its fine. The quality is poor at higher more active times of day down here cause everyone is on there computer (which sucks), but at night and in the morning the picture is real nice. I reccommend this product to anyone on the fence about getting it, it won't dissapoint you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up with newer routers; Watch recorded shows or live TV away from home; Great for travelers. 
Cons:. Requires a boradband connection at BOTH ends, at home and away.. 
Summary:. This is a terrific invention. No hard drives, no subscription fees. Simply connect SlingBox between your TiVo or ReplayTV and your broadband router (also works with cable or satellite box).. Install the SlingBox software on your laptop, connect to the internet from anywhere in the world (broadband connection REQUIRED) and you can watch your favorite live or recorded programs.. I give the SlingBox a "10." HOWEVER, if your internet connection is slow, SlingBox will be a terrible disappointment.. I've used it on the road even in China to watch my favorite shows recorded on ReplayTV back in Texas. I used it to watch live coverage of Hurricane Katrina and watch live Texas Longhorn football.. I highly recommend the SlingBox.. but just know that you HAVE TO HAVE a FAST connection to make it work as advertised.. 

$$;
Pros:. A very simple and easy install. This device comes with all the cables you will need. I should be up and going within 30 to 40 minutes. The connection from remote locations is very quick.. 
Cons:. Although the picture quality is excellent, it is a little dark.. 
Summary:. This is an excellent buy! The Install was quick and simple as well as connecting to the box. The device found my IR settings and the settings on my router with absolutely NO PROBLEMS at all. The people at Sling Media should be commended for bring this to the market. YAY!. 

$$;
Pros:. This thing is simple to install, works as advertised and has surprisingly good quality.. 
Cons:. It has to be hard wired to your router...oh well. 
Summary:. I got this thing home and plugged it in and it worked marvelously. There are very few times in life you find a new breed of toy or device you cannot live without. I remember the first time I got a cell phone, the internet, tivo/DVR and lost my "V-card". This is right up there with all of them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Control your TV anywhere you go!. 
Cons:. No HD imput &#38; Streams in TCP not UDP?. 
Summary:. Ok first post here so let me get right to the point. I have been waiting for over a year to get my mitts on one of these units and man was it worth it! Let me get to the point.... I way away from my CT home on 9/11 in San Francisco and was stuck in a guest office with nothing but internet and no TV for 3 days! Since then I have always wanted a product like this to be available so I can get news &#38; TV shows live or on demand when I need it. Before the slingbox I was using a Beyond TV duel tuner system witch was a costly solution and required 3 different ports to be open on my router and if my Cable modems ip ever changed I was screwed until I could get home. Oh and you will need a computer to run it.. Now with the Slingbox I first started using its built in TV tuner card and set it to use port 8888 and now I can hit it from anywhere (NY / CT offices or on my laptop). Heck with a Verizion EDVO card I was able to watch TV live on my Metro North train ridge home. The trick to this unit is it will figure out an optimized ping time between you machine and the box and will automatic determine the correct speed to stream to you.. Next thing I did was go to cablevision and upgrade to a new Senitific Atlantic 8300HD cable box / dvr. I ran the HD out to my plasma and the 2nd output to the slingbox. Once plugged in I told the slingbox client what cable box I had and it pulled down an update from there server and next thing you know I am all set! I loved it so much that I got a 2nd unit just to control my HP Z555 Media center pc.. Giving credit where credit is due&. When you set up the sling box you can either have it test the connection to their public server and create a finder id and password or you can direct your computer to the unit. If you have this unit behind a firewall you will have to redirect it port to whatever you choose via tcp. And if you are not famillier with how to do that they will even ask you what type of router you have and attempt to go into the router admin tool and configure it for you! WOW! Slingbox is totally making it a point to work for anyone and at no charge for it finder id server (aka DDNS) and that says a lot for them.. Cons: Nothing bad but a few things to remember. First no duel tuner just a single built into the unit. No HD Component/ DVI or HDMI inputs. And yes when I play the Yankees on an HD channel on a full screen TV at a hotel room it looks better even with the RCA inputs. 1 other thing if you are going to watch music videos you will notice the song will pay a little slower but once optimized it will start to speed up.. Great bang for the buck and its a must if you travel for a living to different hotels and want to feel like youre at home.. Dz. 

$$;
Pros:. Watch live or recorded TV from anywhere in the world, easy to setup. 
Cons:. Price is $250 (although worth every penny). 
Summary:. Both the hardware (SlingBox) and the software (SlingPlayer) work great. None have crashed in almost a week of use. Here's how I have used it:. 1) Laptop in backyard, watched Brazilian soccer and the Giants beat the Dodgers while writing a few articles for my blog.. 2) Watched the Giants beat the Dodgers again in my "office at home" while writing some code. My VGA has an S-VIDEO out option. Went to Circuit City and bought a TV and I can now watch anything full screen while having the Slingplayer minimized. This rocks!. 3) While cooking some good spaghetti, placed the laptop on the kitchen counter and watched "Six Feet Under". I think I'll cook a bit more now that I've got any show, including live Baseball/Football.. 4) Went to my buddy's place, and installed the Slingplayer on his XP. He was amazed at how well it works. He travels a lot to Korea, so he'll be getting one on Monday!. 5) Went to my Mom's and showed her how cool this is. She likes the French channel, so she'll be watching it a few programs I recorded on one of the three ReplayTVs we have. The streaming from one ReplayTV to another works great, and the streaming from the "Slinged" ReplayTV to my Mom's DSL worked without a glitch. I think I'm going to have to buy a second Slingbox since my Mom will probably be using it a lot.. Going to the Microsoft PDC in September and there are some critical World Cup qualifiers then - thank God for Slingbox!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Reliability. Good Picture Quality. Easy Set Up.. 
Cons:. Picture quality could be better but the picture is completely watchable.. 
Summary:. I have owned my slingbox since they were first released to the public. I have never had any problems with it and I have been using it nearly daily. It was easy to set up and the quality is totally watchable. The frequently update the firmware and I am impressed with each new revision. I love my Slingbox after years of owning it. I do not know about the newer boxes but my "classic" is fine for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. TV anywhere!!!. 
Cons:. not being able to save.... 
Summary:. I love this thing!!!! Having complete access to my DVR from my smartphone or my laptop is awesome!!! Also the picture quality is great!!! Works great on the Verizon Wireless EVDO network.. 

$$;
Pros:. It delivers what it promises. 
Cons:. No wireless support. 
Summary:. had a bit of a problem with the first unit I got, went back to the store exchanged it and it was working within 10 minutes.. If it supported wireless connectivity, it would definitely be a Perfect 10. You can even watch the HD channels, well at least you get the 16:9 screen of the HD channels.. Overall a great product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Now I could watch my favorite tv shows while surfing the net with my wireless laptop anywhere in my house.. 
Cons:. Only one device could watch at a time. Could not use my PSP to watch.. 
Summary:. Initially I bought the Sony LocationFree to maximize the feature of my PSP. But I disliked the fact that it will cost $30 userkey to install the player to each additional PC/laptop. Installation of LocationFree was easier than SlingBox but LocationFree does not have the right driver to control my DirectTV remote control.. I decided to return the LocationFree and bought the Slingbox instead. Each room in my house have wired-internet connections with a computer but no TVs in 2 of the bedrooms. Having this device for $200 have allowed me to streamline TV shows to the computers without needing to buy new TVs.. Remote viewing was also excellent after spending an hour of frustration while configuring the right port to be used in the router. I am so happy and I can't wait to get my new WindowsCE Phone/PDA to connect to my Slingbox and watch tv shows while away from home. It was a great product and a great experience overall.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything you'd need. 
Cons:. only one viewer at a time. 
Summary:. this device made my life much easier. frst i had tivo now this.. I'll be able to watch my TV and shows from everywhere i want. Thanks Sling media for this clever device. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Configuration and Great Picture. 
Cons:. No Recording Ability. 
Summary:. Everything as advertised. Beats the Sony hands down. Sony was difficult to configure and didn't have as good of a picture. Slingbox was easy to configure and has great performance on my 802.11g network.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Compatibility.. 
Cons:. Great Compatibility.. 
Summary:. Overall this is a great device. I would recommend it to everyone. Especially those who travel a lot or are in places in which they could use some entertainment. Personally, I use it at college in my down time and when I am at home. My current televisions are no longer being used.. 

$$;
Pros:. Watch Tv Anywhere and I do mean Anywhere.. 
Cons:. Can be tricky in setting up. Tech Support Very Helpful.. 
Summary:. I got my Sling Box brand new still in the box from Ebay for $150 and my Sling Link from Dell for $86 with Tax and S&#38;H. Saved Money this way.. I have had this set up for about a month now and I absolutely love it. I had some difficulty setting the system up. I use two routers. One for Vonage and the other a wireless router. I had to call Sling Box Tech Support. They were extremely helpful and freindly. Minimal wait time, Technician was easily understandable.. I use my Slingbox with Tivo. It can be a little slow in changing channels. You have to be patient. If you push in a command too many times it will register each one and you will have to wait for them all to clear. Can be a little annoying.. Picture quaility is descent. Great taking your tv with you. Love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. You can watch tv from any tv and many smart phones. 
Cons:. No built in WIFI. 
Summary:. This realy is one of the best gadgets I've ever used. At $249, it's s steal.. I have it piping tv to my home pc, laptop and Motorola Q phone....all 3 work well. I have the Slingbox connected to my wireless router via an ethernet cable.. The picture quality is great and I do not even have it running through a TV (Slingbox is hooked directly to the cable jack) Setup was a breeze. I switched routers after setting up, but all I had to do was reset the Slingbox and run through the setup wizard again.. Slingbox quality running through Motorola Q ia also very good, but if your going to use it on a phone, Cingular EDGE speeds result in choppy video. You need a phone with WIFI capabilities or EVDO (not sure how TMobile EDGE would do....heard it's faster than Cingular Edge). Unlike every other gadget I have owned, this one has realy had no downside so far (had it for about 2 months). 

$$;
Pros:. Lower Cost. 
Cons:. 800x600 size. 
Summary:. it allows me to watch TV at work, anywhere for that matter with a Net Connection, only downside is the native TV viewable size. But I think it is still the coolest new piece of technology out there!. 

$$;
Pros:. Remotes mirror actual remote; no monthly fees; easy set-up.. 
Cons:. No built-in wireless adapter.. 
Summary:. I'm in the US Air Force stationed in Turkey and purchased my Slingbox while home on leave last Christmas. I also purchased a Linksys gaming adapter so I could attach it to my high speed home network. I'm able to stream my Directv programming all they way from Texas including PPV through my laptop into the S-video connection on my TV. The picture is usually very good and if not it's because the network speeds here vary considerably. Everywhere else I've connected to it while on the road at aiports like DFW, BWI, O'Hare, Frankfurt and Istanbul International I've got very good reception.. I personally was dreading missing 15 months of watching my favorite sports teams while stationed here, but this fantastic little toy looking device has allowed me to keep up not only with them, but I've been able to keep up with all the shows I enjoyed watching while in the states and not have to settle for the limitted programming offered to all service members stationed overseas through the AFN Armed Forces Netwok).. I was even able to download SlingMedia's free software for my wife's Sprint Pocket PC running Windows Mobile 5.0 and it works great on it also.. Bottom-line...if you find yourself missing must-see shows or live games (Is there any other way to watch them?...), then this is the thing for you. You will not and cannot be disappointed!. 

$$;
Pros:. website has excellent help for setting it up. 
Cons:. gets knocked offline once in a while due to interruptions in internet data. 
Summary:. I rate this a 9, it is a really cool new gadget that works great. I bought the Slingbox just for World Cup so I wouldn't miss the games when I'm at work. But now I find myself tuning in often when on the road even before the cup matches start.. I see people on here complaining about the video quality. It is important to realize that the upstream bandwidth where you will be installing the Slingbox is the limiting factor for video quality. If you only have 128kbps you are not going to get great video. My home upstream tests at just over 400kbps which gives me pretty good video. I only have standard cable, so a signal splitter feed to the Slingbox lets me watch anything on my cable system without affecting the viewing of anyone at home. The Slingbox also has a composite video and S video inputs. I plugged in a video feed from my security cam and now I can also check my front door video from work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set-up. 
Cons:. Guide not available via co-axel on cable;. 
Summary:. I just set up my slingbox and I couldn't be happier(well if I could figure out how to make the TV guide from my cable box show I'd be happier). That said, I just have it hooked up via the co-axel connection. I tried the composite one and had the same problem. I don't have an available s-video connection.. Now I can watch my local baseball team in Hawaii.. I can even get my On-Demand movies on the road!. A+ for this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Video Quality. 
Cons:. Requires some tinkering, no built in wireless. 
Summary:. I bought this product because I'm an avid Red Sox fan and also a business traveler. I spent over 200 nights in hotels last year. So, the slingbox gives me the ability to take the Red Sox games with me wherever I go. I also enjoy watching local tv from time to time as well as the premium channels I have at home.. Set up was relatively easy. The slingplayer software has a very easy step by step setup guide. I had some issues becuase I tried using an xbox wireless bridge that I already owned instead of a standard wireless bridge. It was a little quirky and I decided to go with a netgear wireless bridge. Now that I have switched bridges, I have experienced minimal problems.. Using the slingbox is great. The frame rate and the audio always stay pretty good. The way that it compensates for lower speeds is to reduce the bit rate. So, your image continues to move smoothly, it just looks blurry (like a DivX recording). The remote control works very well with my comcast digital cable box. The graphical remote in the sling player looks almost identical to the remote I have at home.. I stream at about 300kb/s over my comcast HSI connection. The picture quality is pretty good at this rate. If I'm connected within my LAN (wireless-g speeds), it looks almost as good as normal TV. I think DSL users only uploading at 150 kb might be a little disappointed with video quality.. The only problems I have had revolve around my cable modem's IP address lease. It keeps expriring and not renewing. There is a patch for my router that I'm going to apply when I get home that should fix it.. If you are someone who travels quite a bit or is near a computer but not a TV, I would reccomend this product. I would also reccomend it to anyone who has access to TV but wants to see something on their home cable lineup when they are in another location.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works as advertised. I have been using it for several days with no problems.. 
Cons:. Instalation is a little complicated.. 
Summary:. The only down side to the product is the initial instalation process. Make sure the PnP option on your your router is enabled. This is required if you want the remote viewing of the Slingbox to work.. Other than the initial instalation this is a great product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Setup, cost, performance. 
Cons:. low resolution. 
Summary:. Amazingly easy setup. Forget to set your tivo before going to work? No problem, just login from any pc with the sling software and you can do it. Want to watch tv outside, in the bedroom, while on the 'throne'? Just use a wireless laptop (I use a tablet) and go anywhere.. One gripe. The picture isn't so great because of the low resolution. If the resolution were higher I could lower it if performance suffered. Hopefully, this will be addressed soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. My Direct TV Tivo anywhere I want it. 
Cons:. Setup a bit dicey with 2 routers. 
Summary:. After figuring out the SB would only broadcast if my DTV Tivo was in 480I mode and switching my Vonage router and Netgear router, the SB performs as advertised. I was able to remotely watch TV on my desk at work and of course on my pc at home. This is an awesome device as I can now see the Nationals at work since Comcast refuses to carry the games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Watch your TV shows anywhere you have access to high speed internet. 
Cons:. limited connections. 
Summary:. This is a great product. I love being able to watch my shows - even recorded shows - outside, at a friends and anywhere I have access to high speed internet. My only complaint is the lack of cable connectivity. Even so, connecting via RCA jacks produces a surprisingly nice picture on my laptop. I highly recommend this product as 'it just works'!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to set up, good tech support, works well,works with windows mobile.. 
Cons:. slow when working from remote location.. 

$$;
Pros:. Live TV anywhere in the world.. 
Cons:. Slow broadband connection = lower picture quality. 
Summary:. This is awesome. For $200 its completely worth it, I've been able to watch TV anywhere with broadband. If you have Verizon Wireless broadban access, then this is a must buy. I can watch TV at my construction site, at friends house and even in the car.. 1 think I love most is the easy installion, its simple, plug it in and let the CD do the rest.. I don't know how else to tell you how great this is. So I'm just going to descridbe it with the first word that come to mind.......speachless. Enjoy. 

$$;
Pros:. If you are not a very techical person this product is worth every penny.. 
Cons:. If you are more techical you will probably feel like you spent a hundred bucks more than you should have. 

$$;
Pros:. It's amazing how well it works.. 
Cons:. The set-up isn't a complete "no-brainer" but you can do it.. 
Summary:. First of all, this is a really cool gadget. One thing to note though, there no "record" function with the software, so if you've got visions of using this as a way of transferring video to your iPod, it's not really useful for that, at least out of the box. I'm sure there are people who will figure that piece of the puzzle out eventually.. The video quality looks like decent web video. It's not the quality of your video feed, but it's fine (and as good as I expected) for viewing on the web.. I'm anxiously awaiting the Macintosh version of the software. That's been announced and should arrive in the first half of 2006. I don't know of any plans for a player for the Palm version of the Treo, but that would be great to have too.. 

$$;
Pros:. No monthly charges. No satellite dishes. No duty fees.. 
Cons:. Spastic island DSL connection crashes the video stream.. 
Summary:. This is the best video investment ever for people with vacation homes tucked away in the middle of nowhere. We have an island home in the Caribbean and have paid hundreds of dollars in import duty fees bringing in DirecTV components that we've never been able to make work. The Slingbox isn't perfect, but it IS entertainment. Unfortunately, when the DSL signal hiccups (as it does frequently here) instead of just resuming the stream, the Slingbox signal freezes and then crashes. Fixing that would be a huge plus.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does exactly what it is advertised to do.. 
Cons:. Difficulty setting up before using Sling Link adaptors. 
Summary:. According to the web site if your router and TV source are not in the same room one can use a wireless bridge to connect them, but it didn't work even though I bought one the web site said would work. I then ordered a Sling Link but received a different brand Powerline adaptor (who knows why the wrong thing was sent)which worked intermittently. Then returned it for the Sling Link adaptor which finally worked. Each time I had to call tech support at Sling Media the phone was answered almost immediately and the support staff all were native American English speakers and they talked me through the set up process. All of this problem can be avoided if your router and DVR are in the same room. Mine weren't and there was no way to put them in the same room.. Now it works great.. My son at college can set the DirectTV DVR to record what he wants to watch when he comes home and he can watch Orioles baseball in Philadelphia. I can watch Jon Stewart while on the road.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can watch and control AV devices from anywhere in the world with a broadband connection.. 
Cons:. Must have a decent broadband connection. 
Summary:. I bought this slingbox in anticipation of my recently completed trip to South East Asia. Based on having taken many trips abroad I've been sadly dissappointed, even with satellite these days, the TV/movie selctions in most foreign hotels. I mainly stay in four and five hotels, but that far from garauntees I will find something watchable that is in English. Well with the sling box I was able to keep up with every show I wanted to watch, especially 24.. I did find that if the broadband connection in the hotel was kind of slow or being heavily used the picture quality was diminished severely. High action TV including sports really need a top notch connection to make the show watchable. However, when the connection was not so great, I would simply watch with a smaller screen and the pixelation was not so bad.. I have mine connected to Tivo and I love being able to quickly change my season passes and or add something to record something rather than going to the tivo site to submit a request to record. With the slingbox I can add a recording seconds before the show is about to start.. I also have to add it was very simply to install. You need how to make basic AV connections and have basic computer skills. The directions, to me, very very straight forward.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, good pic quality, free Dynamic DNS. 
Cons:. No software for MAC or Linux yet. 
Summary:. The slingbox is a terrific product. Here is what a potential buyer should know.. 1.) Setup is a piece of cake if you have a standard home network.. 2.) The product works exactly as advertised. Allows you to control and view your Tivo/DVR/TV from anywhere on the internet.. 3.) Picture quality is very good. Primary limitations are the available bandwidth and resolution of the program you're watching. These limitations are independent of the device, however.. 4.) No software for MAC or Linux. This is unfortunate, but I have faith the company will release at least a version for the MAC (as promised on their website).. Overall, I highly recommend the product. Works exactly as advertised -- and this is rare these days.. 

$$;
Pros:. works great with Dirctv had it for about 6months now. 
Cons:. WILL NOT WORK IF YOU HAVE AOL. I went over and over with the techs at slingmedia and aol and linkses,for about 2 months. You have to either have dsl or a browser that is always open.. 
Summary:. Do not buy it if you have aol broadban or if you only going to watch sports. Sports are choppy to see, any thing fast moveing are blochy..

Pros:. Great product and easy set-up. 
Cons:. Often sold out. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, compact, neat and simple to use. 
Cons:. Could be better at slower bandwidth. 
Summary:. A great device to buy. Its a feel at home for people on travel.. 

$$;
Pros:. product does what it says. Nothing more but nothing less. 
Cons:. don't add your future dreams/wish list to this product. 
Summary:. Fun toy. This product does exactly what is expected. The slingbox is connected to a wireless Linksys router via hard wire. The setup was easier than my Dell wireless printers. Had a little trouble with the Directv Remote but that was my fault. The macros channels are a must. Total setup, 1.5 hrs. This a good xmas gift. I do read forums about Treo and others but settle down about "what ifs". This product does what is says. Wish my other products did what they said. Horrid branding and sales campaign. Slingbox product works ad company needs to move on..

Pros:. Great Audio/Video - Fantastic Features - Favorites. 
Cons:. Can Only Use Device On One Computer At A Time. 
Summary:. Well, I've only been using it for about 2 days now and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised and 99% satisfied! (1% is lost on the fact that only one computer can use it at a time.). The quality is top-notch! I thought it might be pixelated, jerky, or buggy - but it isn't. It flows and runs like a regular TV. It just feels like you're watching TV.. Let me also mention all of the features that it has:. * You can watch TV with a full screen and either have the remote on the screen, or not.. * You can hit a button and it will automatically dock to one side of the screen and re-adjust the size of your other windows. And then, you can even fine tune and adjust the size of that window.. * If you just want it to be on your screen and not be docked, you can do that and adjust that screen size as well.. * You can also create a list of favorite channel icons, so all you do is click onto your favorite channel's icon. If the icon doesn't exist - you can create your own!. * It also works with channels like HBO On Demand and with TiVo as well (however, I don't have TiVo).. * If your workplace has a firewall, you can access your home computer using your home computer's IP Address..

Pros:. Easy Setup, Works as Advertised. 
Cons:. Must have a fast connection for it to work. 
Summary:. I sent one of these to a family member up in PA and had them hook it up to the TV (they had a fast internet connection too). Now I get all of the Philly stations and can watch football (Eagles) down here in Florida. Bye Bye Direct TV Sunday Ticket. This thing will pay for itself this year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Take your Tivo with you anywhere in the world. 
Cons:. Average video quality, occasional lag. 
Summary:. This product came at the perfect time for me. We are about to move to a small island off the coast of the UK, and most of our favorite US TV shows aren't available. We struggled with solutions like Tivo to Go, and were ready to give up.... ...until our video guru introduced us to SlingBox. For $250, we can access our Tivo anywhere, including our new remote home. We can not only watch our favorite shows; we can program the Tivo and do pretty much anything we could do if we were in front of it.. The SlingBox was trivial to install - requires connecting a few cables and doing a simple software installation. We had a minor problem with the software, and called SB Support on Saturday afternoon. We got immediate help and a successful resolution to our problem.. The video quality is average or slightly below (depending on the size of the image), and the response to remote control requests is slightly pokey, but considering what this neat little box does, it's well worth the tradeoff.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works great on my wireless connection! Slingbox has software updates, and FIRMWARE updates, Easy SetUp, All Cables Included to get you going. SetUp Manual is minimal and straightforward.. 
Cons:. I don't expect anything from the product, other than what it claims it will do. Few quirks in the installation setup, that I am sure will be updated soon.. 
Summary:. Warning: SlingBox is like a Tivo, once you have one, you can't live without it.. I was very hesitant about purchasing the product for months. I didn't buy it cause it seemed liked there had to be more to it. It was never promoted, stuck in the back of the store on a side shelf and collected dust. No stores have SlingBox on display showing the actual product working. For months SlingBox sat in COMP USA until they started promoting the product in ads. The Burbank COMP USA is out of stock of the SlingBox. I bought the last one. Best Buy sells the product too.. I had a slight problem with my installation. It seems the SlingBox provided A/V in/out cords are not exactly made for each other. It took me an extra hour and a half to finish my installation, due to the faulty connection of the SlingBox A/V cord. I needed to uplug (at the SlingBox) their supplied A/V cord and re-plug it, jiggle it, then I got video/sound. The little installation screen says "Starting", which isn't that informative. The software installation should say "STOP and check your cable connections, if you don't SEE video. Unplug and replug your connections, wait a few seconds for lag to see if you repaired the problem.". Once I got it going, it was smooth. Of course having a good connection is important. If your wireless connection is not rating itself as EXCELLENT, don't blame SlingBox. Even when my SlingBox is using bandwidth streaming at 1288kbps, it doesn't slow down my wireless web browsing! So I can check email, surf, without worrying about my SlingBox hogging ram/bandwidth.. I was surprised that this thing that looks like a toy is capable of FIRMWARE updates. The firmware update was the easiest fireware update I've ever done. Just a few clicks and it was done. You don't unplug, or reset anything! Way-easy! Don't you wish all your toys could be updated via the internet?. My best friend is wanted to buy a wireless TV and has a HP 17" widescreen WindowsMedia XP P4 laptop laying around collecting dust. He already has a wireless lan, and he's has a cable TV box that he uses for himself. I suggested that he purchase a SlingBox, now that I know that the product works, he will love it.. Upon opening the box, I was amazed that all the cords needed are included. I managed to test the SlingBox on the go feature. I hooked up to my SlingBox successfully through a neighbors unsecure wireless connection (without any port fordarding). The wireless connection to my laptop showed excellent, and so was the video.. If you want to hear a little nit-pick about SlingBox, the color and shape-design that makes it look like a cheap toy. The SlingBox rear side is red plastic, with gold lettering indicating the titles of the jacks. Bad color combinations(gold on red) for those with imperfect eyesight. SlingBox is not a replacement for a high quality TV, so if you don't mind the occasional jerk in motion when your wireless connection has a drop in transmissions, then you'll continue to enjoy the product. I am running a HP laptop with a Centrino processor and it is great. I also reccomend those who plan to use a SlingBox on a regular basis to use it with a HP laptop that has Altec Lansing speakers on the front side(not top) of the laptop, so the sound projects toward you. The sound is great when laptop was created with great sound in mind. If your laptop has tiny little tin-can sounding speakers (such as on Toshiba laptops)under your laptop screen, then you should consider running out and get a new HP laptop. I will never own a new laptop model that doesn't have speakers on the front side of the laptop.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works equally well on DSL and cable broadband.. 
Cons:. no provisions to minimize screen to just the picture.. 
Summary:. I have been using this slingbox for about a month now and from my house to my office the connection is great. As I write this review I am watching tv at the same time. The only thing I find wrong is that if you use the RCA plugs for connecting a DVD player you cannot use the cable (rf) connection to feed cable to the box also. It is a bit pricey, but consider that you only pay for it one time. You can have more then one slingbox hooked up to the same network also (I currently have 2 different ones) so you can stream to more then one computer .. 

$$;
Pros:. TV or DVR access anywhere there's broadband. 
Cons:. Program Guide / Menu viewing for Digital Cable Boxes?. 
Summary:. Interesting.....I've been experimenting with it all last night.. I bought the last one in the store....its a very hot item.. I'll be honest.....once it's running its performance is pretty slick and the video quality is excellent even at medium broadband speeds. This is an amazing product for those that travel alot and especially internationally (granted foreign ISPs don't eventually put up barriers to it) and the fact it works with Dynamic IPs.....is astounding. This is also a great solution to add TV to the computer room if you didn't want to drop a cable or drill holes in the wall.. Tested it fully at a T-Mobile Hotspot with full WPA/TSIK Encryption......Firewall restrictions with UPnP Traffic would seem to be the major impediment of using it in public....but it performed excellent...the people at the table next to me were amazed by it.. Video has about a 5-6 second delay from source video. Things still needed to test:. Need to test it with a 802.11g connection w/ WEP.......it didn't work too well in my test with a Linksys 802.11b Wireless Bridge (WET11) with Encryption on (video tears, staticy to no audio)....but the wireless bridge I used was specifically mentioned on their support site as not a good one to use with it.. With the SLINGBOX connected directly to Router = Flawless video with the quality peaking at 1.3mbps Downstream.. Pretty good video quality even at only 300 - 500kbps downstream.. Need to gauge to how it performs on DSL vs Cable Modem.. Limitations..... Only 1 person can connect to it at one time however...as I tested with a desktop and a laptop at same time which resulted in a conflict.. Only one device per SLINGBOX but the form factor definitely makes them stackable.. Comcast Program Guide &#38; Cable Box Menu's do not appear with either Coaxial or Composite Video.....I will try S-Video. Then again you can access local Cable Program Guides on the Web. This may be my error as its an HD Box set to 1080i output and I'm using the analog outputs.. Haven't tested it with the full Comcast Digital Cable DVR combo.....but so far so good but if you can't see the guide or menu then might be best for a digital tuner only. Should work great with a TIVO as it is specifically mentioned in the manual. I'll be testing it with my Panasonic DVR soon.. Contrary to the BOX.....Windows XP Home/Pro/MCE are not absolutely mandatory......It does work with Windows 2000 as long as you have SP4, Direct X 9.0c and Windows Media 9 Codecs installed. Don't think there's a client for MAC OS X.. Right now this thing is getting product of the year IMO.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can watch daytime baseball from work!. 
Cons:. Will drop connection on occasion. 
Summary:. This is a very cool and somewhat pricey gadget. I will be using this from Germany so I can get access to American TV. It has worked great so far, but I have yet to hook it up to my Tivo. Easy to set up. I did not have to configure my router at all for it to open a port to stream the audio and video. I recommend this to anyone who travels and likes to get local tv news and sporting events.. 

$$;
Pros:. Setup was easy if you upgrade your router's firmware first. 
Cons:. If your UPLOAD speed is less than 100kbs, forget it. 
Summary:. works from my home in Chicago to my apartmemt in Europe. I have a tivo Series 1 and was jelous of the series 2 features but, didn't want to buy a new Lifetime subscription... This does it and more.. But, what you see is a function of your upload speed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Use your TiVo, cable or satellite remotely. 
Cons:. None that I can think of.. 
Summary:. If you have installed a router or cable modem or dvd player you can install the Slingbox.. For many years I've had issues at work of not being able to get a tv signal because of the buildings construction, I've tried all sorts of powered antennas and no luck. Now that the Slingbox is available I can remotely view AND control my Directv TiVo box.. I can also regain the control I lost when I gave up my "stand alone" series 2 TiVo since I can now schedule programs [or season passes] and anything else I could only do at home.. The faster your connection the better the picture and sound however I'm even able to use the Slingbox with an ISDN connection at work [128k under the best conditions], granted I'm watching a smaller window on my desktop but it works for me. In the next 60 days I'll be connected to a 768k cable modem and it should really sing then.. When using the Slingbox at home and viewing from a different room over my wireless network the video and audio are very watchable on my laptop full screen - if I wanted to I could also feed the signal out to my WEGA 32" and watch it remotely that way also.. In the 6 weeks that I've owned the Slingbox the software has already been upgraded twice and the most recent upgrade vastly improved the way the TiVo remote works - it even looks like the famous TiVo "peanut".. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy set-up, surprisingly good picture, definite conversation piece. 
Cons:. Needs to be available for viewing on Palm/Pocket PCs. 
Summary:. At first, I had some serious apprehension about the Sling claims. Having "watched" blocky, jerky and out of sync video on Real or Windows Media, I was not expecting much. After following the simple-as-dirt Slingbox installation, I was surprised how quickly I was able to watch a very acceptable picture and sound. Once booted up, after a few seconds to syncronize, I was watching a perfectly acceptable TV program on my laptop. Well not only me but half of the passengers waiting for our flight. It is kinda cool to see the local news and weather at your destination (if its home) while sitting in a departure louge thousands of miles away.. The other big sanity saver it offers is at hotels with their four or five over-the-air TV stations featuring quilting or hog tying specials: now you can reconnect with civilization wit a simple mouse click.. The Slingbox has it own tuner for basic cable which means you don't need to watch whatever they are watching at home unless you want cable channels above 100 when the cable box is in control (the Slingox comes with a remote control adapter to tune the cable box as well but them everyone is watching the same program).. I woulds highly recommend it for frequent travellers as you can always feel close to home.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does exactly what they say with simple installation. 
Cons:. Agreed - stupid that you can't change inputs remotely; good, but limited video quality.. 
Summary:. I have purchased three and put them in three different countries (different homes and businesses) to keep up with news and local programming where I work and play. It is very simple to install (ask my wife), and it plays without interruption on various speed links, adjusting quality on the fly to ensure smooth audio and video. They offer the software free to anyone who wants to download it, but admittedly, I would like to see a browser plugin. It could use a wireless option - did not play nice with my D-Link wireless 802.11 bridge. Otherwise, I would suggest a little work on the software and improved video quality on LAN/fast links. I couldn't get it to stream at over 550Kbps. A great innovation from a company who's top management and tech support seem extremell responsive and down-to-earth.. Missed a 10 based only on minor complaints listed under cons above.... 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup. Love the ability to view my TV from the road. 
Cons:. A little grainy. 
Summary:. Purchased the slingbox after a review on this website. Installed it this morning. Install took about 15 minutes and it worked flawlessly. I have a DLink router and analog cable so the setup couldn't have been simpler. I was so excited to test it, I took my laptop to a local wifi McDonalds to watch CNN while I ate lunch. How cool! I travel for a living. Can't wait to use this on the road.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to instal software. Works with any TV set-up.. 
Cons:. Will need to buy a wifi adapter or need it near your router to connect it to your network.. 
Summary:. This is great for anyone who travels frequently for work. The cost of this device is easily justified after the first airport delay. Most major airports are now offering wifi service, so being able to catch up on my Tivo'd shows or just watching real tv while waiting for a flight takes the sting out airport delays. For those who don't travel, With my homes wifi, I can watch a baseball game while tinkering in the garage or the basement or just outside the house.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Video Quality and Easy Setup. 
Cons:. Nothing really at this point. 
Summary:. This is a great product! It's not perfect but close.. It delivers exactly what it promises to do.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use and simple to customize using multiple inputs. 
Cons:. Video Quality fades when using FULL SCREEN MODE. 
Summary:. When setting this up the novice user may need techical support assistance. However there customer service/tech suppport staff are Very friendly and knowledgable. Qnce you experience this ingenous device you'll wonder why it wasn't created sooner. a true joy to own.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works as advertised, easy setup. 
Cons:. No Wi-fi support. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup with my wireless router (54g). 
Cons:. A long wait for the product. 
Summary:. After following this thing since CES I finally found one - the last one - at CompUSA in San Francisco. It took no time at all to hook up, but make sure you read the box. I had to also buy a pair of powerline ethernet adapters because of the setup in my apartment.. I spent most of the afternoon showing people in the office how I can now watch my Tivo from the laptop and they were blown away. The video quality was very good too. Some of the reviews I've seen are a little critical of the video, I'm watching the Tivo IN MY HOUSE. How cool is that!. This may be a whole new idea for Starbucks, latte and TV (Sling are you listening?).. 

$$;
Pros:. you need high bandwidth. 
Cons:. you need high bandwidth. 
Summary:. I bought a Slingbox and hooked it up to my home network via a wireless bridge. and love it. It was easy to hook up, I get beautiful sound and picture from my. cable at home while at work or on the road. Its a great product... You can get. more details on this website. &lt;a href="http://www.mobilephones-info.com/SlingBox.htm"&gt;. http://www.mobilephones-info.com/SlingBox.htm&lt;/a&gt;. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Set-up/good customer service/tech support. 
Cons:. No Mac version as of now. 
Summary:. Great item. I have had my Sling Box since last summer. I was able to cancel my cable subscription at my office and just use the Sling to see news or anything else. It has allready paid for itself. If possible Sling should look into having a built in tunner chip for controls. The IR plug can get bumped out of place and leave you without control.. 

$$;
Pros:. This now supports mac OSX as well as mobile OS's. 
Cons:. I can't really see a need for this. When I am out of my house I don't want to watch TV and the whole airport thing is cool, but most airports charge for their Wi-Fi.. 

$$;
Pros:. no-brainer installation; literally takes 5 minutes. 
Cons:. delayed remote response with my Tivo. 
Summary:. The Sling Box is a great little device. I normally keep my laptop bedside for those sleepless nights. Now I can watch t.v. via my Tivo without dragging myself to the next room or purchasing an addtional t.v. for my already cramped bedroom. It is difficult to nail the exact second to hit the play button on the Tivo after fast-forwarding through commercials, as there is an unavoidable delay sending the remote signal over the net. Otherwise, no complaints. A must for frequent travelers.. 

$$;
Pros:. Latest build improves video stream quality. Works as advertised. 
Cons:. For use on the road, limited by your internet upload speed and the quality of the hotel network (which is questionable as to what they claim is hi-speed). 
Summary:. I have the device hooked up to my Tivo. When on the road, hotel internet speed is the key. Very cool and weird to control your Tivo box from a different state. The latest build improves on video quality, plus you now can set up quick launch channels. As internet provider upload speeds increase, the quality of the video will get better and better. As far as full screen,unless your expecting DVD quality, it works well. Setup is easy (real easy with a unPnP router). Overall I highly recommend for the person who is on the road and wants to get the most from the $75 monthly cable bill they pay for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excelente para uso en la oficina. 
Cons:. Si no hay DSL o Superior en el area no tiene uso. 
Summary:. Excelente equipo y una de las mejores inversiones que e hecho hasta ahora. Necesita mas ajustes en el sistema ya que deberia de haber una manera de que funcione sin tener que buscar una conexion de banda ancha de internet si es que estoy en un area donde no hay internet disponible, sugiero satelite.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, watch your local TV anywhere. 
Cons:. don't expect a perfect picture. 
Summary:. Really nice when you travel far from home. Worth every penny.. Don't expect the same quality picture as in your living room.. I watched my local cable channels from Hong Kong and mainland China last month. I couldn't believe the content made it through the Chinese internet police.. Due to my connect speed -- the slingbox was not good for action movies, but was great for local news and regular non-high-action shows.. It was amazing to change channels from half way around the world -- and it only took seconds.. Found the picture clarity better when I used a TV as a monitor(rather than on my laptop screen).. 

$$;
Pros:. Its TV everywhere!!!. 
Cons:. No List button yet (u know the 1 for saved shows on DVR). 
Summary:. Go run to the store - this box is worth getting it. It will only take half an hour to setup - after that it will entertain you wild.. They should have released it a year ago (thats when it 1st hit the news) so that now we would have second version with HDTV, wireless &#38; Multiple input device support.. 

$$;
Pros:. We plan to set this up in Chicago so we can stream Chicago sports from New York and abroad.. 
Cons:. Doesn't work completely with our Time Warner Scientific Atlanta. Either the tv has to be on or we have to unplug the HDMI cable in order to stream it remotely. It's not Sling Media's fault but more an issue on the cable box side.. 
Summary:. For us we only really use it to stream sports from the Palm Centro, and for setting up the DVR to record if you've forgotten something. But if you travel, are a tv or sports junkie, you have to try this product, you'll love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Wicked Easy Setup. 
Cons:. Only as good as your internet connection. 
Summary:. This product allows me to access live television at my office where cable and satelite is not an option. One little thing most people don't know is it has a built in TV tuner so you don't need to connect it to your existing components. I just plugged straight cable into it and then plugged it into my home network and I was broadcasting.. 

$$;
Pros:. EASY setup, local and remote clients work great. 
Cons:. Only works with one client at a time. 
Summary:. This gadget would be better if multiple clients could connect simultaneously.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy Set Up, Good Software. 
Cons:. Bad Tech Support, Hard to Set up with multiple networks, No Built In Wireless. 
Summary:. This is a good product. However, it still needs a little work and with it i think that it would be really great. 

$$;
Pros:. Works great when it works.. 
Cons:. Networked using TurboLink is horrible. Buy Power Network from Netgear if needed.. 
Summary:. Great product when it works but the worst technical support ever. Its once thing to have horrible support but these guys want to charge you extra now for horrible support. I got my device which was not cheap (Pro) last year and used thier own TurboLink for network connection. I sent then emails and called them that it would freeze and then stop working from the Sling Catcher but would work fine on the Sling Player from a PC. They said we will look into it and will get back to me. 3 months later after followups, nothing. So the device "Slingcatcher" which was not cheap either was a paper weight since December till today. I call them and they say sorry we didnt get back to you before and we will look into it but for this call you will need to pay x amount to get support or extend warrenty... I can understand if you are buying a $10 device to support like this but to pay $200 + and only give 90 day support is just ridculous.. If you buy this your on your own.. 

$$;
Pros:. The ability to watch television anytime from anywhere on your computer. 
Cons:. The picture quality is poor. 
Summary:. One of the most talked about gadgets this year has to be the Slingbox which is produced by Sling Media. I have been familiar with Slinbox for quite some time and have found it very intriguing. Slingbox claims that it transforms Windows XP based PCs and laptops into personal on the go digital TVs. It then allows individuals anywhere at any time to access their own television experience with no additional monthly service fee. This enables consumers to watch their cable, satellite or DVR programming from wherever they are. When I first heard about the product I was very skeptic about the picture quality as it is streamed from over the internet.. I decided to give Slinbox a try as I do find there device very intriguing. Unfortunately, the Slinbox did not turn out as great as I thought it would be. Usually I am skeptic about new technology because they have not worked out all the kinks yet. Cars are usually infamous for this as first year models are always advised against purchasing because you dont know what you are getting yourself into. I find it useful to let new technology pan out for a while to make sure you are not making a mistake in a new purchase. In addition, there are usually numerous problems and kinks they did not catch the first time around. I believe the Slingbox can work on there idea and product and turn it into something really useful and cool, but until then I do not believe it is worth purchasing unless you do not mind watching TV with poor quality that you are used to viewing on the internet.. 

$$;
Pros:. It Works unlike other products (Sony Location Free Player Pack).. 
Cons:. Changing the channel on your laptop also changes the channel of the T.V. that it streams from. Vice versa, if someone changes the channel from the T.V. the channel your're watching changes.. 
Summary:. Product does what it says it will do. Only issue is the Channel Changing conflict. But overall the product is okay!. 

$$;
Pros:. It works just as they say it should.. 
Cons:. Price, Purpose &#38; Function. 
Summary:. If you have any knowledge at all about networking you can do all these features with a standard PC instead of wasting your money on this, I have my setup with MCE and it works like a chizarm.. topmoo. 

$$;
Pros:. Price. Does what it claims to do... watch TV,DVD,Tivo, whatever wherever.. 
Cons:. Periodic loss of connection, even on home network.... 
Summary:. I hope to be able to edit this review someday soon to up my rating from a 6 to something higher. However, right now I am experiencing some problems maintaing a solid connection to my slingbox. Initially everything just worked. After setup, I was able to watch my Tivo on my laptop from anywhere in my house. Unfortunely, it seems that I loose my video stream fairly regularly now... whether I am connected to my home network via wireless, or wired in to my router directly over ethernet. I am pretty experienced with networking so I am confident that I have properly configured the slingbox and my home network. Nonetheless, I can't rule out the possibility that the problem is related to my router. This seems unlikely however because I have managed to find a work around... I rolled back the firmware on the slingbox (by holding the reset button down for 5 seconds) and reverted my pc software to the version that shipped with the unit on a CDROM. Since this rollback I seem to be getting a far more reliable connection, although it still occasionally goes out. After talking to the very helpful help desk at slingbox, I was told that some slingboxes are having problems like this and they offered to send me a new unit. Actually I am going to check if the retail store I bought it from will exchange mine first. I believe that any slingbox you are likely to find in stores now will NOT be from the bad batch that I apparently got. Check the sling media website for info on this (I think you can tell if your unit is suspect by the serrial number). Anyway, it seems like the network card in my slingbox might be the culprit, but as I said above I can not rule out my own router/home network setup. Despite this issue, I still highly recomend the slingbox, because even if you have problems, the company is really helpful and seems willing to send you a new unit with out any hassle.. Good luck to all.. 

$$;
Pros:. actually does work. 
Cons:. tricky remote use set-up, variable video quality. 
Summary:. First, kudos to a product that actually works. I had my doubts but after the lengthy set-up process, it actually works as stated. HOWEVER, I think for the money, this product should be better. The set-up is quite complicated if you do not have a plug-n-play router for remote viewing. The screen size is quite smaller than a normal size screen (you can make it larger with very bad video reproduction being the result) The video is a bit jerky depending on the stream bit rate. It's a cool concept, but if you are thinking you will get a good cable tv picture quality ...........don't buy this product. The video quality is not worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. It works as advertised. 
Cons:. LocationFreeTV is better and doesn't interfere with TV watchers at home. 
Summary:. Setup was easy and it works as advertised, but if you want to use it while somebody is watching TV at home I hope you both want to watch the same program... LocationFreeTV doesn't have this downfall and it includes wireless connectivity over your network that provides a better picture. I've got both products and use them both, but prefer the Sony product.. 

$$;
Pros:. resonable price, great video quality, great hardware. 
Cons:. no browser plug-in, only 1 stream at the time, only one of the 3 available inputs can be used, way too few remote codes. 
Summary:. I bought the unit beginning of June '05 right after it came out. When I installed it I was disappointed that it was missing the remote control codes for most of my equipment. For the few devices that were in the list, the codes didn't work. The technical support was not able to give me any hints.. Another problem is that you can only watch the stream on one computer at the time and you need to install their software. I am asking myself why there is no browser plug-in.. A major flaw in the design is that the box has 3 inputs, but the software doesn't let you switch them on the fly. How stupid is that!!!. In my opinion the software sucks! They need to have a broser plug-in that allows you to have a interface to control multiple devices and switch the inputs.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just a good idea. 
Cons:. Spend too much time reconfiguring. 
Summary:. I keeep having to get someone at the home computer to reset the thing from its beggining installation. I would have to say it would not be wise to think this will work every time you want to watch tv far from home. 

$$;
Pros:. Surprisingly good streaming picture quality. 
Cons:. Remote viewing doesn't work reliably. 
Summary:. I travel on business fairly often and find hotel-room TVs usually pretty mediocre, both in terms of channel lineup and picture quality. So the Slingbox promise of being able to access the HD digital cable programming I have at home from anywhere on the Internet really appealed to me. In other words, I bought the Slingbox Pro solely for its "remote viewing" feature, and in that I've been disappointed. It's a great idea that *almost* works.. The first problem I encountered was getting the SlingPlayer app on my laptop (a Dell Inspiron E1505), which is what I take on the road with me, to be able to "see" the Slingbox back at home. This involved some fairly low-level configuration of my home wireless access point/router and my DSL modem/router (I didn't even know my DSL moden *was* a router) having to do with "port forwarding" and a lot of other network arcana. I will concede that everything one needs to know to do this is on the Slingbox support website, but the instructions are poorly organized; they're scattered around under various hyperlinked topics and hard to find.. But once I was able to get SlingPlayer to communicate with the Slingbox, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the picture streamed over the Internet from the latter to the former. The picture wasn't hi def by any means, but was nevertheless eminently watchable: Motion was smoothly rendered, color was good, and picture sharpness and detail were acceptable.. Unfortunately -- and this is my biggest complaint -- the connection between SlingPlayer and the Slingbox has proven to be extremely tenuous -- it breaks every five minutes or so. In other words, about every five minutes, the picture displayed by SlingPlayer either freezes or goes blank (and the audio cuts out too). It's easy enough to get it going again -- one simply has to stop and restart SlingPlayer. But there's a 15 or 20 second delay before streaming resumes (it takes that long to re-establish the connection and fill up the video buffer), which obviously makes for a choppy and unsatisfying viewing experience.. A similar problem occurs when I try to use SlingPlayer to remotely control the video source back at home -- a Tivo Series 3 DVR in my case. Frequently (but not always), sending a remote control command will also cause the connection to hang, requiring a SlingPlayer restart to get it going again as above.. Naturally I tried contacting Slingbox tech support, first by email and subsequently by phone. The various tech support people I spoke to seemed genuinely concerned and sorry for my troubles, but for all that were unable to diagnose or fix the problem -- even though they could easily reproduce it by connecting to my Slingbox from their offices, which I gather are in Oregon (I'm in New Jersey). The best they could do was offer to exchange the unit, which I'm loath to do simply because it's such a hassle packing it up, schlepping it to the UPS store, and shipping it back to them. Also, I'm not entirely convinced the fault is in the Slingbox itself, since everything works flawlessly when both the SlingPlayer and the Slingbox are on the same local area network (i.e., my home network). I suspect there's some subtle incompatibility between the Slingbox and one or more of the myriad network devices that shuttle the packets between the unit in my living room at home and the SlingPlayer in a hotel room when I'm on the road.. The tech support people implied my problem was rare (first they'd ever heard of it). Frankly I fouund this a bit disingenuous since the Slingbox user forums (which I stupidly didn't think to check out until *after* I bought the gadget) are replete with similar complaints.. So, my advice to anyone enamored of the remote viewing concept who may be thinking of buying a Slingbox, is to hold off for a few months, keep an eye on the user forums, and wait until the bugs are worked out, as I'm sure they eventually will be.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good technology to be in touch with tv. 
Cons:. needs new program to run on pc. 
Summary:. very good resolution in samall aspect ratio. but poor picture quality in full screen option.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great concept, I've been using it for 3 years. I have two units, bought within a month of each other. I use it in the house and on the road.. 
Cons:. One major flaw outweighs all. The quality of the power adapters is junk, and possibly a fire hazard. BOTH units had the adapters fail. start buzzing, and get dangerously hot. The first one the replaced. The second one they refuse to acknowledge.. 
Summary:. I was impressed that they replaced the adapter out of warranty. I was less imressed when the second one also failed. Although the problem was identical, they claim that since it's not one of the serial numbers they acknowledged, they refuse to replace it... and they are not interested in researching to see if this is another bad unit (i.e., more of them are bad than they admit, and they don't care). They want me to buy another for $20. But if they don't acknowledge that the problem is more widespread, how can I believe that the replacement is any good?. I'm concerned that it could've caused a fire, and since it's intended to run unattended, it could burn down my house while I'm out of town. The plastic was hot to touch; unplugged it and the metal was TOO HOT to touch. After I gave them several chances to make good, I reported them to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (sure seems like a fire hazard to me).. I'm about to replace one of the units with a Hava; I hear it's better, and I'll see.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, it's great but......... 
Cons:. It is TOTALLY unreliable. I am in France now (June 2009) and was counting on watching the NBA Finals with Slingbox. It worked when I left home, worked in another part of France and now I can't control the Slingbox despite great internet conection.. 
Summary:. I have not experienced RELIABILITY without which the product has little value at this time. I cool concept but not ready for primetime.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up and use. 
Cons:. They encrypted the stream - recoding now impossible. 
Summary:. Sling Media took a winner of a product and "enhanced" it by encrypting the media stream. This nifty feature was a hidden consequence of a firmware upgrade they pushed on owners last month. As a result, the ability to record a media stream for later playback is now taken away.. This seems to be the first time I've known a supplier to downgrade a customers service and product capability after the device was purchased. That they did it in such a sneaky manner says much about the companies committment to the customer.. I'd advise you look at the Monsoon HAVA instead!. ASTROBUF!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great for the wireless pc on the go and in home Media pc. 
Cons:. a slap in the face to mac owners everywhere. 
Summary:. my con says it all... when i heard of the sling box, i thought i could put together the perfect media center, once apple put Front Row on on the macmini. I have the 30" display, and all i wanted to do now is to have the ability to put TV to it. I'm sure that they will come with a product for a mac like this soon, and i will be patient until then. 

$$;
Pros:. this is junk. 
Cons:. customer service is from mars. couldn't tie their shoes. this is a junk product for the money - don't waste your time...best buy should be ashamed of carrying this junk. 
Summary:. this isn't worth ten bucks, never mind the hundreds of dollars that they are asking for this product...don't waste your time. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well with LANs.. 
Cons:. Does not work over the internet from most locations.. 
Summary:. If you try to use it from a wireless network that has any kind of security (like almost all hotels or other public places), it will not work. If you phone them, they will tell you that's why it doesn't work. It also does not work with broadband cards. So, effectively, it does not work any place you might really want to use it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I hear great things about it. Unfortunately I have not gotten it to work.. 
Cons:. We tried to install it with customer support about 18 months to 2 years ago on a Mac network. It crashed the network and we had to replace the router. They said at the time they were working on fixes for Mac. We put it in the closet.. 
Summary:. I have been hearing that Slingbox now works well with Mac. I tried to install it and the system did not crash it even recognized the box on the network, however when I went to configure it , it says it can't find it. I called Sling Media. They say it does not matter that they could not get it to work the first time. Since it is over 90 days, I have to pay $30 to get them to help be set up the product.. Way to win back a customer. You know I was not mad when it did not work the first time, I just chalked it up to new tech and waited for it to bake.. Now I am angry. I bought a product from these guys that did not work and they really want be to pay them to find out if they can make it work now. Not really great customer service. All I can say is Buyer Beware.. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much. Worthless 99% of the time. 
Cons:. See the pros.. 
Summary:. Used it 5 times in 5 years. Actually getting it to work takes many hours every time I have tried it. Usually after hours of troublshooting, it works, then the next time I come back, all the same old problems. Worst product I have ever wasted money on.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Product if it works. Mine worked for 3 months and the software died, not the hardware. There software conflicts with some Antivirus softwares. If it does, it won't connect. There online help chat couldnt even get through firewall.. 
Cons:. You run risk of losing $300 investment. They only support software for 3 months. Software died 3 months to the day while downloading an update from them. Waived support fee, but couldn't fix. I lose $300.. 
Summary:. Certain Antivirus software conflict with SlingPlayer Software. Company does not view this as their problem, but yours. You may get an antivirus update in 3 months or 6 months that conflicts and then you'll lose $300 investment in product. P.S. It was a great product for the 3 months it worked.. 

$$;
Pros:. My Slingbox AV was good while it worked.. 
Cons:. Recently, while 2500 miles from home and my Slingbox AV, I was prompted that I was required to update firmware, in order to continue use. Update FAILED. Tech support say only way to fix is go to location of Slingbox!!! I now have a doorstop!. 

$$;
Pros:. It's a great idea..... 
Cons:. Not compatible with most tuners. 
Summary:. I purchased a sligbox player recently, and couldn't wait to be able to go away for work, and never miss my home sports teams on TV again! And best of all, I could put it on my bedroom TV so my viewing would not disturb my family when away.. WRONG!!!. My first problem is that the unit lacks a tuner, as do most devices today. Luckily most VCRs have built in tuners thanks to the way they could record shows when you program them. After trying both a Toshiba and Samsung VCR, I was very disturbed to find that both units were completely incompatible. Even my new Zenith DVD/VCR combo is not compatible!. The only things in my house that are compatible are my Scientific Atlanta cable box and my Tivo. Both are connected to the family TV, and to put the slingbox on that Television defeats part of my purpose in buying it. If I connect it to those, my viewing while away could disturb my family who is still at home.. I'm now left with a decision, either return this product, or go out and buy another unit with a tuner that is compatible, unfortunately nothing my local retailers carry seems to even be compatable with slingbox. Even at the Best Buy where I purchased it! So now it's either I return it, or buy something that is on the compatability list over the internet.. My advice is to just get a DVR/Tivo, record your shows, and wait to get home to watch them.. 

$$;
Pros:. none of redeeming value to deaf. 
Cons:. It appears to have no CC ability. 
Summary:. The CNET reviewer forgot to mention anything about if it has closed captioning required by the Americans Disability Act as it applies to ALL telecommunications devices (not just TV's). Nothing new here. Hearing people just don't think of older people with poor hearing or totally deaf. How rude CNET is. The heck with them.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazon has an easy no-hassle return policy. 
Cons:. Waited more than 30 minutes to reach a person and they didn't know what they were doing. 
Summary:. I hooked up the slingbox in minutes and the directions are excellent. However, it was impossible to activate remote viewing (only reason one would use this product) and called tech support at 6:40pm PST and finally reached a person at 7:10PST and we were on the phone until 8:15pmPST and it never worked - he really was a nice guy but was unsure what the heck he was doing, how to deactivate the firewall, confirm I.P. address...he tried a bunch of different things and eventually he gave up and it was too late to speak with another tech as they were all leaving. The quality of the tech support is disappointing and to wait so long to reach someone makes it worse. What a huge waste of time.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's inexpensive, and a novelty gadget. 
Cons:. Poor quality video. 
Summary:. Being able to watch your TV from anywhere in the world is a cool idea, but don't get so caught up with the idea that you forget to actually look at what you're watching.. Slingbox will give you something that sort of looks like your TV, but it can't deliver the quality.. With all the raving reviews about this box, I'm surprised no one has said anything about TV2Me...the one product that does deliver TV quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. when it works it works well. 
Cons:. Not compatible with new Direct TV sat receivers. 
Summary:. It made me furious to find out that the slingbox that I just bought is not compatible with Direct TV. If you have a D10-200 one of the new boxes you are out of luck. Customer svc states update is in the works, however that does me no good.. 

$$;
Pros:. not much at all. 
Cons:. Slingbox pro-HD works only about 10% of the time. 
Summary:. I use this to watch my US cable subscription from overseas where I live. This is not practicle as it takes so much resetting of the system in the US that you had better have someone there to accomplish this. Maybe it's a problem specific to me, but I wouldn't bet on it. This is a fairly expensive product and it should work a lot better. You can not get any help from tech support unless you are at the spot where the slingbox is.. All in all I am very dissapointed with this. 

$$;
Pros:. none, the design looks sleek but who cares because it is not a good product.. 
Cons:. most of all everything. there is no customer support, there is no value in the product, you will want to throw it out the window by the time you make your first miserable IT call. It has the worst customer support I have ever experienced.. 
Summary:. it takes forever to set up, every week there is a new error. The customer support does not exist at all. You call, they make you pay $29 for each support call, they will not respond at the time but they send you a support email, which is supposed to contain information for help. It never does. Then you call back and they want you to pay $29 again, they do not understand their own system and they shoot you back and forth between departments. I would not wish this product on anyone. don't bother getting the warranty, it is the biggest scam of all. It really is the worst company I have ever worked with, getting support from them makes you feel insane. Honestly don't buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works it is fine but. 
Cons:. Lots of problems and not a good system setup. Works intermittently! Can't get iphone to work on it. Don't buy from third party since you won't have a warranty and slingbox people will charge you big time every time you call with a question.. 
Summary:. Think again about buying. Someday someone will have a more reliable system?. 

$$;
Pros:. When the Slingbox is connected, the remote is configured, and your internet speed is great, the picture is adequate enough to enjoy your home cable at remote locations.. 
Cons:. Tech support is non-existent. After 90 days, forget about tech support and you will need it.. 
Summary:. Tech support is in Costa Rica. I moved my slingbox to a different location and needed support with internet viewing. After 90 days they charge you $29. I paid and after they connected it told me that I would need to pay them an additional $29 to set up the remote. I assumed that configuring the remote was a natural step in establishing remote viewing. In the eyes of slingbox, I was wrong. Save yourself the time and money and watch TV and download movies online. Sling box is not worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Package looks sleek and smooth. 
Cons:. Could not get it to work, tech support wanted to charge me to make it work after I had already spent $376 for their product. I ended up filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau, where it turns out they already had a grade of an F.. 
Summary:. I received a Sling Box Pro HD player Christmas 2008. I was able to activate my account in January. However, I have not been able to successfully hook it up ever. Last week I bought a Sling Link, thinking that would solve my problem. Still it doesn't work. I called tech support and they wanted to charge me for making the product work. $376 has already spent on this company and there is nothing to show for it. They want more. I explained my situation to Mayling, August 4, shortly before 7pm pacific time, Id# 2715503. She would not transfer me to someone who I could escalate the issue with. I told her I would complain to BBB if no one would help me. Its gotten to the point where I am upset enough to start telling my friends this product is worthless. I am also going to begin posting this complaint on websites. The company does not seem to care about their customers.. 

$$;
Pros:. That it lasted at least 4 months before it broke.. 
Cons:. Terrible customer service, poorly designed software.. 
Summary:. They want me to pay $30 to help fix the box after they broke with their update.. 

$$;
Pros:. there are none. 
Cons:. complicated, horrible instructions. 
Summary:. This is a terrible product in my opinion. The documentation is poor and it doesn't work at all for me. Tech support was horrible. Long wait times and always looking to blame it on your operating system, router or firewall.. They really don't care that you spent 200-300 dollars on something that doesn't work.. I am pretty computer savy, but after following their instruction and opening ports in the router, it still didn't work. I am tired of waiting over an hour for tech support or having someone poking around my computer. 

$$;
Pros:. They are working on the OS X support at this time which is a good thing. 
Cons:. They do not infact support OS X at this stage. False adverting on their part. 
Summary:. Have a read for yourself regarding Sling Media and OS X Support:. http://www.i4u.com/article6882.html. 

$$;
Pros:. good idea if it worked correctly. 
Cons:. it has terrible documentation and way to complicated of a setup. 
Summary:. Let me start by saying I don't normally write reviews especially bad ones but this needed to be said. THIS IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS IT IS MADE OUT TO BE. I have been here about 10 hours trying to set this thing up and the closest have gotten is a picture and sound on my laptop that was connected to the same router. What they don't tell you on all of the oh how simple and great this is reviews is if you use VOIP or more than one router, you are screwed. I have destroyed and rebuilt my network 2-3 times just trying to get this thing to do what is supposed to do (transmit my television over the internet.) As of right now I ham putting it down 10 hours is enough and the patronizing help menu they have only adds to the frustration. I would suggest that sling media 1. make the product set up a little easier, or 2 give better documentation so people can follow what is going wrong 3. offer more customer service or 4. mark this product for the extremely computer and network savvy because if you don't know how to open and close the specific ports needed and forward the IP addresses and alter all of that stop you might end up like me 10 hours and nothing to show but frustration.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. 
Cons:. Cant use it!. 
Summary:. I have been asking local stores and searching for info on websites to see if I, being part of a deaf family, should purchase the Slingbox. It is a very cool idea but if it does not support Closed Captioning I cant use it.. 

$$;
Pros:. picture looks good and no crappy.. 
Cons:. No Closed Caption decoder. 
Summary:. I do not recommend to buy it since there is no closed caption for Deaf and Hard Hearing customers. I'm not able to understand what TV said because I can't hear and no closed caption. I did call the tech support and they said this product does not offer it. So, Deaf and Hard Hearing should not buy this..
