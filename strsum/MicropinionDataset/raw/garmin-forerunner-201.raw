$$;
Pros:. Excellent value and works much better than Timex versions. 
Cons:. none, this is a must for anyone doing any serious running logs. 

$$;
Pros:. Found a great site has them for $134. I ordered one for my wife who is the runner in the family. Definitely check out www.scubasteve.biz he has great prices and was very helpful on the phone. I can't wait to surprise my wife.. 
Cons:. I'll give you a full review on the product as soon as it arrives.. 

$$;
Pros:. Virtual Partner. 
Cons:. There are none yet. 
Summary:. Just bought a Forerunner 201 from Ebay a week ago. Many sellers available. Under $100 for reconditioned unit from factory and 1 year warranty. Love the Virtual Partner! Set the pace and distance and off you go against your opponent. Watch as it keeps track of your progress against your partner. No problem with GPS. Ran one of my routes that I had marked off with my vehicles odometer, and it was only off a couple steps! I had no problem downloading the information to my computer. Nice graphs and map route info. Even though the unit is larger than your watch. You can't even tell that it is on your wrist while running. I would not run outside again without this unique gadget. Great job Garmin!. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, readability, battery, PC link,. 
Cons:. Poor GPS tracking. 
Summary:. First of all, this is the best of what is out there today (unless you want to lug a 5 lb GPS meant to ride on the dashboard of your car).. Tremendous aid to any runner/biker. I run 5 yrs using a pedometer and one cannot expect any accuracy better than 5%. I've used the 201 for 2+ yrs/3000 miles and it is within 2% MOST of the time. There are instances where it will worse, especially in narrow streets or under tree cover (summer). I agree that it is not tremendously accurate for race day, but my results where a lot better than those reported by another reviewer (a couple of examples: 13.5 miles on a half marathon, and 6.5 miles on a 10K race). It almost ALWAYS errs on the + side. As for features, it works really well. Big display, good backlight, really watertight, training assistant. I wish Garmin would improve the gain on the GPS antenna, although they may be limited here to keep its size reasonable. The new constellation of GPS satellites that the US gov't started launching in late '05 may help get the accuracy to below 1%. The PC software is another cool thing that allows one to track all the runs &#38; bike outings. It'd be nice if it would keep these in separate logs. Also, there are a number of third party programs that will take the Forerunner data and map it on a street or satellite map showing the path you've taken in your workout.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have been using the Forerunner for about 3 months now and LOVE IT! Going from the Timex system which requires a watch and armband unit, the Garmin is much lighter and more practical. Battery life and ease of use are both very high. This may seem like. 
Cons:. None. 

$$;
Pros:. Look at my summary, it says it all. In addition: Virtual Partner, History Log (5000 entries), Build Quailty and and Large Screen.. 
Cons:. Does lose signal. Mine lost signal numerous times on a tree lined trail, but still came out with the correct mileage. No HRM. Improve signal connection and add HRM and this is the perfect running tool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of info. It's nice to know what %grade hills I've been running. Haven't had it in heavy trees yet but, no problem with GPS signal. Comfortable. Rechargeble battery with 16 hour charge.. 
Cons:. The PC log program needs work. It seems to have been written in the mid 90's. Serial port connection.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big display, small and light, useful training aide, tons of information after the run, fun, nothing else like it, good price.. 
Cons:. Needs a decent view of the sky (all GPS does), wish the screen was rotated slightly to make viewing even easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of neat features, extremely accurate distance even under heavy tree cover, simple to use, lightweight and comfortable on wrist.. 
Cons:. My wife thinks it's dorky looking. Pace function can get erratic under trees.. 

$$;
Pros:. Rechargeable with long battery life. Virtual running partner is very handy.. 
Cons:. Takes quite some time to acquire gps signal lock. It has no problem once locked on though.. 
Summary:. I love my Garmin Forerunner because I can go anywhere and run wherever and I will always know how far I've gone and my pace. I can customize the display settings too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has never failed me in altitude and distance. I've never lost a signal... 
Cons:. The pace reading is a moment in time and often varies to what pace I think I'm doing. 
Summary:. I've owned the Forerunner 201 for about 3 months. It has worked well for me. I use in trail running in Sedona, Az and recently used it during the PF Chang's half-marathon in Phoenix, Az. It worked well through out the race and conformed with the official distances.. My only complaint is the pace readout seems to vary greatly for the that moment in time it is measuring. It shows me running a seven minute mile and and I will then glance down and it will show an eight minute mile. I've learned not to depend upon it as having a consistent reading of my pace.. I haven't used it for navigation so I cannot comment on how that works.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lightwieght, big numbers for easy reading on the run. Great for training and just leeping track of your workouts. Download to your computer and analyze your workouts.. 
Cons:. Pace is inaccurate at times, but the averages keep this in check.. 

$$;
Pros:. Loaded with features and easy to read screen.. 
Cons:. Looses signal easily even in clear unobstructed view of the sky.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good GPS tracking. Download route taken to logbook, export route from logbook in XML, plot route taken on a map or high altitude photo.. 
Cons:. Does not also upload of waypoints or route via the PC interface.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has GPS functions for tracking and marking your trail for future use. Helps me monitor my speed plus keep a track of my time and distance. You can set up the electronic buddy to run with you so you can maintain the pace you want. Maintains a history of yo. 
Cons:. The PC software must be downloaded. Although I haven't tried inputing my info into the computer, the serial port transfer has to be seriously slow.. 

$$;
Pros:. This product has everything the normal runner needs. I am happy to have a wearable GPS unit. I have read a lot of reviews that keep saying, "Why doesn't it have a heartrate monitor?" "Why doesn't it have an MP3 player?" "It isn't in color?" Good Lord! The. 
Cons:. The only complaint I have is the serial cable but I can live with it. I do wish that the cable was longer though, but I can get an extension for that.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very accurate, automatic miles splits, great value, bigger than a watch but LIGHT (you won't know you are wearing it, Mark a waypoint and you will find your way to it!. 
Cons:. Not many Cons. It requires a serial port connection to connect to your computer. If you have a laptop, you will likely need to buy a USB/serial adaptor. Wish that it could map routes and save them, but adding this feature would likely price it out of my r. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice big LCD (not color) display for the time display; great for monitoring stats; history useful for tracking progress and performance; great price ($129 US); good battery life in the rechargeable batteries; nice "toy" features like displaying a graphic. 
Cons:. FR unit is bulky but not heavy; Garmin log software just barely adequate; sync'ing sometimes requires several on/off's of the FR for it to work; USB instead of a serial port connector would be nice but not a biggie. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, light, multi-faceted device. Bought it for running - kept it for geo-caching!. 
Cons:. Spotty reception under tree cover. Can lose total distance. (But the timer keeps running.). 

$$;
Pros:. *great pace features and accurate distance...nice to know how far running routes really are *display is easily readable *virtual training partner is nice to help motivate you to reach your target goal *lots of extra information on elevation etc. to dowloa. 
Cons:. *only thing missing is a heart rate monitor...and your tan line from wearing is slightly bigger than a watch *logbook software doesn't give many options for slicing and dicing data, but it is free to download. 

$$;
Pros:. real time feedback on distance, pace and more detail to download later. Virtual partner is ideal for motivation when running alone. 
Cons:. calorie counter is not accurate.. 

$$;
Pros:. Anything you ever instantly wanted to know about your training run (pace/speed,distance,elevatio n,time, calories, % of grade, etc.). 
Cons:. Heart rate monitor? Projected finish time? Weak signal on cloudy day which effected the grade reading.. 

$$;
Pros:. Most basic functions are a snap to use while allowing more exploration of advanced features. PC logging is really neat!. 
Cons:. Can be frustrating to wait for it to pick up the satellites before you start your run.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent GPS accuracy in the States. Generally holds lock on shady trails. Easy to read/use. Comfortable to wear with good, audible alarms.. 
Cons:. Only "Very Good" quality GPS accuracy in Europe. Lap/Distance sometimes inaccurate &#38; messes up pace info. Logbook helpful but needs some work.. 

$$;
Pros:. Relatively small and compact - good for those indivudals who travel on business; Useful when running in a new location; Clear display with good backlighting when needed. 
Cons:. Recently ran a marathon with some tree cover but mostly clear view of the sky. The Forerunner indicated a distance of 27.2 miles at the end of the marathon - a 4% error (error grew linearly throughout the marathon). This limited the usefullness of the pac. 

$$;
Pros:. Compared to the nike triax elite and sunnto t6, it is relatively cheap. I was able to get it on ebay for about $45 less than retail. Gives very accurate distance and pace readings. Easy to use and although appears bulky, when you put it on is actually qu. 
Cons:. The biggest problem with it is that the GPS signals are weak, on cloudy days or areas where there are an abundance of trees, it does not get the signal, even worse is that the timer will stop as well so even if you know the route and distance you are runn. 

$$;
Pros:. Generally, it is a good device when running in near-perfect conditions. If you only run on cement roads or heavily used trails (or just areas with a good view of the sky), it should work fine.. 
Cons:. If you run on trails, the Garmin Forerunner 201 can be highly erroneous. To compensate for those errors, waypoints must be made frequently so the device can determine the length of your run. Unfortunately, there aren't any things you can do for the peri. 

$$;
Pros:. Good steady pace display. Very accurate distance measurement (and altitude measurement with software logbook). Auto-lap feature is very useful.. 
Cons:. Operation in woodland/built up areas can range from OK to useless, depending on satellite positions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good feature set.. 
Cons:. Poor software. Serial interface. Increasingly erratic performance. Loses GPS signal too easily. Recently did the seemingly impossible - recorded longer miles than actual ( apparantly the shortest distance between two points is not a straight line ). 

$$;
Pros:. The watch is great when it is working. Also love the plethora of features.. 
Cons:. Had so much trouble with this watch under what I thought was a clear view of the sky. Ran routes that had some tree cover and buildings and was extremely frustrated to see it not working for long periods of time. I was able to forgive the intial load ti. 

$$;
Pros:. Great idea. Keeps a record of (allegedly) two-years length, with distance, time, and a lot more with the clunky software. The lighted screen is very helpful, too.. 
Cons:. I live in-town, where buildings/trees prevent a reliable GPS signal. Distance for laps is very inaccurate, and its speed seems very inaccurate even on a straight run. When I am running at a steady easy pace on level ground, it swings from a 22-minute pace. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to read. Easy to charge.. 
Cons:. Very poor durability.. 
Summary:. After going through FOUR Forerunners (two of the 100 series and two of the 201) that have broken down for various reasons, I'm done with Garmin. To their credit, they honor their warranties, but since they keep breaking down, that eventually doesn't do much good. Two of the four failed because rain moisture seeped into the units (they are supposed to be waterproof). One had the battery fail completely. For my last unit, the screen just died. Repair fee is $70.00.. I have friends who have had better luck. But I am thoroughly done. I do not recommend this GPS system and will stay far away from Garmin products in the future.. 

$$;
Pros:. It had all the features that I wanted. 
Cons:. The unit only worked one out of three times I used it.. 
Summary:. I was looking for a GPS watch for running and came across this model. I did some research and this looked to be what I needed. It had all the features I wanted and was real easy to work/understand. The reason why I gave it a rating of 2? It worked once out of the three times I used it.. My very first run with it it could not get a signal. There were no leaves on the trees and I live in a very rural area so there weren't any large buildings in the way,it was a fairly cloudless day and it still couldn't get a signal. The second time I used it was the only time it worked. The third and final time I used it I was running on a trail (again no leaves on the trees and no big buildings) and it did not work.. I was frustrated and disappointed in the fact that even on a cloudless day out in the middle of no where it couldn't get a signal.. I do not recomend this product to any one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect for jogging outdoors, specially on the beach. You have total control of your training.. 
Cons:. As I live in Brazil I had to pay almost 50% of a new unit in shipping and customs to have my unit replaced. And as it is broken again I will have the same costs to rapair it. 
Summary:. I am deeply disapointed because I had the bad luck of having two different units with the same malfuntion, (it freezes and can�t perform any of it�s functions). I spent U$ 65,00 in shipping and customs for having my first unit replaced, and now to have this "new one" repaired,I would have to spend another US$ 65,00. After a lot of complaints, they asked me to use they DHL account to send the unit to US without costs, but DHL here in Brazil says that this is not a valid account number for Brazil-US; they would have to open a new account. I found out that there is an Garmin authorized service here in Sao Paulo, but they don�t have the necessary parts nor the autorization from Garmin to fix my forerunner.. I like the forerunner 201 but I don�t think it is fair to pay 50% of the price of a new one to have it repaired..
