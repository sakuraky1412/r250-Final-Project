like i began this summory above , i will end with the same plain and simple fact   spectacular product  .
i had an unlocked 8gb iphone 3g and got myself and my 15 year old son the vibrant using the buy one get one free deal  .
i got tired of the iphones limited capacity , having to use edge , lack of camcorder , other than a 3rd party app , and having to convert avi's to watch videos  .
i upgraded the iphone to 4  .
1 and it made the iphone pretty much useless  .
it is laggy and buggy , take forever to open anything , if it opened it up at all  .
i had to tether it to make mms work and if the phone crashed , which it did a lot , or if i had to reboot it , i had to retether it and it became too much of a pain  .
so my wife is getting a new blackberry and i got to play with the vibrant and ended up getting it  .
now it's about a month later and i'm very glad i did  .
first the screen and video playback is unbelievable rich and saturated  .
16 gbs bullt in is so nice and its upgradable up to 32 gbs with a micro sd card , thats a lot of media  .
i is in the hospital having surgery for a few days and i loaded 5 movies from 1  .
5 gbs to 700mbs and 7 episodes of seinfeld and curb your enthusiasm at about 350 mbs each episode along with about 5 gigs of music  .
i is entertained  .
having 3g is such a luxury now compared to using edge  .
the video recorder takes good video , but i haven't seen it on my big screen yet  .
pictures look nice too  .
i have a few games like asphalt , reckless racing , raging thunder , and it's right on par or even better than the iphones preformance  .
bigger screen too , so the free full version of angry bird looked really cool  .
the processor is plenty fast and the browser is easy to use  .
i kind of like that the phone is so light , although some think it's too plasticky  .
i like that you can put in your shirt pocket and it wo not sag it  .
it does need a good media manager and the battery life is really poor  .
the android market also pales in comparison to the app store , so the apps lack in quality and quantity , but those are really my only complaints so far  .
i just had to get over not having an iphone anymore and i'm glad i did .
got this around the end of aug  .
when i dropped my mytouch 3g (without a case , and without insurance  .
stupid me)  .
would not have been ready for an upgrade for some time , but the mytouch screen is rendered useless , thus the entire phone is useless  .
i loved the mytouch (my first android device) , but compared to the vibrant it seems a little like a toy in retrospect i immediately got the silicon gel cover at the t    mo kiosk (lesson learned the hard way  .
) and i have to say , this alleviates the plasticky feel many (rightly) complain about  .
with this simple gel cover , the phone feels solid , protected , and just the right weight  .
(though not quite as pocket    friendly as i want) there's no denying this beast is a battery drainer  .
i have chargers everywhere now   home , car and work  .
i'm constantly charging , so this is not a particular con for me  .
also , with this blazingly bright screen , it is not really surprising  .
the less your screen is on , the longer your battery will last  .
(btw , the micro    usb port chargers are ubiquitous on the net and , so , very inexpensive  .
android rules  .
what steve jobs calls fragmentation , we call choice  .
i'm still tweaking , discovering ,  enjoying  this device every day , ten weeks later  .
get this phone  .
love the pone  .
incredible phone to compete at the forefront with the big boys in this industry  .
samsung could easily make a metal backing and improve battery performance for those who already own the device  .
i encourage them to do so  .
i think this is the best phone on the market  .
love the android touchwiz os , wifi is super fast and this phone has excellent call quality  .
the quality is so good that sometimes when i am talking to someone i think they hang up when they are not speaking because it is so clear  .
top notch phone  .
screen   my roomate has the iphone 4 to be honest , i don't see the plus to the retina display  .
i cannot see pixels on either , this phone displays black better than the iphone , and just has a glossier look  .
this one screams hd , i watched avatar the other night on it , the quality looks better than the $2000 tv we have at home  .
it's like having an hd tv in your pocket , with access to youtube and the rest of the web  .
how does that not sound awesome  .
speed   hummingbird processor is flat out the best  .
super responsive  .
runs slightly warm with my case , but no real complaints  .
especially after rooting the phone (which is very easy and foolproof , guides at xda) and installing a custom rom (bionix is my personal fav) , overclocking and undervolting is possible , the phone is super    responsive , near impossible to bog down by opening a ton of stuff    so much i cannot even list is all  .
my little brother loved how easy it is to hack a ps3 with a rooted android phone  .
another plus to rooting  .
great community support  .
amazing new capabilities for the phone  .
faster upgrades than any phone company    durability   i drop this phone almost every morning from my bedside  .
that's about a 6 ft drop (dorm rooms)  .
i still don't even have a nick on the screen  .
not that i intend to push the envelope testing it , but the screen seems super    durable  .
my college is full of iphone users (50% about of students have)  .
about 30% of those iphones have cracked screens  .
i've seen 0 cracked galaxy s screens so far  .
imo , the durability is more than worth the slightly plastic    y feel (which is certainly present)  .
i don't even use a screen protector  .
5 months and countless drops later , still looks new  .
my roomate's iphone , on the other hand , has a few nicks and dents in the metal band    being on android equates to super    customizability (smartphone is expensive , i like to be able to customize  .
) , and amazing speed , not to mention great compatibility (flash , anyone  .
) google maps/navigation is amazing , though the gps will eat your battery  .
android's market also has countless apps  .
it's growing super    quick too  .
a good deal are free , i've rarely not been able to find what i want    it's everything you could want in a phone , compact  .
long gone are those days when i would carry around a cell , ipod , camera , and still want my laptop around to do what those could not , i can do pretty much everything from my phone now  .
you can even install software on both so you can access your computer from your phone  .
smartphones are becoming everything    devices  .
this is the best t    mobile has to offer , and believe me , they don't need to offer any better until the galaxy 2 comes out (ffc , 2ghz processor , same amazing screen and probably a lot more  .
cannot wait  .
until then , i am a very happy t    mobile customer with the plethora of things this phone can do  .
i cannot speak for at t , verizon or sprint customers concerning best smartphones , but if you are on one of those carriers and looking to get a smartphone , check out their galaxy s equivalent at the store  .
it's worth looking , at the least    yes , there is no slide out keyboard , front facing camera (ffc) , or led flash  .
however , the camera still takes amazingly high quality pics , and a ffc is easily installable (see xda , they are about $30 and involve a little bit of paint scratching and soldering  .
doing this later in the year  .
as to the keyboard , the onscreens aren't as bad as some people say  .
i actually think swype is better than a slide    out , i text faster and with fewer errors using swype than many friends with traditional slide    outs    a lot of people also complain about the battery life  .
if you leave on gps and bluetooth all day , your battery will flop  .
turn those off if you aren't suing them  .
also , try to either have wifi on/3g off , or wifi off/3g on depending on your location (wifi is faster , and i'm on a college campus  .
thus , i rarely use 3g)  .
having one on and not the other will drastically improve battery  .
also , leaving things like aim on will drain  .
do not use a task killer , that will also drain  .
forwarding everything to gmail and only using that will also help  .
finally , a custom rom works wonders too , i normally have zero trouble going from 9am    12am off one charge , and i spend a good deal of the day messing with my phone playing youtube vids , texting , calling , browsing the web , reading news/kindle checking facebook/twitter/email , listening to pandora , etc etc  .
if you still have issues , consider a 2nd battery to carry around in your pocket and just switch em out  .
might be doing that too , for days i forget to charge/want to use my phone even more all in all , amazing work , on both samsung and xda's devs  .
happily enjoying my phone as i eagerly await the samsung galaxy 2 , which is supposed to be released next year hopefully around my birthday  .
great phone , great dvice if you like multimedia away from home  .
battery life can be problematic .
this is the best phone i have ever used after having the , samsung t219 , razr , sidekick 3 , sidekick lx , sidekick 2008 , rockr , g1 , mytouch , nexus one , mytouch slide , and finally vibrant 3  .
this is a great phone  .
i lost my love for my iphone after the 4  .
0 update (apples windows me)  .
it became slow and almost unusable  .
i also got kind of sick of apples strangle hold over the apps you could install    i love linux and this os is a great variant  .
the video on this phone is amazing as is the camera (the iphone 4 is marginally better but not worth the downside)  .
i have no issues with the battery life on mine  .
the weak spot is t    mobiles coverage  .
in most cases it is fine but in the house it is kind of bad  .
overall this is one of the best phones i have owned    and i have had all the iphones .
awesome phone  .
i use it for almost everything i need to do  .
has nearly replaced my home pc for simple tasks  .
i would highly recommend this phone  .
it has been very reliable  .
hasn't locked up on me yet  .
i've had it for over a month now , and i haven't had a phone yet that i have not had to reset at least once doing simple tasks  .
this phone can be rooted (very easy to unlock) so anything is possible , this phone is not binded like iphone  .
this phone comes with 16gb standard and you can also add 32gb sd card later if you need more space  .
also people complaining about battery life can go into the phone menu and turn off gps and auto    sync while you're not using it since you do not use them all the time so no point in leaving that on all the time , it will give you at least 30+ hours of battery usage  .
this phone is so fast  .
this phone can handle ps1 emulator easily since it has the best graphic processor among them all , i had evo 4g and that phone is also outstanding but the speed in no way comes close to this phone  .
buy this phone if you do not want to waste time waiting for applications to open .
in a very small span of time this phone has taken over my life  .
it's amazing  .

not much people are talking about this whole new way to type and i just want to add that it is fast and fun this is my first time using it and its just to easy and to fun again just get the phone there is nothing to not like took me about 2 minuet to type this up well not type even tho you can use it as just a normal key bored you wo not for due to the fun level and speed .
i upgraded from a motorola cliq and this blows it out of the water  .
the cliq is garbage , and the vibrant is 1000 times better  .
i haven't experienced any of the problems that some of the other reviewers experienced  .
it synced up to outlook easily  .
i have not experienced any bugs , nor have i dropped any calls , except from my wife's phone (she has a cliq) .
i is on the fence rather to switch to att for the i phone or saty with t    mobile  .
i'm glad i stayed  .
i have never owned a i phone but i'm sure this phone does everything the i phone would have plus i have a better plan with t    mobile  .
i'm use to using my i pod and the i phone would have been easy to learn but putting things on the vibrant is just as easy just plug and play  .
if you're on the fence stay with t    mobile do not think the grass is greener on the other side .
buy this phone  .
my co    workers who have the new i    phone 4 wo not give my phone back  .
this phone is the best android phone i have seen  .
i like the droid2 but it seems that motorola has blackballed t    mobile  .
where as the samsung galaxy s seems to be on every phone company  .
this phone is awesome , i recommend it to everyone who needs a phone that has mastered the art of the phone call , the internet , and voice mail  .
visual voice mail is the app that will define how voice mail is handled on a phone  .
please get this phone  .
i got the vibrant through t    mobile as my 22 month upgrade  .
after tax is came to about $264 , and i will be getting $50 back on a pre    paid visa card in 6    8 weeks  .
this phone is tremendous  .
it's the first smartphone i've had that makes me truly feel like it revolutionizes phones  .
the screen is unmatched , i mean absolutely unmatched  .
even the iphone 4 does not compare when comparing side by side  .
not to mention this phone has surround sound , which creates a big bang out of it's tiny little speaker  .
the sound and picture on this phone are amazing  .
avatatr , which is pre    loaded on the phone , looks a lot better on the phone than it does on blu    ray or in theaters  .
probably do to the smaller screen , not to take away fromt he super amoled screen from the speed , the quality of the screen sound , the camera , the video recorder , the apps , the battery life , the swype texting (which is absolutely wonderful , i've never texted so fast in my life) , the menu design , the web browser with multi    touch , the call quality , the threaded texting style , to the built in services and the sheer design of the phone every little feature on this phone amazes me  .
i left tons of great things out in this review , but trust me when i say that this phone will disappoint none in comparison to the iphone 4 and the evo 4g , i'd say the phone takes the prize when comparing to the iphone 4 , but breaks about even with the evo 4g  .
android is improving by day and it's already a top    notch interface get this phone  .
if you are tied to t    mobile there should be no thinking about it  .
this phone is on a whole new level than say the mytouch 3g slide or the cliq xt  .
buy the vibrant and you will immediately know you made the right choice  .
overall the best phone on the market by any carrier  .
the iphone can take a hike with it's proprietary garbage  .
this phone comes pre    loaded with great software  .
avatar , mobitv , and the soon to be live meida hub the newest android phone is also the best  .
no rooting necessary as this beast carries a 1ghz hummingbird processor capable of handling anything that you throw at it , including the bloat ware , and does it with out so much as a hiccup it is durable and built to withstand every day use  .
durability tests have proven that a screen protector is not really necessary  .
the gorilla glass holds up against anything  .
from my personal use i have been very careful but no matter what , fingerprints happen  .
one wipe and it is like it is just out of the box  .
people complain that it feels cheap and my response to that is that it held up perfectly from drops of 90cm  .
just because it is thin and doesn't feel strong doesn't mean that it is not i have been enjoying kindle  .
the screen is so big and bright that reading books is a breeze  .
seriously , i am carrying around about 15 books in my pocket everywhere i go  .
the screen , yes , a amoled screen which makes people druel when they see avatar playing overall the best phone i have owned to date  .
running 2  .
1 update 1 with rumors of 2  .
2 being released on september  .
and yes , it does have gps issues but the 2  .
2 is supposed to take care of it  .
if they don't send out 2  .
2 in september , they are at least promising a gps fix in september i would recommend this phone to anyone in a heartbeat  .
it really just does not get any better than this .
i am coming from using a mytouch and also a blackberry bold 9700 and i would like to say this product stuns me  .
it is by far the best t    mobile phone i have ever had  .
it is a must have phone for t    mobile hardcore technology junkies  .
the battery lasts more than per day depending on use  .
on average my battery meter is 3/4 full at the end of the day with regular usage  .
the screen is beautiful and the 1ghz processor has more than enough power to keep the phone running smoothly  .
the only thing is that the phone is sluggish from time to time  .
however , i have recently rooted it and moded it with the lagfix and it has virtually no lag  .
i believe when samsung releases the android 2  .
2 update the lag problem will be gone  .
the lagfix hacked vibrant literally destroys the nexus one 2  .
2 and droid x on the quadrant cpu test .
note   i have used all versions of iphone and and android builds and have advanced tech knowledge and experience speed (2 core processor  .
are you effing kidding me  .
screen (blacker than black , brighter than bright) yes its the title of my next novella  .
retina what  .
touch wiz overlay (usually i hate these with a passion  .
) a joy  .
dimensions    excellent balance of weight and size  .
design    sleek gorgeous and simple , my fav of all the carriers iterations  .
a note on battery life when i first got this i went crazy with the usage ( learning + enamored) , so the battery is terrible  .
lots o' pandora and podcasts  .
in new users enthusisam we really dont realize how much we tax the new toys and then believe the battery sucks  .
even though is no where close to average usage  .
when considering the gpu (graphics processing unit) and 2 core processor the life i nothing short of a miracle  .
on normal usage it should last most of the day if not all (once the enthusiasm dies off)  .
be aware of how much punishment you are throwing at this bad boy and the reality is impressive get a car charger online for cheap  .
plug it in when you can and it may not even dent it if you are on the fence  .
get it  .
get it  .
get it  .
95% chance you will be in love  .
worst case , return it  )  .

on aug 19 , 2010  .
i have many friends who switched to at t for the iphone however , i waited and waited as a loyal t    mobile customer all these years  .
all i can say , the samsung vibrant is definitely worth the wait  .
i bought this phone as a replacement to the motorola cliq (brick)  .
since i am a loyal tmobile user , i had a limitted selection of replacement choices but this phone is amazing  .
when i first held the phone i is surprised by it's light weight  .
then i turned it on and looked at the screen  .
i is imediately awed by the dislplay  .
the images are so bright and crisp  .
the included movie , avatar , looks better on the phone than it did in 3d in the theater if you are an android user already you will notice that the app screen is not the traditional android screen  .
samsung has included touchwiz 3  .
0 , its own skin or whatever it is called that opperates on top of the android os  .
at first i found it weird , but it is actually quite functional call quality is good and it works well with my gm bluetooth hands    free calling  .
the contacts list can be synced with facebook so that images are displayed with the names i use several web browsers , but the android browser seems to work the best  .
it is superfast especially with wi    fi gps is accurate the music playback is great and sounds awesome with the included earbuds  .
playback over my stereo system sounds great too overall this phone is awesome  .
i never expected that samsung would compete like this in the smartphone market .
i wont go far my wife (iphone 4 user) wants to steal my samsung galaxy s vibrant (bell canada) phone no mayor issues with this phone , behaves like a bmw or ferrari or whatever (some apple fanboys may say iphone 4 behaves like a lamborghini)  .
surpasses iphone 4 in speed , screen brightness , sound quality , screen size , battery is replaceable  .
fm radio tunner , can add more memory , equal to iphone 4 in photo and video quality , battery life , front facing camera (my carrier , bell canada , offers it) android os openness and no antenna issues .
its a solid phone  .
and for those who don't need the physical keyboard , and prefer the thinness , this phone is perfect  .
the screen really is magnificent  .
i've put it next to the droid x and you really don't miss the  .
3 inches , but you do notice the difference in display i like the fact that samsung does give you a lot of options  .
there are 3 different keyboards to choose from so if u don't like swype or even the samsung keyboard , you can change it  .
you can use samsung's widgets or the default android widgets 16gb internal memory is great  .
it's enough for all of my music so i could sell ipod  .
almost paid for the phone  .
the music player is nice and the 3  .
5mm jack is a nice thing to have  .
(be sure to push the jack all the way in  .
you do have to push hard)  .
all in all , its an excellent phone  .
the widgets , email , messaging , and ease of use are fantastic , and the display makes it a practical all in one media device  .
keep your eye on the battery , and do not overuse the features or you will need a midday charge  .
it really is a beautiful phone though , and i would recommend it to anyone .
purchased the t    mobile slide 6 weeks ago and liked the physical keyboard , however , it is too heavy and the screen is small  .
i have owned several t    mo phones and can say truthfully , the vibrant blows all of them out of the water  .
the day of purchase , i lunched w/ co    worker who owns the iphone 3g and we compared  .
she is sold on the vibrant and purchased it that evening  .
the only real con that could make it a deal breaker is the battery life , however , a car charger makes it a non    issue  .
i absolutely love this phone updated  .
on aug 21 , 2010  .
great android phone , converted me from apple  .
highly recommend this amazing smart phone  .
amazing phone that i wouldn't trade for anything  .
including the iphone 4  .
tmobile has always had excellent service and i is almost sad to give it up in order to get the htc incredible from verizon  .
imagine my surprise and delight when i saw the vibrant had come out  .
tried it out and have been extremely satisfied with it so far  .
other than the battery life , which can be improved , i haven't had any problems with this  .
the calendar feature is especially wonderful  .
good syncability  .
have not tried to music player on this though , so hopefully it matches up as well with the rest of this amazing phone .
this is indeed an awesome smart phone which i'm very happy with  .
i had this phone for exactly a month now and i'm loving it more and more  .
there are so many options on this phone it gets to be mind    boggling at times  .
i is with at t for 5 years and this is a great switch for me to t    mobile the vibrant is light weight , which i absolutely love because i don't want to carry a steel plate in my pocket  .
battery last me about 1  .
5 days [medium usage] , but that's expected for a 3g smart phone  .
my gps works about 90% of times but it depends on the particular apps that i'm using  .
i only wish that samsung has more widgets that one can download  .
personally , i do not care about ffc  .
the led light in the front [not being on all the time] is a bit frustrating in the beginning but i got used to it  .
no biggie  .
all and all , it's a fantastic piece of technology and i find myself playing with it all  .
the  .
time  .
honestly i am very happy with this phone  .
if you have great t    mobile service in your area then its great , if not then you might want to go with another provider  .
because t    mobile is not as famous in its data services , the network is really fast and works very well  .
also its the cheapest data plan you are going to get for unlimited data  .
the phone itself is beautiful and rivals the iphone in every way , including the android 2  .
1 os and samsung's touch wiz 3  .
0 interface (which takes many cues from the iphones menu system while adding personality to the phone which you cant get anywhere other than android)  .
if you are looking for a great smartphone with tons to offer and unlimited expandibility and growth , this is your phone .
good phone  .
i went into t    mobile to pay my bill and suggested i may be looking for an upgrade the clerk then showed me a working vibrant and it blew me away  .
everything about it is perfect for my job in internet sales , and my personal life  .
what else can i say , it's my next phone in about 4 months when i can get it for free .
cannot wait  .

now with the vibrant i can do all that and more  .
the web browsing is amazing  .
literary the only thing i use my pc for is playing video games (sc2 tf2 , ftw  .
the camera is better than i thought it would be at 5mp , and the video quality of the 720p is crazy good not a single regret buying this phone .

on sep 10 , 2010  .
i came from a cliq and a blackberry 8330 and neither phone cannot touch this phone  .
i have not put this phone down since i purchased it .
explanation of goodies  .
gorgeous amoled screen ( sucks 30% less power than retina display and more vibrant) though it has 3 % less clarity than retina display which cannot be noticied because of the bigger screen than iphone 4  .
this because iphone is 920 p something and samsung vibrant is 820p something  .
but colors and brightness samsung vibrant lives to its name 2  .
1 channel surrond sound , to hear 5  .
1 surround music is amazing and i have ordered an hdmi cable so that i can get 5  .
1 surrond through hdmi to my home theatre  .
swype technology is amazing    makes a normal person a message addict  .
swype technology is the fastest and most innovative messaging technology in a mobile  .
its fun and quick you feel swyping to all your contacts   )  .
android os    extremely customizable    you can have themes , customize widgets icons short cuts several kinds of folders    like a folder of type recent documents will automatically contain all your recent documents (just like it does in a computer) or a folder of type facebook contacts will contain all facebook contacts , you can have shortcut to directly dial a person , you can place a widget to daily brief you from your important sites of the day  .
the home screens are like a desktop and you are the master of it    i am running two kinds of themes the original samsung touch wiz and another called launch pro , its like running a pc with linux and mac  .
customization posibilities is infinite  .
you will be amazed by what android does  .
compared to iphone os is just a bunch of icons and thats it  .
they made possible to group icons now and the cutomization ends there 5  .
camera options like    mode of shot ,    you can have single shot panorama etc , adjust saturation , iso etc , more than any other camera in a mobile  .
gps   gps works fine for me (but i had to did a simple fix and it is working fine , to fix the gps issue visit url     .

explanation of the bad  .
position of the power/lock button    it is at a wierd place , but once you get used to it not a big issues  .
position of the usb charging port    it is at the top instead of the bottom , which would have made docking good  .
samsung has a dock so this is not an issues  .
no camera flash    i really dont understand why they did not include falsh , not a big deal because mobile flashes are not that great anyways  .
gps is slow out of the box , but there is a fix online  .

summary    i bought this phone with a little anxiety because i did not get to feel or see it out of the box before buying  .
but after two days i am simply amazed at what this phone can do , especially after using the iphone software  .
the customization possibilities are infinite and if you are the kind of person who likes customization and wants the phone to be you , look no further  .
the display is great camera is great sound is great , gps works fine  .
all in all simpy a great phone some further thoughts     .
android phones in the past where not able to compete with iphone  .
now the android phones do give the iphone a run for its money i saw lots of reviews of the battery life , either people like the phone and are addictive and see the battery go down  .
i am getting a days worth of battery life with all that i do and i think it is fair  .
i saw lots of email synching issues and i am not sure about this  .
i am a gmail person so no problem for me  .
another issue is that the 4 android buttons on the bottom are not very responsive  .
i had it covered with a screen protectioncover  .
these are heat sensitive buttons and not part of the touch screen , so you need to remove the cover from the buttons and now they wrok for me updated  .

this is the best phone ive ever used  .

my iphone 3gs died from salt water in our last vacation  .
surprising how quickly it corroded and died  .
could not upgrade until february , and given the iphone 4 antenna issues and disappointing initial cover up , decided to look elsewhere  .
is quite hesitant to change to t    mobile after having had a good experience with at t  .
so far i am happy that i did  .
the vibrant exceeded my expectations and my experience with it thus far has been much better than with the iphone i had invested to some degree in apple apps and music , and felt i is going to throw some money out the window by changing  .
regarding the itunes library , all you need is salling media sync http  //www  .
salling  .
com/mediasync/mac/ and install it in your mac  .
it's free unless you want the faster version  .
once the client is running , the tricky part is figuring out that you need to go to the phone settings    applications    development    and check usb debugging connect the usb cable to the phone and pull down the upper gray status bar and click usb connected , then click mount  .
then go to the salling program and follow the instructions  .
note that two drives will be mounted  .
you want to install your info in the larger drive which corresponds to the external card and not the internal memory you'll be pleasantly surprised that the free applications are much better quality and with better functionality than what we are used to in the app store  .
in terms of useful applications i ended up having more than what i previously had and free  .
if you want a variety of games , that is where the iphone is ahead for the time being  .
otherwise , i can do as much as i is doing with the iphone and more transferring the contacts from the mac is easier than i thought  .
just highlight all and export them as a group vcard from the file menu in the address book in your mac  .
log to your gmail account in the internet , and import the vcards  .
next time the phone syncs with gmail your contacts will be imported the phone is lightweight making the iphone feel like a brick  .
the display is beautiful and the wallpaper feature is impressive  .
as far as the headphones go , make sure you push them all the way in (there is some resistance at first)  .
you can use your iphone headphones with the buttons which personally sound better than the included ones tmobile has a better download speed than the 4g sprint according to many  .
at the central west end in st  .
louis i have had from 1200 to 3200 kbits/second which is decent considering i got form 3000 to 5800 kbits/second with the wifi  .
so far no issues with dropped calls or poor signal i paid the phone in full which in the long run is cheaper and i don't have to be locked in for a contract  .
the staff at tmobile although they try to be helpful , are not prepared to handle an iphone user converting to the samsung vibrant , or know what an iphone user needs to know to feel comfortable with the transition  .
one tmobile salesperson actually owned an iphone which blew my mind for the first time i feel a smart phone has reached a level that i feel very happy guess what , no more blue squares where flash is supposed to play  .
many of the hardware complaints people have had for the iphone like lack external memory , exchangeable battery , and so    so external speakers are not issues for the vibrant  .
i can even imagine they will start selling custom shells for the phone as these are easily removable and they even include an extra one the avatar movie is a great addition unless you depend on an essential app only available for the iphone , do not be afraid to try something new  .
you'll be happy you did .
after 7 years of blackberry use , which included one month of using an iphone , i made the switch to the android os  .
i could not be happier  .
this device is so much more than what blackberry can offer and trumps the iphone , which has the worst sound quality of any device i have ever used the samsung vibrant is just a beautiful and cool device    i highly recommend it .
don't believe everything you read in the reviews  .
i have seen side by side pics of the iphone , samsung vibrant , droid etc this screens smokes them all  .
everything about this phone is amazing  .
while it does have some lag  .
it is minor , and expected when you have at least 200 contacts  .
or 500 feeds  .
i love the buddies app  .
you can add a lot more than five or ten  .
unlike the limited mytouch  .
the phone feels solid  .
typing on it just reaffirms that i had to hold this phone about an inch from my face ,  .
before i saw any pixels ; it almost messed up my eyesight  .
maybe thats what they mean about retina burns lol  .
the camera doesn't need a flash  .
yes that's right  .
it does not need one  .
it took better pics at night than my mytouch slide does when i use the flash  .
i returned that phone btw i have had this phone for one and a half days the battery is great  .
everything about it is great  .
the chrome border is real metal btw this phone is the truest iphone killer  .
this phone is as awesome as it is beautiful to look at  .
so light you forget it's in your pocket , yet , so powerful and fast that it leaves the competition wanting  .
do not listen to me or anyone else , just go down your local wireless store and try it out but remember to try the iphone , droid x and evo first and then go see the vibrant (it's always good to leave the best for last)  .
in regards to the people complaining about it being not compatible with a mac , well your wrong , i have a mac and it works great (turn on the usb debugging on the phone) , now about it not having a camera flash , well , the night mode setting actually works way better then any camera flash in my opinion just test it yourself and see  .
this phone is worth every penny and then some .
love it highly reccomend it to others  .
always remember , if you think the iphone is better you have to be on at t to get it , this takes away anything an iphone might give you updated  .
on oct 12 , 2010  .
cnet this phone is tested and its the fastest android phone out , why you give it only a 8  .
0 like the my touch slide or why you rate the iphone 4 higher is beyond me , it has no camera flash but this is a phone , everything extra is a bonus and we should not complain about flash missing for the camera , are you going to start complaining about diamonds missing in the future , common  .
the battery is good if you dont use 30 app at the same time , any phone that uses 30 app will drain the battery quick , this is a excellent phone , great call quality plus more (camera , email , android , mp3 player etc)  .
before i bought this phone , i had a simple , no data , no touch phone  .
all my friends have iphones , so i use them or my ipod touch on wifi when i need connectivity  .
i'm extremely picky with spending money , so if i'm going to spend the money on something like a data phone , then it better do exactly what i want it to  .
even though i think iphones are overrated , i'm very fond of their ease of use and overall wholesomeness  .
in addition , i have tested some android phones before but they all felt so incomplete  .
i'm not sure what the right word is , but all the android phones i have previously tried have felt inferior to the wholesome design and usability of the iphone  .
they just didn't wow me now comes the samsung galaxy s vibrant  .
i spent a week doing research and talking to people , including my unbiased friend who works as a third party technician doing service for both t    mobile and at t  .
the end result   i decided to try the sgs from the time i walked into the t    mobile store and picked up the floor model , i have been wowed  .
the ultra amoled display is gorgeous  .
some of you may be aware that samsung manufactures various parts for many other companies , including apple  .
in fact , apple wanted to purchase the sgs display for the new iphone 4 , but samsung turned them down and you won't just get this awesome display , because on the vibrant you are also getting avatar as a wonderful way to show it off to all your friends  .
) to put the awesomeness of an oled (organic light emitting diode) display in perspective for you , sony released the first ever oled television recently , and even though it is only 11 , it costs $2500 dollars  .
with this phone , you are getting not just oled , but ultra amoled (advanced matrix oled) on a 4 display for only $199 with a contract  .
i cannot stress this enough  .
not to mention , on all apple products i have had problems playing videos that are in various formats that i've downloaded from the internet  .
but the sgs will display any video format just fine  .
and you don't even need special software or apps to do it  .
if you have lots of videos on your computer , then just add any file to your phone via microusb , bluetooth , or even the wireless server connectivity app that's already included , and then you can play any file right on your device in hd quality ok enough about the screen , but i just love it , and you will too as for the gps , it works better than my mom's garmin in her car , with the added benefit of adding apps that can do just about anything  .
it comes pre    installed with something called telenav gps , but that's just a trial for something you have to pay for  .
don't bother with that since the google maps app that it also comes with can already do turn by turn navigation  .
i can literally press on the google voice search button on my home screen and say navigate to starbucks and it will proceed to navigate me to the nearest starbucks  .
very easy  .
as for the other gps apps , i added one that will track and record my position , speed , elevation , etc , to google my maps  .
sure , using gps all the time drains the battery faster , but you still have plenty of battery time  .
for example , yesterday i went on a boat trip to an island and i wanted to see exactly where we were headed , so i turned on my tracks , and recorded my position for 6 hours  .
all while i used facebook , and took pictures and hd video  .
the battery made it through the whole thing  .
another cool gps app is called layar , which puts a filter on reality so when you look around , you can see new things  .
for example , the website allmenus  .
com made a layar filter where you can look around and see restaurants in real space around you , and you can just click on them to see their menus  .
it's just like x    ray vision  .
lol  .
if you do not like the real space look , you can switch to map view  .
other filters include wikipedia articles , and youtube videos that are from around you another worry of many is that web browsing will lack compared to the smooth and intuitive design of the iphone  .
well worry no more because it's better  .
you can use multi    touch for zooming or just double tap  .
and some people had problems with getting the text to reformat to the screen when zooming but that's because they're doing it wrong  .
if you simply multi    touch zoom and then double tap , the text will automatically reformat to fit your screen  .
and there's no prob displaying flash or other media  .
plus the pages load so much faster than on the iphone  .
for music , you can buy any song from the amazon music store or get one of those apps that let you download for free  .
or you can use a radio app like pandora or slacker , which will even let you cache the stations to listen when you have no connection all in all , i am so happy with my sgs and it definitely beats the iphone  .
and with unlimited data from t    mobile and unbeatable customer service , you cannot go wrong  .
(and if you have the free google voice like me , then you can have unlimited minutes and texting too  .

i cannot even tell you how close i is to switching to at t for an iphone 4    even went to the at t store to check out pricing plans with my company discount  .
i called t    mobile and made mention of my intention to jump ship (i have 3 lines and 2 are not in contracts    wanted to know the term fee for the 3rd line etc) and they transferred me to the customer loyalty dept here i is offered an amazing deal on the samsung vibrant    only catch    i had to wait 2 weeks for it's release and order over the phonve via the loyalty dept  .
i had just returned my hunk of junk htc hd2 phone and is relying on my 3 year old blackberry curve which is anything but functional  .
long story short    i've had tmobile and been a very happy customer for several years , i appreciate the customer service i receive every time i call in or have any issue and i especially appreciate the deal they gave me on 2 of my lines for sticking with them just got my vibrant yesterday and it's simply amazing    i think i'm in love  .
it's so fast and so simple to use , almost comes natural  .
i couldn't possible rate this phone any higher and i could not give it more of a recommendation    especially for those frustrated tmobile customers who are considering switching to at t for an iphone like i was  .
try it out    you have literally nothing to lose and everything to gain  .
you'll love tmobile again  .
i have had the phone a couple of days now and i love it  .
i switched over from the garminfone to this  .
it is a very user friendly  .
the screen resolution is amazing for a phone  .
i'm happy t    mobile finaly decided to get some better android phones out on the market  .
this is by far the best one they have to offer in my opinion .
t mobile has finally brought a superior phone to their customers  .
this phone kills all the other phones out right now  .
if you have been wondering what phone to get go out and buy this one you wo not be disappointed .
great phone , been wanting an iphone forever  .
my contract just ended with t    mobile , and when this is released , nothing but problems with the iphone4 , i is ready to sign up  .
love the phone and the service from t    mobile  .
again the only complaint is wish it felt a little more solid  .
you cannot fault a phone for being light , but you will understand when you pick it up  .
already ordered a screen protector , and going to get a gel protector for phone  .
worth a look and purchase imho if you are looking for a new smartphone  .
also you can laugh at your friends when they drop calls on there iphone .
i is going to get iphone 4g  .
i now am so glad i got the vibrant instead  .
so much ways to be creative and play around  .
thanks to tmobile having this version  .
so happy  .
better than any others , 5 stars    no doubt  .
great job t    mobile  .
picked this phone up as soon as tmobile opened release day  .
i love it , big upgrade from my trusty g1  .
the store i picked it up from is across from a verizon store and they had a huge line , i walked right in and picked mine up  .
i is glad tmobile and samsung aren't advertising like crazy as motorola is for the droid x , saved me some time in line  .
i do not think they'll need the ads these phones will sell themselves by word of mouth  .
i'm very intrested in seeing the battery test i've been playing with mine (e    mail , movies , sims 3 , and showing it off to everyone and only have to charge it a night .
i rushed out and bought this the day it came out  .
as a long    suffering t    mobile customer , i is so glad we finally got the option of having a truly top    of    the    line smartphone (with apologies to my cliq , which served me pretty well)  .
the display is brilliant , the phone is extremely responsive  .
one area of this review that i completely disagree with is the rather cavalier dismissal of the vibrant's camera and video capabilities  .
the 5 megapixel camera is simply stunning  .
i don't know where they tested the camera out , but it totally impressed me , especially considering the included editing options  .
the 720p video capture is especially useful for me  .
and by the way , a flash is definitely not needed on this thing  .
the camera is so great in varying light levels (so far , i've tested it in my office which is bright with lots of sunlight , and two bars which were fairly low    lit ; all sets of pics came out sharp and clear)  .
i probably do not need to say anything more about android 2  .
1 ; if you already love android , there's more of it to love here  .
if you're on the fence between ios and android , then 2  .
1 may push you over to the droid side  .
the battery life is actually pretty amazing considering the sheer number of features that this phone has  .
i've only had to charge it once since buying it thursday the two (possibly three) cons i had were somewhat minor  .
i do miss having the ringer off    switch that my cliq had (that thing is awfully convenient)  .
and yes , the phone feels extremely light to me (at least compared to the cliq , which could probably go through a plate    glass window) , but that's easily countered by getting a gel case , which you should be getting for a phone like this anyway  .
the potential third con is that i did notice the signal strength is misrepresented (lost 2    3 bars) a few times when i would hold the phone (not tightly , and before i bought the gel case)  .
lest you think i have the iphone    mania , let me say that the vibrant has not dropped a call for me yet , not even when i went into the elevator of my apartment building , something i cannot say about any other phone i've had  .
so , unlike apple's flimsy excuse for the iphone's woes , this truly does appear to be a software issue which can be remedied with a quick update in the future samsung really knocked it out of the park with this one  .
the vibrant is great , and i would recommend it to anybody .
ever since the iphone came out , my friends kept urging me to buy one  .
i opposed it because the iphone never had a good camera  .
but now with the high quality camera and recording capabilities of the iphone 4 , i thought it is perfect  .
thankfully , t    mobile came out with the vibrant  .
it has everything i want in a phone  .
the only thing missing is a better camera with flash  .
but that's okay as long as the current camera is decent  .
had the vibrant not come out i is really thinking about finally leaving t    mobile  .
this phone is the phone to beat i do not see why people have to compare it with the new iphone if thats the case then i guess we will have to try to make it loose signal when you hold it a certain way come on people get over it this phone is the phone to beat period  .
i love this phone there is not anything i need to say about it that has not already been said but , the phone does show zero bars often even though i have no problems holding calls , making calls , or surfing the internet so hopefully samsung will push an update out to us so we can get this minor problem squared away .
samsung makes excellent products , but this phone paired with android is a technological beast  .
this amazing device put all other phones behind history  .
great speed and quality of the phone cannot say enoght for the phone  .
it is true smart phone  .
also upgrade to 2  .
2 android sooner .
this phone is great  .
in no way does it look or feel like the iphone  .
its more than just a bunch of icons , and can be customized the way you want it to be  .
i hear people complaining about it no having a front facing camera , but most wo not even use that feature  .
anyway , go get this phone its on the fastest network , and its the best one of them all  .
puts other phones like the over rated iphone , and evo to rest in a lot of areas .
this is a great phone , and definitely one to buy  .
iphone 4's beware  .
this is a great phone , although i can say it is a bit like the iphone , it has features of both android and iphone that make it great .
some pitfalls to keep in mind , the gps is a little suspect on the phone  .
may not be the best or as reliable as other phones  .
in addition , touchwiz may take some time to get accustomed to  .
the good news is android is your friend , and you can always replace touchwiz if you do not like it  .
i currently use launcherpro  .
one last tidbit , you may have heard about lag on the vibrant  .
this is a problem me , so i had to use ryan  .
s one click lag fix to solve the problem  .
ryan is awesome , because of him , i can continue saying , it  .
s a galaxy s world and this phone is vibrant  .
vibrant in comparison to t    mo  .
s current phone lineups  .
well the g2 came out , this may be the only phone i would change my vibrant 2  .
keyboard is great , screen is okay , but not as nice as vibrant  .
what makes vibrant better  .
1) better screen 2) more internal storage 16 gigs  .
some will say g2 is hspa+  .
yes this is accurate , but on blogs and so forth people r only averaging 3    6 mps in hspa+ areas on average  .
you can get these same speeds on your vibrant as well  .
vibrant in comparison to mytouch4g  .
1) better screen 2) more internal storage 3) better design  .
in my opinion mytouch4g looks for kids , the design on vibrant is better  .
i do not understand y people think vibrant is plasticky when mytouch4g feels the same way  .
however , if you want the ability to video chat , and have flash , mytouch4g is your phone hope this helps those on the fence .
the amoled screen shows amazing pictures and video  .
the hd camcorders clarity is truly amazing to me  .
have not watched the avatar just yet  .
the apps are plentiful  .
my fave being the barcode scanners  .
i have quite a bit on this phone and the battery life works fairly well  .
again , i have a lot on here i downloaded a bunch of songs and now use this as my mp3 for the gym  .
i no longer take my phone and mp3 with me  .
the pull down screen i really like because it gives me everything in one place from missed calls to vm and text msgs the plastic feel that all are a little concerned about really should not be a concern  .
i have dropped it and not a thing has happened  .
however , i did not drop it from the top of a building side note   while we all should not be texting in work (snicker) i do i put a rubber backed body glove cover on the phone  .
keeps it still while i swype unfortunately i killed my sim  .
oops  .

on nov 14 , 2010  .
i'm a first time android/non physical keyboard user , but the experience has been great  .
the truth is i do not miss the physical keyboard and get used to the android operating system is very easy  .
i used to have a blackberry but this telephone is way much better  .
it's great for playing games with it's super bright screen and for viewing videos , but at the same time , for example , the avatar movie looks great , but who wants to watch this movie in a four    inch screen  .
but it is a nice touch as a bonus and it's appreciated  .
love task manager app , visual voice mail , g mail , voice search , accounts and sync  .
people complain that it feels very plastic , but the fact is that the back cover is made of plastic so how else is it going to feel  .
personally , i see it as a luxury phone , and i like it very much , plus it feels solid and sturdy in my hand  .
the camera is quite good even w/out flash  .
about the battery , i think they filled this cellphone with many features (plus the ones you want to add) but not prepared to offer good battery life  .
i mean , so many things you can do with it , you won' t put it down for a while  .
one thing , do not keep on charging the battery all the time , do it only when the phone tells you to , otherwise you will damage the battery's memory  .
i bought an additional battery and the charger for it and now i'm good to go at all times  .
if you don't wanna do this try to keep the brightness low , don't watch avatar , don't download too may apps , and don't play games (just kidding)  .
i did try disabling background data and worked for me  .
i just hope that android 2  .
2 will resolve this issue , because this cellphone is made to use and abuse  .
i also don't like the fact that every time the same number is dialed because the person don't answer on the other side , or you get a busy tone , the call log keeps on adding the same number again and again instead of counting the call as one  .
overall it's an excellent cellphone , so if you are a t    mo guy and can afford it , do not miss out on this beauty and it's features , just remember not to drop it and buy a nice case for it updated  .
on nov 14 , 2010  .
it's a feature phone at it's best and there's reasons why it's good enough or better than the iphone  .
a couple major dislike for the phone is that getting contact info from your previous phone  .
i tried to explain my issue with the transferring the contact info and on cons section  .
at the end of the day you still gotta manually punch in those numbers the battery  .
i think it's because im a first time user of this phone and basically is on the phone a lot to configure and exploring , but the device needs to be on the charger at all time basically , if you dont have at least two chargers at home and at work , you'll be worrying about low battery life all day long  .
it drains fast and doesnt charge up fast enough  .
to give you an idea , , if you charge it for an half a day , , it'll charge up to less than half full and it'll only take good 45 min or so time to drain the half of battery life atleast one third even with task killers , battery life save apps if you are thinking about getting one , dont hesitate , you wont regret it updated  .
on nov 13 , 2010  .
if you want to get a smart phone that will make people with iphones jealous , the vibrant is the best option available  .
it does almost everything an iphone does and even a few things the iphone doesn't do  .
samsung really gave smart phone users a lot to look forward with the galaxy s series phones  .
if i did not know better i'd assume they released this phone to compete directly with apple's coveted iphone as microsoft demonstrated in the 80's hardware ubiquity will always rule out over proprietary systems that merge hardware and software together i guess apple is expecting to repeat there past mistakes again , this time in the mobile market .
the vibrant is a amazing phone with a amazing processor and a sexy design plus its on t    mobile amazing network , but the screen really takes it toll on a already somewhat meager battery life , while i dont care it's plasticky (like bonnie said) as long as it's sturdy but this phone is not sturdy and i have almost no doubt that this phone would not survive a drop like some of the other plasticky phones out there (like my htc pure) but if you are going to buy this phone then you should but a case so that con is easily resolved , and theres not flash so if you wanted to take a picture in a low light situation then your up a creek without a paddle , the most noticeable cons are the sucky battery life and the no flash other than this phone is great  .
bottom line  .
this is my favorite phone to date  .
it's sleek , beautiful , fast , well built , lightweight , and an overall excellent phone  .
the flash would be nice but under the right settings the pictures come out great  .
i have this phone on the tmobile walmart family plan pros   settings in camera are pretty vast for a phone , with different modes and settings , zoom and autofocus  .
i used to have to wait at least 3    5 minutes for my iphone to turn on , this phone is less than a minute  .
maybe even less than 30 sec  .
apps open super fast and close super fast  .
i can actually delete songs i do not want in my library  .
(iphone no go)  .
no more dealing with itunes (thank god  .
)calendar is easy to sync with google , google voice works , and internet speeds are fast  .
speech to text is funand app selection is nice  .
i have lookout , which is not available on the iphone , and would help me locate my ohone and to backup data and run antivirus cons  the battery thing is an issue  .
the battery icon will look like it's at 80% when it's in fact more at like 50 or even 40  .
this is extremely misleading  .
when full up to 80% it's entirely filled in then it discreses minorly  .
when the battery looks like it's at 40% it's closer to 10  .
i'm not certain if this will be fixed but it's just a slight annoyance  .
even with these minor issues this phone is still my favorite phone of all time  .
battery life is also not what i'm used to  .
i could leave my iphone off the charger with the wifi turned on and my battery would last  .
first night i had this phone , i is confused when i had the phone fully charged and set it on the nightstand with the wifi on and it is at 20% the following morning  .
now i have app killer and charge the phone every night  .
when i play sims it gets pretty hot and apps will not open  .
had this happen once  .
not a big deal  .
i previously had an ihone 2g and this phone blows it out of the water and probably the 3gs as well  .
i had a problem when exiting an app the apps on the home screen would take 15 or more seconds to pop back up  .
this problem seems to have gone away .
i thought the rep is full of crap about it not being able to get scratched  .
three weeks of abuse later , and i'm a believer  .
this is amazing  .
yes , i deleted avatar and the sims there are good apps out there that i added  .
lots of fun so far  .
i am very impressed with the call quality  .
though i've heard that it drops calls , i have yet to experience this .
this phone is awesome  .
choosing the phone is by far the best idea i've ever had , and this is the best phone i've ever chosen  .
even compared to the iphone i is devastated when i traded my iphone for the hd2  .
i is foolish and didn't read up on the hd2  .
windows mobile is terrible   it lags and getting android on it is too much work  .
the market place is pitiful and over all the phone is a waste of money i is debating on whether or not to get another iphone or this phone i really wanted to use t    mobile's 3g so i opted for this one , since i wouldn't get 3g with the iphone  .
best idea ever i'm a fan of apple , but android marketplace is far from disappointing  .
most of the commonly used apps are free , and a lot of other apps that are fun and useful are free , too  .
i'm not disappointed at all  .
i still get my 16gb memory to load all of my music and on top of that i have an 8gb micro sd card (which you could not do with iphone) for even more space the touch screen is so easy to use , i'd have to say even easier than the iphone  .
swype is awesome , and easy to use and get used to android for the win  .
i will never go back to anything else updated  .
on oct 6 , 2010  .
big problem with the battery life and the android operating system in general is not friendly with microsoft outlook as far as syncing unless you are on a company exchange server android (google) wants you to sync in the cloud which is not good for important files  .
you have to find other software to sync with outlook if you do not want to use google  .
this causes a problem because now you have to work with another program to do what should be a simple job that now becomes a little more cumbersome  .
i found companionlink with dejaoffice that works pretty good for syncing gmail does not work well if you are a microsoft person , so you have to get another program to work like outlook  .
again , more cumbersome  .
i use k9 mail for this  .
works much better than gmail other than the battery life , email , and syncing , the phone is excellent  .
i will continue to use it until something better comes out with tmobile .
i love this phone and wouldn't change it for anything else  .
it works for me in a lot of ways  .
this is by far the best phone i have ever had  .
in my opinion , this phone would qualify on the list of top 5 cellular phones in the world  .
this phone is very versatile and well rounded as far as features and capabilities  .
however , no phone is perfect period  .
this phone has proven imperfection in several ways the biggest problem is battery life  .
the more things you do on the phone , the faster the battery dies  .
i hope either samsung or an aftermarket company would come out with a longer lasting battery soon  .
another big problem is gps  .
it works but it is really slow  .
my garmin gps is way faster  .
i think it is a problem that can be fixed though  .
another problem is that this is the first phone that i have ever owned that didn't have some type of missed call/voicemail indicator on the outside of the phone  .
i always have to turn on the screen and sometimes unlock the screen too  .
this is very annoying sometimes  .
now about flash , i think it's not fair that some phones carry it and other don't for the same or similar pricing  .
this si the only part of the phone were i think i got shaftd by t    mobile  .
for the price , an led flash should have been required  .
it does , however , take really clear day and night shots  .
as for the front cam , once again it's not fair for the price but i am not missing it  .
i consider that a luxury  .
over all , i would recommend this to anybody  .
i do not know of any other phone that can compare to this phones quality  .
i say , if you can afford it buy it  .
ok so i am a avid power user of my phone  .
i carry it everywhere and even sleep with it  .
i have to get a new phone every few months because i love gadgets  .
well that is until i landed a vibrant  .
ive had a mytouch  .
htc touch pro 2  .
my touch slide which i loved  .
a garmin phone and a hd2  .
the first time i saw the vibrant i is in a store to pay my bill and looked over and thought what the hell is this phone  .
i played with it a bit and the colors jumped out at me  .
it had 2  .
1 also and just blew me away  .
i knew i needed to have it but hell i just had settled on a mytouch slide  .
i went for a month and everytime i saw this little lady in a store i would begin to drool  .
i ended up selling my slide on craigslist and a plasma tv just so i could go buy the vibrant  .
damn is i sure happy i did  .
this phone is by far the most exciting phone i have ever held  .
its perfect in all ways  .
i use the camera for taking pictures that i use for posting ads on craigslist now  .
the video camera is awesome  .
i am on this phone non stop  .
the battery life isnt at all bad when you figure everything it does and the actually size of the phone  .
its super light which i love because i always keep my phone in my front pants pocket  .
a gel skin takes away that slick feel and face it you should have a protector on any phone you invest this kind of money in  .
i miss the led but its ok  .
that just uses more battery i suppose  .
dont care about a front facing camera i mean who really uses it all that often anyways  .
with this phone samsung has hit the ball out of the park  .
i is amazed because of the sheer disappointment i had in the behold 2 and felt like samsung just wouldnt produce a high end product  .
thank you so much  .
ive never been happier and i know for anyone that loves their phone and android you wont be disappointed in this  .
i even typed this whole review while on my phone .
functional and worth it .
if you are a techie the android platform is the way to go  .
tweaking this phone is not only fun but being able to squeeze top notch performance out of it is just plain awesome  .
i'm able to put full length 720p movies , music , documents and just about what ever strikes my fancy on it  .
its fast responsive and pound for pound the best phone i have owned  .
i have been with tmobile almost 15 years and have always upgraded to the top of the line phone they have available and this phone is the goods .
the samsung vibrant is one of the best phones out there in the market  .
it makes it a real competitor to the iphone .
i just purchased the vibrant and i have to say that i absolutely love this phone  .
i is so used to using the samsung messenger , that using a touch screen , just didnt want too  .
because i am moving out of state , i had to switch carriers getting the vibrant i have had it for a few days now and i noticed after i changed to default security code to my personal that i noticed when i turned the phone on to enter the security code , the screen would go black but the top tool bar is only showing  .
i would have to hit the house button for the screen to appear then enter the code  .
it is not doing that before  .
has any one had this issue  .
if you have the answer , please post it on http  //www  .
samsungvibrantforum  .
com thanks a lot  .

on sep 4 , 2010  .
after a month and a half with this phone i finally feel ready to give an informed opinion about it i like the form factor a lot  .
very slim for such a big screen  .
some folks have complained about the lightness of the device stating it feels flimsy , but i think it's a huge positive  .
doesn't drag your pocket down as some previous smartphones have  .
no physical keyboard hasn't been an issue at all for me , but might for someone with long fingernails  .
swype for typing takes a bit of getting used to but it fast and efficient battery life is good  .
clearly the battery will drain if you're doing a lot of activities that involve the screen being on a lot , but in my case i only charge every 2    3 days  .
the back of the phone does get a bit warm if you're using the screen for an extended period of time , like playing a game or watching video the bundled apps are good and there's plenty more at the android market  .
the sims game is garbage and frequently crashes  .
call quality is excellent as is wifi range and gps  .
screen quality is beautiful with excellent color rendering  .
the device is quick and never seems to bog down even when using multiple apps i like the camera quality and options for low light conditions , though a led flash would have been nice  .
720p video is a home run  .
i also love that you can change the battery on your own and pick and choose the storage you like via microsd card  .
hot swapping memory is a plus since you do not need to remove the battery to change the memory card  .
16 gigs of internal memory is more than sufficient overall it's a very useful device that can deliver information on the go quickly and easily  .
integration with google is excellent from calendaring , contacts and maps  .
with outlook exchange support in the next upgrade (2  .
2 froyo) this device will be a world beater .
this is my first android device and i love the darn thing , the only things keeping me from giving this 5 stars are no camera flash or front facing camera  .
looking forward to froyo in september  .
i have not had any gps issues with my phone  .
highly recommend this device , keep your eyes peeled for free after rebate deal from walmart  .
com  .
you cannot beat free for a high    end phone updated  .
on aug 31 , 2010  .
this is a simply wonderful device  .
i have had almost the entire lineup of tmobile's high tier smart phones over the past couple of years and this one is , hands down , the best ever  .
i is concerned about not having a physical keyboard , seeing as i recently upgraded from a cliq , but it is barely noticable not having one  .
i appreciate that it seems as though samsung will stand behind this line of galaxy s phones with a suitable timeframe to upgrade to android 2  .
all programs run impressively and the phone is crazy fast  .
i've heard about issues with the gps , but have not personally experienced any myself  .
if you are a tmobile customer and do not own this phone you better order one asap  .
okay , so i used to have a first generation iphone  .
it is cool for awhile because there is nothing at all out there that anyone of us had really seen to wow us into oblivion but after about 6 months , i is fed up with it  .
so many limitations , i just cancelled my contract with the iphone and switched to a cheap handset and got an ipod touch  .
that worked for a long while , but when i went into t    mobile and saw this phone , i is absolutely awed  .
i love the lightweight feel (doesn't feel like i'm holding a brick) and learning to use swype is becoming my main avenure for inputting text  .
i've downloaded nothing but free apps from the android market and most of them are pretty cool  .
it felt good to break of from at t and get this sleek phone  .
i've had ppl aske me already what kind of phone i have and nothing but compliment after compliment about the vibrant  .
everyone and their grandma has an iphone or a blackberry i'm so glad i bucked the trend finally and went with what i deem to myself as being original now , the only con about the vibrant is the battery life  .
when i did my research here on cnet and other sites as well , that is what everyone is saying  .
i didn't believe it  .
i is thinking to myself do not ppl charge their phones every night  .
i mean , i'm basically ocd , so i have to have everything in it's place , etc  .
, and i always charge my phone at the end of the day  .
most times , i never have one bar from my battery drained , but the battery life on the vibrant is always needing a second charge about the time i get home from work  .
the good thing is that the phone will tell you what is using your battery the most , so i've made some adjustments , etc  .
, but i think a car charger is going to be my next purchase other than that , i have to rate this phone very high  .
would have given 5 stars if the battery could last a full day on a single charge , but 4  .
5 is still aces in my book .
one of the best android phones available today and will be even better when it is upgraded to android 2  .
2 next month .
this phone is amazing with all the nice features and preloaded avatar  .
the only problems is the start up time taking almost a min to start and finish loading (coming from nokia n95) and th e lack of a directional key so when i type something wrong i usually have to delete the qords infront poof error due to my fat thumbs  .
also cant wait for android 2  .
2 so i can finally go on hulu  .
this phone is almost 5 stars  .
i left sprint for this phone and it is well worth it  .
i find myself using it for everything  .
the t    mobile service is also much better the sprint's .
as a first time smart phone buyer i had nothing to compare this phone to  .
but i think it's a great phone and lives up to my expectations  .
it's a well put together package  .
even though it has a plastic body  .
the screen is large and the image quality is great  .
very responsive touch screen  .
the battery life is not the best , but it's long enough for me  .
i really do not live off of my phone  .
i would highly recommend this phone for first time users or experienced  .
if you plan on sticking with t    mobile , then get this phone .
i've used the iphone 4 before i purchased the vibrant and i thought it is a good phone , but the vibrant is much better  .
do you really need a front facing camera  .
do you really need a flash on your cell phone  .
no , that's why you have a digital camera  .
android os is a lot better and easy to use  .
once 2  .
2 comes up , you can view full website , flash and all  .
the battery does get eaten up pretty quick o this phone so be sure to invest in a car charger , and keep one at your desk if you plan on being on it a lot  .
the quality of the screen is ridiculous and you will be blown away  .
enjoy  .
this is hands    down the best phone i've owned  .
as an android early    adopter i've been waiting for a next gen android phone to replace my t    mobile g1 , and the vibrant delivers  .
since 2  .
1 supports multi    touch , tapping away emails and text are smooth enough to replace the physical keyboard i thought i'd miss  .
if it were not for the spotty gps (an issue that samsung has officially said they are working toward fixing very soon) i'd have given this phone a 5 out of 5 stars  .
as of right now the gps works well enough on freeways and larger thoroughfares  .
but struggles on smaller suburban areas  .
that being said , all of the other features on the phone continue to blow me away .
out of all of the cons , none of them made me think twice about getting this phone  .
i had the original android g1 up until the purchase of this phone and no physical keyboard scared me a bit  .
once i used the phone in the store , i is hooked and swype really made the decision easier for me  .
i can live with all of the cons i listed in this review , however the half of a star i took off is mainly for the lack of a trackball  .
i really liked using it to correct anything i is typing on the g1 but the size of the vibrants screen helps place the marker just where i need it  .
i would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking to upgrade , or switch over to tmobile  .
i have been a loyal customer for years and thier customer service has been nothing short of exceptional .
awesome phone and i'd recommend it above the other smart phones on the market  .
before deciding , call tmobile and advise them you're trying to decide between certain phones you can get a great deal on service  .
if it were not for this phone i would be on verizon right now  .
the features make this blow other t    mobile phones out of the water and into the hand of you grandma  .
anyone who has tmobile needs to upgrade to this phone as soon as possible  .
the minor flaws are not enough to keep me away it is the best phone i have ever used  .
would recommend this phone over the iphone  .
android apps rock over apple apps  .
open source is the way to go .
hands down , this phone is the very best smartphone i've ever owned or played with  .
i had an htc dash , followed by an htc g1 , followed by an htc hd2  .
i've toyed around with iphone 3's , 4's , the original droid , and the evo first and foremost , the display on the vibrant is an absolute pleasure to look at and use    deep blacks , great color saturation , good contrast , smooth feel , super responsive , and a great size  .
due to the brilliance in colors , i rate it on par with the iphone 4 , despite the iphone's higher pixel count the browser , video playback , and other elements of the user interface are buttery smooth with little to no lag thanks to the 1ghz hummingbird samsung included the touchwiz 3  .
0 user interface which is actually really good  .
the look is very pretty and i feel that it adds a nice touch to the phone with side    to    side scrolling of your app tray , wi    fi/gps toggle buttons right on the notification pull    down , 7 home screens , cool widgets , and a really fun unlock screen the phone is thin and light which is great , but i think i'd prefer a bit more weight  .
in addition , the plastic battery cover leaves a bit to be desired  .
i could go for something with a bit more grip or weight vs  .
the cheap/slippery plastic one provided  .
i'm sure we'll see 3rd party battery covers not before long other cons are the omission of a front    facing camera and led notifications  .
lastly , they did not include an led flash , which i don't necessarily need for picture    taking (samsung includes a great night shooting mode that is sufficient for me) but i loved having one on my hd2 for use as a flashlight the phone ships with android 2  .
1 , but samsung and t    mobile have both confirmed that it will be upgraded to 2  .
2 before the end of this year  .
that should add a whole new level of awesomeness to the phone  .
without my above listed cons , the phone would be a 4  .
9/5  .
0 (which is unheard of for any gadget i've ever owned)  .
overall , i'm really satisfied with the device and would recommend it to anyone (over any phone) who does not require a front    facing camera .
the bottom line is   if you want a great android    get this phone , or if you want the iphone w/o the at t    get this phone  .
seriouly , i have had this phone since july 15 and have put it to what i think should be real world tests and it passed all of them  .
i will outline a few concerns i have read the first being the camera  .
the camera is a pro and con  .
a pro b/c it takes great pics (even in low light , turn on night mode and your low light situation will look like a bright day)  .
however , the lack of a flash does make extremely dark party situations difficult  .
but to be frank , i would recomend a small point and shoot for a party over any phone camera/led flash the second is the battery   which is honestly pretty good  .
its only problem is the screen  .
for example , if you simply play music files , pandora (or the like) , and make calls and rarely use the screen you will find the battery last longer  .
oh and simple things like turning off the gps , increasing app network update times , and decreasing screen brightness will all increase life  .
here is an outline of my phone life lasting 20 hours unplugged   facebook/twitter updates every 4 hours , yahoo/gmail every 30 min , gchat always on and chatted for 2 hours off and on , 100 txts sent/received , 50 min phone convo , 1  .
5 hr hd video ,  .
5 hour music ,  .
25 hour youtube ,  .
25 photo gallery ,  .
5 pandora , 1 hr tower defense game ,  .
5 hr sims (great game btw) ,  .
25 min downloading apps (on edge where im at    ( ) and  .
25 min messing with my contact list  .
other times the phone is idle  .
this is all a rough guess but pretty spot on  .
its a good battery that i did charge when it still had 20% life left so it probably could have gone longer  .
but then i have also used the phone w\for 3 days w/o charging making only calls and listing to music  .
so it all depends on what you do the phone is not perfect but is a great device  .
there is really no reason to say do not buy unless you physically pick up this phone , use it and still do not care for it  .
but i bet that its screen , processor speed and look of the ui will win over most any one  .
i hope that some of this review has been helpful to someone   )    djm7  .
honestly this phone is just amazing and i do not know how else to put it it is also a true world phone unlike the droid x  .
i thought about switching to the iphone 4 but after getting my hands on this thing it is a wrap  .
if this phone had the same pub as the iphone or droid phones it would win every award .
this is a great phone  .
fast and responsive , even stuff that comes over the slower edge network appears to be faster  .
i love it  .
great phone  .
i am very happy  .
i am loyal android fan , but is very unhappy with my moto cliq  .
this phone has a beautiful screen and the hd movies look incredible  .
it has enterprise features that i really missed from my blackberry and have not seen on other android phones  .
it looks a lot like an iphone on the exterior (is this a con , maybe  .
) , but do not be fooled it is totally android with some of the best features i've seen so far  .
oh and the phone is super fast  .
i love it .
i read the cnet review and do not agree with camera  .
i took multiple shots in low light which displayed natural reproduction of colors and crisp clear shots (use night mode  .
) flash would have been ideal but i do not think that one or two small leds or even a tiny xenon would creat a big difference  .
if it does make a difference to you , you should keep a pocket camera  .
the device is very light and fits well into medium size hand  .
there is haptic feedback to the keys pressed  .
the phone can breeze through the menu and internet downloads are brisk  .
t    mobile has front clear cover and protective case as well as a portable car charger available for tomorrow  .
there is a mail    in    rebate of usd 50  .
so , the upfront price you pay will be usd 250  .
00 with a qualified new contract/upgrade etc updated  .
on jul 17 , 2010  .
it's really the best of all worlds  .
it's light    weight and fast  .
i could not believe how quick the web pages loaded  .
it's almost like i had dsl  .
with all the different apps like ebuddy and gmail , i'm connected all the time to all my different accounts  .
everything is so simple to use yet so powerful in an unexpected way  .
love it  .
pretty good phone , like i said beautiful screen  .
its very responsive with the 1ghz processor  .
its pretty awesome watching videos on it  .
with that being said , the gps out of the box did not work  .
only way it'll work with the fix found online  .
battery life sucks , a drawback for a screen that is super bright and amazing .
love the phone now that i discovered launcher pro  .
i highly reccomend this as it just makes the phone run so smooth  .
you get the smoothness of the ios with android which is a dream  .
android is amazing  .
froyo needs to be updated  .
known gps issues still not fixed 2 months after release , but samsung is working on it  .
best phone on tmobile by far  .
i wish the 3g wasnt so spotty , though its so fast when it works   )  .
highly recommended starting with price , features , especially display , satisfactory battery life the galaxy s series , especially the vibrant , is a winner .
purchased the vibrant two days ago , and so far i love it  .
the only problems i've encountered is when syncing movies , music , and pictures from my mac , it is possible if the usb debugger feature is enabled in the phones settings , but this should be automatic for people who aren  .
t technically savvy , but it is possible  .
other then this small irritation everything else is great  .
i give it four start had it seamlessly worked with mac it would have been 5   )  .
overall , this phone is the best t    mobile has in stock  .
i had an hd2 and boomeranged that sucker back  .
but i had an unlocked iphone for 1 year and is just tired of unlocking/updating it  .
plus , i could not secure my phone  .
this is the next best thing i am a slow texter/writer on the phone  .
i am the finger point kinda of person  .
but swype has changed my speed and capacity  .
i can respond to work emails quickly and text people in a heartbeat  .
i love swype as for battery life , i am getting a solid 14 hours and then with 30% left  .
i just changed settings to 10 minutes for email sync and 2g  .
prior to that , my phone lasted only 8 hours  .
i do miss the movie rentals at itunes and my itunes playlist  .
this is the phone i have been waiting for  .
much better then the my touch which i did not like  .
my gps works fine so maybe that is kind of touch and go on the phone  .
note   gps does not work inside a building , you have to be outside with a direct line of sight to the sky  .
actually everything works fine on my phone  .
this is an absolutely outstanding phone for media  .
the screen is large , bright , and high    resolution , making it a joy to watch web videos or movies  .
the rear    mounted speaker is loud enough for showing videos to friends , but the fact that it is rear    mounted means that the sound is muffled if you set the phone down  .
the screen is also large enough and bright enough to be suitable as an e    book reader       i read kindle books on mine relatively comfortably  .
the web browser is fast and multi    touch pinch and zoom is a welcome upgrade from my previous , android 1  .
6 phone  .
i haven't tried the tv output  .
games , such as the included sims 3 , perform excellently with high frame    rate 3d graphics the large screen and light weight makes the phone rest somewhat awkwardly in the hands , and you might find it slipping out of your fingers if you don't invest in a gel case with some grip  .
the phone also gets hot       that's the powerful processor and gpu running , and draining battery fast the camera is a pleasant surprise  .
photos are crisp and low    light shooting could be a lot worse  .
video recording quality is absolutely top    drawer , with smooth hd at 720p in addition to the many excellent features supplied by android itself , the vibrant also has samsung's useful ui additions  .
i particularly like being able to keep my work email and gmail separate , but have calendar events from both services merged into a single unified calendar the inclusion of excellent touchscreen keyboard alternatives such as swype mitigates the lack of a physical keyboard a bit  .
given the light weight and large size of the phone , a slide    out keyboard as on the mytouch slide would have been an excellent addition that would not add too much weight or bulk for my tastes  .
however , the physical controls i miss the most are the menu , home , search , and back keys  .
on the vibrant they are touch    sensitive areas which are all but invisible when they are not backlit , forcing me to remember where they are with no haptic feedback until i've already pressed one of them  .
a touchpad , as on the mytouch slide , or a trackball , as on the mytouch 3g , is also missing the gps appears to be slow , and other applications appear to slow down when it is running  .
the compass appears to work very poorly , taking a long time to reorient itself when the phone moves  .
you'll notice that especially in google sky map , which is much less useful on the vibrant than on either of the mytouch phones call quality is excellent and reception is good the cons i've listed do not really change the fact that this is the most powerful android phone on t    mobile and has one of the best screens i've ever seen on a phone  .
coupled with a surprisingly good camera and the excellent android operating system , the screen makes this phone the best choice for t    mobile customers looking for a phone with serious multi    media and/or gaming capabilities .
we have mytouch , smasung behold etc and this is by far a superior product  .
just large enough to enjoy reading or watching a movie , and just small enough to still be called a phone  .
any bigger and it would be an inconvenience to lug around .
this phone stopped me from switching to at t/iphone  .
at first i still had the but its not an iphone attitude  .
now that i've had a chance to use the phone more i no longer feel that way  .
i have found an android version of all the apps that i use and i get way better data speeds at a way better price with much better customer service than my att/iphone counterparts  .
all my iphone friends are jealous of the speeds i get with my vibrant on t    mobile (they are also jealous of my swypeing capabilities) while no front facing camera and no flash are cons , they aren't really a big deal to me  .
even with out a flash the camera takes excellent pictures  .
what is a big deal to me is the battery life which seems to be poor (i even have screen brightness turned all the way down and gps/wi    fi/bluetooth , etc off) overall this is an excellent device which you can use on a super fast , affordable network  .
quite honestly i could care less now whether the iphone ever comes to t    mobile  .
honestly i hope it does not       all the data hogs and network problems can stay on at t  .
although i wonder if t    mobile would constantly blame its customers for its problems like at t does  .
i would without a doubt recommend and buy this phone again  .
this is the best phone that i have ever owned  .
i is going to replace my old 1st gen iphone with the iphone 4  .
however , after seeing this phone , i knew that i had to have it  .
after looking at this phones interface , i feel the ios4 interface looks like an old version of windows .
i upgraded from the htc google g1  .
i really enjoyed using the g1 but my biggest gripe is the horrible battery life  .
4    5 hours max without having to plug in to charge  .
also i was not a fan of touch screen phones  .
i really liked the g1 keyboard  .
i is very hesitant to switch to a touchscreen  .
however , it took only 1 day of playing around with the swype and i really enjoy using swype now  .
this phone suits all my needs and as long as samsung and other companies continue to put out nice products on the android platform i will continue to give a big middle finger to apple .
i have suffered with t    mobile phones to the point of getting an unlocked iphone , great but no 3g  .
i is ready to bail after having 6 phones on t    mobile for 8 years  .
i is just waiting for the iphone 4  .
i checked out and researched the iphone 4 , droid x , and evo  .
the vibrant holds it's own in all reviews i've seen  .
its not as intuitive as the iphone , takes a little more to navigate  .
overall i'm happy and i get to stay with t    mobile which still has the best customer service updated  .
on jul 19 , 2010  .
if you`re a regular android user looking for a better smart phone from t    mobile , this is it  .
i consider myself as a power cell phone user and customized the phone in only 2 days  .
call quality is excellent  .
the smart phone is as big as the htc hd2 , but it is so thin that , once in your hand , it doesn`t seem that big  .
it is very snappy and responsive  .
customizing this phone is allot of fun and i am pleased with it`s performance  .
there are many apps that can be bought on the android market (and free ones too) that really make this phone stand out  .
my personal opinion about this phone is this   this is a smart phone for smart people , not a smart phone for dumb people who use the iphone  .
design and hardware    .
the vibrant is quite an elegant phone , with a thin profile , rounded edges , beautiful screen , and clean look  .
it measures 4  .
82 inches tall by 2  .
54 inches wide by  .
39 inches thick and weighs 4  .
16 ounces , making a lightweight phone that falls in between the iphone and the droid x in terms of size  .
unlike the new generation of giant phones (evo 4g , hd2 , and droid x) the vibrant easily slips in and out pockets , while fitting nicely in any size hand  .
to cut down on weight the vibrant is made of plastic , which we are not too happy about  .
personally we have found that denser phones (although heavier) tend to feel sturdier  .
we greatly prefer the construction of the nexus one , which is made of metal , in comparison to the vibrant software and features    .
the vibrant runs android 2  .
1 skinned with samsung  .
s touchwiz 3  .
0 interface  .
we must admit we have not been fans of the touch wiz interface in the past and often found it clunky and useless in comparison to htc  .
s sense ui  .
however 3  .
0 brings some great improvements to the interface , but it is still no match for sense  .
samsung has added some new widgets such as feeds and updates which streams updates from all of the user  .
s social    networking sites  .
the feature allows lists to be updated up to every 30 minutes , but it may be wise to lengthen the refresh rate in order to conserve battery performance    .
the 5    mp camera on the vibrant is a mixed bag  .
if used outside or in great lighting conditions it produces fantastic pictures such as the one below on the left  .
this picture could easily pass of as a photo taken with a point    and    shoot camera  .
if the lighting conditions were poor the pictures were not very good to say the least (picture on the right)  .
why there is no flash on this phone is puzzling  .
on the upside , the features available when taking pictures are great  .
they include   auto focus , white balance , iso , and scence modes , effects , and adjustable exposure check out full review at link below thanks  .

com/2010/07/15/samsung    vibrant    galaxy    s    review/  .
as long as you're not the type to palm your phone when talking on it then you'll be fine but if you do then you might want to wait for samsung to address this antenna issue  .
overall this is an amazing phone hence my 4 out of 5 stars  .
if it did not have the antenna issue then i would have given it 5 stars .
i am going to disappoint the readers who are looking for a review  .
i chanced to look at this phone on amazon at is priced at 99  .
99 with 2 yr contract  .
at radioshack and t    mobile it is 199  .
99 as promised  .
that is just ridiculous for a phone this good (or a typo )  .
readers interested in the phone might be be well served to check it out    .

this is not an ad , although i would totally understand if the post is removed by the mods for those reasons  .
i really had the best of interests of the cnet readers at heart .
if you are an iphone fan you will like this set  .
if you want an good android device you better wait , if not root it , it needs major gui reconstruction  .
this is one of many smartphones that can stand up and compare best to an iphone  .
samsung has made many great products and still continue to amaze me  .
but if samsung can work on fixing the battery life , battery charging and software glitches then this phone will take over the market in smartphones .
very cool phone , but would be much better if the gps worked .
over all an excellent phone  .
fast on the 3g hspa+ t    mobile network , this is even at peak times  .
screen clarity is great  .
i love the swype feature on texting and typing  .
the phone is quick on response  .
i like that its capable of being upgraded to froyo 2  .
definately worth its purchase price  .
take it from a former iphone 3gs 32gig owner .
overall its a great phone for a great price (with a 2 year contract of course) the screen is the best i've seen yet  .
the responds of the phone is quick and easy to customise  .
the battery is my biggest concerned , i did a test in one day (3 hrs of display will use 49% of battery use) (10 mins of phone use will use 20% of battery) (cell stand by 7hrs used up 14% of battery) (phone idle 6hrs used up 9% of battery) (android system 8 mins used up 5% of battery use) (sms texting 7 mins used up 3% of battery) overall it is +/    3 1/2 hrs of phone usage (updating my facebook , took a couple of videos and playbacks , text 15 times , used the phone for 10 mins , went online and used some apps) by then it is down to 18% of battery life .
antenna seems to be the problem  .
samsung better fix it or they will lose their market .
bought the phone yesterday and the first day , brand new , on a full charge , the phone lasted only 7  .
5 hours  .
and this is on a day when i is on    set (i'm a cameraman , ) and could not even accept voice calls  .
i took a few breaks through the day to check and answer emails , used maps once and is fastidious about using a task    killer to kill background apps from eating battery life  .
i knew the phone's display ate a lot of battery power , so i is extremely anal about shutting it down , closing apps and turning off gps wifi  .
i have no use for a phone that cannot get me though a day without carrying a charger with me , no matter how many cool apps it has .
the biggest con about the samsung vibrant is that it is on t    mobile's crappy network  .
i keep on telling myself it is time to change , but i guess i enjoy the pain a couple other issues battery is pretty weak for the phone they put it in  .
you need a kill    app app to manage the apps that are sucking down the juice  .
aggravated by the fact that i have to keep my wi    fi on at home because i only get one bar (if i'm lucky)in a suburban washington dc neighborhood i suspect the better choice would have been to switch to the evil empire of verizon and by a droid x  .
i'll still give the phone three stars because it is easily one of the top 4 phones in the market .
this phone looks great  .
the swyping increased my texting speed considerably and made my transition from a g1 smooth  .
the processor allows me to do multiple tasks at once without slowing down or pausing  .
the screen is amazing  .
the camera is a 5mp camera and has focusing that lets you choose the subject , hd quality video , and helps get rid of hand jittering  .
this camera is way better than the one on my g1 , despite not having a flash  .
regarding talking to my mac , my g1 would connect via bluetooth but couldn't share files  .
the vibrant successfully shares files via bluetooth deal breaker   the gps connectivity is poor  .
i am only able to connect to 1or 2 satellites , but most of the time i'm connected to zero  .
if i don't turn on the use wireless networks in the location security settings , then i don't ever get a location on the gps  .
on my g1 , i didn't ever have that setting on and i is always connected to the satellites  .
there are rumors of an update for this , but i'll believe it when i see it  .
do a google search and you'll find several forums addressing this issue not deal breakers   there is no led indicator light on the phone anywhere  .
if you want to know if you have a missed call or text , you have to unlock the phone and light up the screen  .
i got very used to my g1 telling me with a flashing light when i missed something  .
several owners found that the avatar movie doesn't come with a license and will fail to play on the phone  .
be sure to test this in    store if this is important to you  .
next , there are oodles of apps included with the phone  .
some of these are trials and require monthly subscriptions , including gogo inflight internet , telenav gps navigator , and mobitv  .
the mediahub software that plays avatar is not yet live and therefore cannot be updated  .
mediahub is samsung's version of a rent , buy , download tv shows and movies coming soon  .
no front facing camera means no video chats  .
bummer , but not a deal breaker for me  .
next , in order to mount my sd card on my mac , i have to turn on debugging  .
not a huge problem , but makes me question samsung's intention of maintaining mac compatibility with their phones  .
finally , the voice commands on this phone are pretty lame  .
you can call , you can search , but you cannot really do much else  .
i would've like to have voice    to    text built in , seeing as how google already built the framework for it and other t    mobile phones have it conclusion   i hope to keep the phone  .
i've had it for 4 days now and played around with it extensively  .
it runs fast  .
the screen is great  .
if they do not fix the gps connectivity i may , sadly , have to return it  .
if i ever leave an area with wi    fi signals , i would be completely off their grid  .
if i keep it , i'll definitely get a housing of some sort as the phone feels like it may be easy to break  .
the android market has apps for free/purchase that deal with some of the other issues i mentioned , like the voice    to    text feature .
i'm sure i'll get a ton of negative responses for this calling me a noob and giving me thumbs down but i don't care  .
ive been with t    mobile for over 5 years and have had a blackberry the entire time  .
before that i had a blackberry with spring  .
i have been a loyal blackberry owner  .
of course , i is intrigued by the iphone and craved a touchscreen  .
i had an iphone for about 2 months when this phone came out  .
i went to the store , played with it a little , then at a tmo (my husband is an employee) picnic , samsung had a booth and i played with it some more i went online , read all the rave reviews about the phone and finally decided to go with it  .
i admit , i love the phone  .
i love the touch screen , i love the beautiful display , the 16gb internal memory and memory card slot    awesome  .
most of the apps are incredible (facebook being my biggest disappointment but i don  .
t think that  .
s a samsung issue  .
) , i love the android platform , i like the touch screen keyboard versus the blackberry keyboard b/c i have ra and pushing the buttons on the bb keyboard can become tiresome  .
again , overall , i like the features of the phone but  .
two of the cons i have are deal breakers for me   dropping calls ; not syncing emails consistently  .
i use my phone for business a lot and i  .
m in the car a lot  .
tmo tries to attribute the dropped calls to me being in the car and moving from a good signal to a bad  .
but i never had this issue with blackberry  .
d say the blackberrys would drop a call once every 4    5 months , if that  .
and the vibrant drops calls daily  .
s incredibly annoying the second con is that i go three    four days sometimes without getting a single email and then bam  .
i get all of them from the last few days  .
then i  .
ll get email consistently for a few days and it starts all over again  .
this doesn  .
t happen with gmail but i don  .
t want to use gmail for everything  .
i don  .
t mind gmail but my yahoo is tied to so many things  .
yes i know i can forward my yahoo to my gmail , but that  .
s not good enough for me  .
they should be able to fix this without me having to work around their mistakes  .
i have three yahoo inboxes  .
m not going through that  .
even when i go to the inbox and  .
refresh  .
it doesn  .
t push my emails through  .
s incredibly frustrating the phone also randomly reboots itself  .
every few days it will just restart  .
i don  .
t usually mind this because it  .
s not when i  .
m on a call or using it , but it  .
s still ridiculous sometimes when i  .
m trying to make a call , the phone will show it  .
s connecting but it won  .
t connect  .
i can press end , then i have to restart the phone to make the call  .
has nothing to do with signal , sometimes i  .
m showing full bars  .
unless the signal is showing falsely , which wouldn  .
t surprise me i'm waiting for the g2 to come out , except that i dont really want a slide phone and i do not want to go aback to a blackberry but it looks like that's the direction i'm heading .
i am a t    mobile employee , and i can tell you that we have had just as many of these phones returned that we have sold  .
the phone is absolute garbage  .
the screen is absolutely awesome , and is very responsive to the touch , however the capacative buttons do not work (this is happening all galaxy s phones)  .
the gps is unusable , as it will never pinpoint your location any better than a thousand meters , and one of our phones at the store actually says we are in new jersey no matter where we are  .
when you combine the cheap build of the phone , along with the horrible service that t    mobile has in most metro areas (i cannot use t    mobile at all in my area , even though according to the website i should be getting excellent coverage) , you have a recipie for disaster  .
i an average day i return at least three of these phones due to these issues  .
your welcome to email me and i can tell you a lot more problems we are experiencing with the phones  .
by far it is the worse launch we have ever had , aside from the garminphone  .
even though i am an employee , i have to say that i am embarassed at the new android offering we have for the public .
htc trumps samsung i'm returning my vibrant and going to wait a little bit to see if t    mobile gets a better phone or samsung fixes the battery life issue .
i really wanted to like this phone  .
i have been using blackberries since they came out and is hoping that this would be a great device to kick the crackberry habit my issues with the phone   the samsung sync software is pretty lame , won't transfer contact pictures , won't transfer calendar appointments unless they are saved to the personal calendar (personal folders) , and fails to sync/poll my pop3 accounts according to scheduled intervals , and to top it off when i get new emails it does not display the alert for the first couple of days the wireless (t    mobile) connection kept crashing displaying an error message and then restarting  .
over and over the screen is great  .
the interface is great  .
the apps are great  .
but when core functionality (pim sync and email) is missing it kind of kills anything good about the device .
nice try t    mobile  .
unfortunately the blackberry and the vibrant are not going to be able to do everything that a user wants  .
maybe in 2 years when my at t contract is up .
i would rate this phone 4 stars had samsung spent some time testing this product before shipping it off to customers  .
let me explain the gps and compass on this phone are both broken , it does not accurately track your location even if you are standing still  .
your heading points in all sorts of directions  .
coming from a previous android phone which is used extensively as my navigation device , this left me sorely dissapointed  .
there are manual fixes out that some claim fix the issue temporarily or make little to no difference at all  .
all galaxy s phones (vibrant t    mobile , captivate att , fascinate verizon) utilize the same hardware/software and are affected by this  .
samsung's low key approach to addressing this issue is very disconcerting .
i will return this device and move to verizon and getting the droid x as soon as its available on the 3rd of august .
i had great hopes for this phone but in the end is disappointed  .
a first i is amazed by the number of features , screen quality and browser  .
i is super excited about mobitv until i discovered that i could not get adequate audio volume from it  .
i is excited about the facebook widget until i discovered it didn ; 't link to the full browser or youtube app  .
coming from a blackberry pearl , i is excited about the mulitimedia features until i discovered audio glitches (here and elsewhere) and slow response in the headphone pause , low volume in the headphones when calling , inability to go forward or back in the playlist via hardware buttons  .
when pausing music via the headphone toggle button , instead of immediately stopping , there is a slight delay very often accompanied by a little audio glitch as the music fades out  .
doing anything requires navigating the software  .
a dozen things i can do on my blackberry via a single button require my full attention navigating on screen  .
result   doing almost anything requires much longer and full attention on screen , often involving navigating the interface though several screens  .
even ending a call required i turn the screen on first to activate the phone screen and then hit the on screen end button  .
that freaked me out the real killer for me though is having no led indicator light  .
a couple of days without this is enough to know i could never live with this phone  .
it is like going from having a old but trusted personal assistant who always kept you abreast of what is going on to a sexy new one that would not tell you a thing without having to ask first  .
until you lose it you cannot imagine how critically important the led indication of new messages and battery status is updated  .
on jul 26 , 2010  .
love this phone but i do not think i can live with the fact that i cannot enjoy it's full potential  .
i fear it is going back .
beautiful screen , and when it works i love it , but this phone constantly freezes  .
i have to reboot it almost once a day  .
i've reduced the number of apps and it still freezes  .
the nav program that came with the phone will simply stop working half way through a trip (highly inconvenient) , and google maps freezes often as well .
