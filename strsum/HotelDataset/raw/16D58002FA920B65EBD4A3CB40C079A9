this hotel , while in a historically significant building ( as explained on its website ) , is very modern in style .
as for location : i came in from the airport on the train .
it was a bit inconvenient getting to the hotel , as the train station is on the other side of a very busy main road , so you have to walk a little bit to a crossing to cross over .
taxis are so cheap in warsaw that next time i wouldn’t bother with the train and would get a taxi instead .
the hotel is a bit of a walk from the center of the old city , so wouldn’t be the first choice of someone who wanted to be right in the heart of the old city .
but i’m a keen walker and was fine seeing things along the way as i walked there .
i stayed in room 33b , which has a flat screen tv that can be used as a computer monitor , and also a coffee table , decent desk , minibar , safe , and walk-in wardrobe with full-length mirror .
the bathroom has a shower ( but no bath ) , a full-length mirror and l’occitane products .
i had problems trying to get the showerhead up high enough to be a convenient height for someone as tall as me .
the hair dryer was a bit hard to find , but i eventually tracked in down in a cloth bag .
i really liked the hotel .
unless i needed to be . . .

unless i needed to be in a particular location somewhere else , i would stay here again on future trips to warsaw.
