had a lovely break with a four bedroom chalet , clean and cosy with woodland animals always in site from doors for kids .
swimming pool is ace , you can swim outside in the rapids and see the steam from the pool , my little girl thought this was great !
- tip is to go swimming late at night - open till 9pm , its so quiet and chilled. .
we went with 2 toddlers and a baby , my little girl did keep fit with rupert the bear for a fiver and my partner did quad biking for £30 for an hour , both enjoyed these .
the local supermaket has minii trolleys that my little girl loved .
down points for me is the expensive food , i like to have a mix of cheap and expensive meals but every meal was costly , curry house was the worst for cost and the american diner where just a burger and chips is £12 .
00 and thats the cheapest meal. .
spa on site was busy and £37 .
00 just for use of sauna and jacuzzi but after spending most the week in the pool i wanted more , so found a spa hotel 5 mins drive away that did a deal for £25 for use of spa and a massage and it was fab ! !
- it was called cumberland park hotel .
would deffo go again but eat in more , taking bikes was nice , and toddler disco in leisure centre was nice . . . .
