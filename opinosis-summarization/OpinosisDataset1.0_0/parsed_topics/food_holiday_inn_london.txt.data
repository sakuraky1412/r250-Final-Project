 the room was packed to capacity with queues at the food buffets .

 the over zealous   staff cleared our unfinished drinks while we were collecting cooked food and movement around the room with plates was difficult in the crowded circumstances .

 there are a couple pubs, a great patisserie and even fast food restaurants within a block .

the neighborhood is an upscale residential area full of restaurants in easy walking distance ranging from  fast food  to up, scale with a wide variety of cuisines , ,  we never had a bad meal .

the food   was wonderful, a selection of sandwiches, salads, cous cous and spicy wedge potato's, fruit salad and a cake was a good fill up when needed .

full english breakfast was included in our rate and was very good indeed ,  staff were busy clearing tables promptly and fresh food kept arriving all the time .

 one local restaurant stood out for having excellent food,  olives  located one block away .

,  great location  ,  very good selection of food for breakfast buffet .

 i can't see what sets it apart from other 3, star hotels i've stayed in ,  other than the fact it's in london, in a posh area and has good food .

 we ate breakfast at the hotel a couple of days and thought it was overprice for the quality of food .

 there are plenty of restaurants in the area as well, including fast food joints and two small, ish supermarkets .

 they also have a great room service menu and was surprised at the big portions and quality of the food, great to get a bit in your room after a night on the town .

 breakfast equally tired ,  although a reasonable selection of food, general ambience in restaurant more like a youth hostel .

 the breakfast buffet full english breakfast was fantastic with a very good selection of food .

really nice hotel for buissnessnot much around in terms of shoppin etcfood was ok

everything about this hotel was first class including the food !

 the nicest surprise was how fantastic the food was which i hadn't expected in a large chain hotel .

 it is very convenient to the gloucester road tube stop, grocery store, drug store and fast food places .

 i ordered room service one night, and the food was delightful, and the service was fast and friendly .

 the location is just around the corner from the tube, boots and waitrose   right next door, close to many restaurants including fast food if you like .

 talking about food, something worth noticing is that there was a fridge in the room, but it was completely reserved for the mini, bar service beverages, which completely filled it .

 there was a massive queue for the restaurant, the food was beginning to run low we went down at 9 .

 there were italian, indian, british, american fast food, and thai restaurants very close to the hotel on cromwell   gloucester rds .

room service is expensive but good, the food was delivered hot and was tasty but was chosen from the current uninspired holiday inn room service menu, when i ordered a £6 .

   you could buy food from sainsburys or waitrose which were 2 minutes away to save money .

 food drink a little pricey in local establishments .

95 if you want hot food as well .

 note that all around the hotel are decent little cafes and shops to get either full breakfasts or breakfast foods .

 we ate on evening once at the garfunkels pub in the mall, it was typical chain restaurant food but fast with good service .

 there was an adequate self service buffet, not a huge selection or very well presented, cloths were not changed when food got spilt .

 not exactly what most tourists are looking for but when you have been out of the states as long as we have you eat fast food when you get the chance !

 there is no mini, fridge in standard rooms, so you can't store any food ,  the hotel used to have mini, fridges .

 poor customer service, bad and overpriced pub food .

there is a grocery store close by that you can pick up food and a starbucks nearby .

 as mentioned, there are several places to buy food if you're going cheap :

the hotel is just a couple of minutes walk from the nearest tube station and also has a waitrose , tesco and various fast food joints and restaurants nearby .

 shame that we had to use the forum restaurant this morning prior to check out ,  this restaurant is on the first floor and is one of the buffet style breakfasts so lukewarm food and very busy .

the food is very, very good   and the staff were very friendly .

 the hotel itself was very pleasant ,  the staff friendly and helpful and i can only comment on the breakfasts as this was the only meal that we had there ,  the food was excellent with a wide variety of choice .

 the food was excellent, the service was very friendly and the prices cheap .

 the food is excellent and the service great .

 the bar food actually looked pretty inviting as it passed by .

 if you like indian food we ate at the dehli brassiere it was exellent and more reasonably priced .

 i would recommendeating out as the evening food is frozen re, heat type and for the price you are paying it is not simply worth it .

 you can buy drinks and breakfast food at a waitrose supermarket and tesso express mart next door .

 the area has a few pubs, a couple of steak places, a number of indian restaurants and some fast food, so it's convenient for that .

 within 200 yards of leaving the hotel and heading to the tube station   you have a number of fast food outlets, highstreet restautants, pastry shops and supermarkets, so if you did wish to live in your hotel room for the duration of your stay, you could do !

 as for the continental breakfast taste was good but became boring after the 3rd day the food served wasnt changed .

we ate in the bistro downstairs and the food was very good ,  although the portions varied significantly depending on the chef that night .

 the buffet breakfast is ok although not the best i've had and usually includes a selection of fresh fruit as well as the usual 'full english' the food in the ground floor restaurant is good  i haven't had problems with room service although the menu has recently changed and doesn't have as good a selection as it did .

 when the food arrive   it was the wrong order .

 i can also tell you that there is nothing fantastic about the food .

 while travelling out of london to any of the popular destinations, food can be pretty expensive .

 the rooms have never disappointed and the food is always nice .

 breakfast was ok, great choice, but the cooked food was a bit tepid .

 the area is really safe with great food, boots, tesco, waitrose   burger king, kfc and starbucks .

additionally, they recommended the cafe forum which was about two blocks from the hotel for breakfast, the prices were reasonable and food was excellent .

00, good quality food, lots of choice, continental, full english, hot and fresh, very friendly staffs .

 there is 24 hour room service, a restaurant, and a tavern in the hotel although we did not sample the hotel food .

 many hotels i have stayed in the food has been rarely hot .

 the bed was very comfortable, and the empty refrigerator was a great place to store food and beverages .

 within easy reach you have all you could want peaceful areas and shops and food outlets .

 i can't comment on any of the hotel restaurants or food as we never ate there with so many other choices nearby .

 avoid the food in the hotel restaurant as it is ridiculously overpriced .

 also there is a nice bistro around the corner with very good food that is moderately priced .

the food here is great, we had breakfast brought to our room, although pricy well worth it .

 minimall with boots pharmacy, whole foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .

would not recommend the patisserie food looked overpriced, pastries were dry !

 food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .

there are a variety of priced places to eat in the immediate area, but the food costs are always high,  we ate mostly at pubs, where the beer and scotch were very reasonably priced always !

 more than enough food choices with coffee or tea, juice, pastries, toast, yogurt, cereal and assorted cold cuts to please every taste .

 another good thing is that the rooms have mini, fridges and it's great for storing ready, to, eat food from waitrose .

 they mark down their food at the end of the day and you can get great deals on everything from sandwhiches to desserts at a fraction of the cost .

the food in the restaurant is terrible .

 both of these offer good variety of good food at very reasonable prices and suitable for children .

 the glouster road tube station is just two minutes away, along with other food stores, pubs, internet cafes, restaurants etc .

 its a chain but the food was cheap and delicious !

 stunning food, amazing service .

 we didn't eat at the hotel ,  there were some great cafe's just around the block with great food at a much better price .

 if you're a family vacation traveller, you'll probably make use of the grocery store often becuse food in london is expensive when you consider the terrible usd, gpb exchange rate .

 many restaurants in the neighborhood, ranging from swanky to fast food to haute cuisine .

 there are coffee and pastry shops around the corner and fast food .

 there is also a grocery store in a shopping plaza on the corner where you can buy take out food, wine, etc .

 it was in a fantastic position, one block to the gloucester road tube station    there's a supermarket and fast food shops, as well as other shops nearby and opposite the station .

 but it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .

 food was ok, service very haphazard .

 the range of food available would have satirfied anyone, all well cooked and efficiently replenished .

i didn't sample any of the food options but there are several outlets just around the hotel .

the huge coffe bar in the lobby is quite nice and offers drinks and food at good prices .

 the delhi brasserie restaurant recommended by the hotel's concierge was a short walk, the food delicious and reasonable .

 the food was good and the service was very good .

 additionally, there are numerous restaurants everywhere ranging from fast food to upscale .

 there was also a more expensive english breakfast with many hot foods which was included in some room prices .

 the frig doesn’t keep items cold enough for food safety – it’s merely to slightly chill .

the waitrose market sells yummy food .

i want close proximity to tube station, starbucks, and food .

 food was expensive, but that is true all over london just now .

 the waitrose supermarket has many take out food options .

another reviewer mentioned the smell of food on the 25th floor .

 very convenient, but don't stay on that floor as the smell of heating food wafts down the corridor .

 the best food deal in this area is the local grocery store down the street ,  get your breakfast and lunch here and dine out nightly .

 one block from the tube, half a block from a nice grocery store for essentials like bottled water, snacks and takeaway prepared food, tissues, etc .

 food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .

the food in their pub as far as sandwiches etc, was reasonable .

 food in pub is excellent value .

 all the 4 nights we stayed there we relished the hot indian food takeout from the waitrose grocery chain, which is just around the corner .

 really good indian food is just a few blocks away .

there is an internet cafe, laundramat and sainsbury grocery store to the left up cromwell road and fast food, banks   and post offices to the right down cromwell road .

 it is in a nice neighborhood with fast food, resturants, and shopping with in walking distance .

 because it has sensor to count how many times you open it for beverage service, nice area, near starbucks, pastry shops, fast foods, supermarket, walking distances to kensington palace, london natural science museum, harrods, victoria albert musuem, pubs, and what else could you ask for .

 the food was delicious in both the consortia and forum restaurants in the hotel .
