Pros:. 1). Design is sleaker, sexier, and more efficient to functionality. 2). Runs silently, especially when you install the game to the HDD. 3). No problems with overheating. 4). So far no freezing or errors. 5). Massive 250GB HDD. 5). Well worth $299.99. 
Cons:. 1). Doesn't come with Component or HDMI cables (Although it does have an HDMI port). 2). It wasn't sold in 2006.. 
Summary:. The sleaker and sexier design makes the new 360 much more appealing than the older models by far. Not only is this a boost to aesthetics, but it is also more efficient with airflow design improvements and touch buttons. Both a vast improvement from previous models, especially original core/pro models. It runs quietly, more so if you opt to install your game to the massive 250GB HDD. There have not been any tell-tale signs of a faulty system, such as freezing, overheating, glitching, erros messages, so far. I purchased the S 250GB in a holiday bundle package (the only one available at gamestop) which came with a brand new mic and a copy of forza 3. Definately worth the $299. If you have an older model of the 360, I definately recommend trading it in for $70 today. The HDD is an additional $10, and your network adaptor will yield another $20. Throw in a couple of games to trade in and you can get the system for nearly half price.. Bottom line: Pick up this xbox. You will be much happier after trading in your old system for this upgraded beauty..

Pros:. Built-in WiFi, much quieter, bigger hard drive, OOOH SHINY!. 
Cons:. 300 bucks!!!. 
Summary:. It is nice to have an xbox that comes with the wifi built in. The 250gb drive is nice too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet during movies, internal wifi is awesome, netflix works great with it!. 
Cons:. The only problem that I have found is that if you have cats, and they jump up to your Xbox, they can open the tray during a game and that sucks!. 
Summary:. Would buy again in a heartbeat!. 

$$;
Pros:. I you watch Netflix thru the xbox, it is much quieter and cooler for longer run times. Looks slick with it's piano black case.. 
Cons:. Touch sensitive buttons can be a bit annoying.. 
Summary:. Overall it's great... 

$$;
Pros:. The console is nearly silent when running, comes with a 250GB hard drive, touch sensor buttons are a neat addition, built-in wireless, much smaller, and has more vents for cooling. The hard drive is protected instead of sitting on top of the console.. 
Cons:. Doesn't come with any HD cord. 
Summary:. This is how the 360 should have been done the first time around. It functions perfectly, runs quiet, is fast and is able to cool much more efficiently. The 250GB hard drive keeps me from worrying about taking up too much space.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nicely designed,NO MORE OVERHEATING, less noise, no RROD....and of course the supremacy of Xbox LIVE will continue!. 
Cons:. HDMI cable, where are you?. 
Summary:. Awesome upgrade, if for no other reason than the RROD and Overheat issues are gone. That's more than enough...can't wait to see how Kinect turns out.. Also, the quality of gamer is much higher on Xbox LIVE than I have encountered on PS Network...haven't played online on the Wii. To me, paying for it keeps the gamer caliber and manners at a level of goodness that is quite satisfactory. I'm more than happy to fork out the cash to keep 360 online play less cluttered and quality oriented.. 

$$;
Pros:. it has built in 802.11n wifi, 250gb hd, no RROD,Looks much better than any other xbox console to date, touch buttons, its quieter,smaller, and it produces less heat. 
Cons:. does'nt come with hd component cable or hdmi, The black gloss finish makes it easier to see fingerprints and dust. 
Summary:. This console is a great upgrade. 

$$;
Pros:. the Wi Fi its great with my N router when i play on my surround sound downstairs or in my room i direct connect.. 
Cons:. its quite... 
Summary:. Haven't found any at the moment..... 

$$;
Pros:. Great hard drive. Glad no blue-ray it is a gaming system. Very quiet. Kinect ready. Affordable price. Don't believe lies Microsoft installed an auto shut off button in case of over heating. A++. 
Cons:. A bit sensitive.. 
Summary:. I am so sick of Sony fan boys making up lies. Coming from a former member of SCA gamer advisory panel I know what I am talking about. Yea it does not have Blue-Ray. But if you only knew how many friends i have that bought a PS3 and regret doing so. The games with the exception of a few are crap. Their online service is buggy and glitchy as all hell. So easy to hack into service and cheat. Yes you pay for xbox live but I love that feature. Hardly any little kiddies messing up your games and cussing. But if you ever experience it Microsoft put in a mute option. Plus there frequently working to improve there great service. I love hearing about the xbox 360 RRD yet nothing about how the PS breaks and constant disc read errors. I had 9 yes 9 PS2 all different models and constant errors. If it wasn't for them breaking it was unable to read disc over and over again. So in summery. This new xbox 360 is a bargain of a deal with or without the trade in outlets. So many new ports and wifi integration. Of course cant put vertical but ask any game store attendant that knows what there doing. If you put any console vertical it will scratch the disc. So why they make them stands never know. So game easy and without a doubt pick up this great new xbox 360 slim system.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Super quiet 2. Smaller vs. old 360 3. Wifi included 4. faster loading time.. 
Cons:. None so far, found the last unit @ Bestbuy - checked www.bestbuy.com the evening before and was @ the store 10am the following day.. 
Summary:. Worth the upgrade, but don't buy from Gamestop. THeir "Trade-in" promo is a scam. Was told that it ended 2 days ago, but no where in the store were their signs or notices explaining that the program had ended. However on Gamestop.com - says offer expires on 7-18-2010.. 

$$;
Pros:. the 250GB hardive built in wifi much sexier and less problems with over heating. 
Cons:. that it collects fingure prints and the fact that its possible to scrach your disk if moved while disk is spining. 
Summary:. for the most part i like the new 360 and will most likely be buying one. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge Hard Drive, All new design, WI-Fi, Super Quiet, Touch Sensitive, More USB Ports. 
Cons:. Doesn't include transfer cable. 
Summary:. This is by far the best console made by Microsoft. I don't hear a peep from the console the the volume is turned on. The only problem for me was that i need to buy a separate cable to transfer. It is the ultimate console for gaming at the moment. Why waste 50 extra dollars for 250gb PS3 when nowadays, you can even get a blu ray player for less than that. It is a much better 360.. P.S. Don't listen to the jealous PS3 fanboys in the reviews who give this amazing console half a star even though they didn't buy it.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDMI, extra USB 2.0 connections, optical audio out, 802.11N wireless, 17% smaller, quiet, small power supply, sleek black finish, Microsoft Kinect ready, a whopping 250GB hard drive, all for $299.99.. 
Cons:. No bluetooth connectivity for external devices. Would have enjoyed seeing the option to hook up an Xbox 360 via headphone jack (1/8" output).. 
Summary:. Microsoft unveiled the redesigned Xbox 360 as the Xbox 360 Slim at E3 2010 in Los Angeles. The pros will point out many of the new additions found on this Slim model. The addition of the 250GB hard drive and the integrated 802.11N wireless are the biggest add ons, while the smaller packaging and extra ports for audio, video, and device connection round up the subtle differences.. It's not ground breaking, but it is refined and sexy. It's what the Xbox 360 should be. All for the SAME price as the current Xbox 360 Elite console. Why is this big? More bang for your buck. The only thing I could have seen Microsoft adding in addition would be headphone audio out (1/8" audio to hook up to computer speakers) and perhaps blue tooth connectivity for wireless devices to sync up with the Xbox 360. Yes, this would create extra work and likely would make it harder for them to sell it @ $299.99. But if they did keep the price, everyone would be raving and throwing up 5 stars.. Another item worthy of mention is that Microsoft claims they've solved the red ring of death issue that plagued around 5%-10% of their consoles released in the console's first 3 year lifespan. This will be very attractive to current Xbox 360 owners and likely entice them to upgrade should they have the cash to do so. Again, this isn't amazing new technology, but it's usually the little things that make a console great. That said, Microsoft has a great console and it looks like we'll have at least 2 years before Microsoft decides to announce the Xbox 360's predecessor. So why not invest and pick on of these up for yourself? For $299.99, it's a pretty good buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. absolutely everything. 
Cons:. not a single thing.

$$;
Pros:. I still have premium, elite version but this is one of the best console. It's more stylish, compact, quite, and built in wifi. This console is an must have even if you own a xbox 360 already trust me you love it!. 
Cons:. Blue Ray drive, Should been called 720 or something, But overall this is an great console!. 
Summary:. The best looking console in my collection!. 

$$;
Pros:. Silent, sleek, awesome!. 
Cons:. Price, need transfer cable. 
Summary:. Great update.. thanks microsoft (thought you guys were dead because of apple hehe).. 

$$;
Pros:. New Sleek design, Wireless built in, super quiet. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. The first slim I bought lasted about 20 sec. and came up with an error code E68 with the red led. So I took it back and exchanged it for a new one. So far It has been doing great. The size is actually a little smaller than the original but not by much. It super quite and does everything the other does. I really like the finger print buttons that operate the power and disc reader. Every system has a problem here and there so don't let my comment dissuade you from purchasing this system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quieter, built in WiFi, Kinect ready, no more overheating, no more RROD, smaller power supply. 
Cons:. Fingerprint magnet, ugly?, no blu-ray drive, seems to blow out more heat, there is a fan on the power supply that makes a slight buzz.. 
Summary:. This is truly what the Xbox 360 should have been. First of all don't let the "slim" fool you, it's not noticeably smaller than the first (unlike the PS3 slim) unless held side by side so don't let size be a factor. Where it wins points is with it's MUCH quieter operation (even more quiet if you install to the HDD), built in WiFi (a/b/g/n, that's faster than the PS3 one if you have a router that support wireless N), smaller power supply (mo more "brick") and more reliable (MS claims to have eliminated overheating and the RROD, so far mine has not had one issue). I also have to give Microsoft credit for not following Sony?s example and ADDING features instead of removing features.. Really the only complaint is a lack of a good media experience outside gaming (something they never promised in the first place though). I suppose if you want an all in one entertainment system, the PS3 is still the way to go. The 360 doesn?t do a good job at being a media center (poor interface, overpriced movie rentals that use ?points?, no Blu-Ray), instead it focuses on being a gaming console first. And of course the new Xbox carries all the benefits of the old (Live and the best game selection).. Despite the improvements, if you already have a working 360 I wouldn?t bother buying the upgrade yet. Chances are if you use WiFi you already purchased the ad-on, and if yours hasn?t overheated or RROD than it doesn?t matter if the new one is less likely too does it?. Basically my suggestion is this. If you can afford it get a PS3 and 360 to get the best of both worlds, if you can only afford one get the 360 slim. You won?t regret it if you enjoy gaming at all.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quiet, very nice design for the Xbox 360, large hard drive so you dont have to worry about space issues, does not overheat at all.. 
Cons:. No HDMI cable included with the package. 
Summary:. I have personally been a sony fan since the playstation 1, but it wasn't until the first Xbox came out which got me into playing Halo 2, ever since I have gotten that, I have been a Microsoft fan. I have purchased the Xbox 360 pro when i first came out, I have been in love with it, i had a couple of errors which i will admit, was not easy, escpecially to be away from a gaming system for a month. My dad has picked up a PS3 and it was great, but the online was terrible compared to what Xbox 360 has. I'm not an Xbox 360 fanboy, cause i do enjoy being on both systems, but I enjoy Xbox 360 gaming a lot more than PS3. At E3 when Microsoft announced the new Xbox 360, I thought it was a must have, especially because my Xbox was nearly 5 years old and didn't even have a jasper chip. I'm actually glad that Microsoft didn't include a Blu-ray player with the new Xbox 360 because Xbox is a gaming system, unlike the PS3 which is an enternainment system which focuses on other areas rather than gaming. The new Xbox 360 was completely silent and was a very fast system compared to what the Xbox 360 pro was, and is Kinect ready so that is a future advantage over the old Xbox 360. Also i didn't see any reviews here mention the new Xbox 360 includes a port for a kegningston lock which is usful in some cases like if you go on vacation or if you are away at your house for any reason, your xbox is secured with a new lock. Also the new Xbox 360 includes built in WiFi which is a huge update Microsoft should've included with the Xbox a very long time ago. Overall this system is amazing and is a big update for people who have old Xbox 360 without a jasper chip. I updated and i am totally pleased with this buy. The price is a little high but it will be worth it in the future... 

$$;
Pros:. Its very stylish.. 
Cons:. It gets hot!. 
Summary:. I would buy it and play video games all day if I could.. 

$$;
Pros:. (Got the system free by going here http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-get-anything-for-free/) built in wifi,nice smooth design,quieter.. 
Cons:. No HD cable included,nothing all that new except some fixes with the manufactoring,. 
Summary:. I am very happy about getting the new slimer 360 especially since i got it free..... it is by far the best system out there and now i dont have to worry about getting errors and problems like to R.R.O.D so It would be a good purchase if you still have the original xbox 360. 

$$;
Pros:. Newer, quieter, good looking, HDMI port, new style controller, one-touch, wifi, big hard drive (250GB), 5 USB ports.. 
Cons:. Still no Blu-Ray, comes with composite cables (really, its 2010 dude), M$ got real greedy on this console.. 
Summary:. I bought the new 360 about 4 days ago. I got it because my old Xbox 360 kept overheating and I wanted a HDMI port on the 360 (it was an old one). I bought the old wifi adapter for my old 360 so having wifi on the Slim wasn't new to me. It has a BIG hard drive so I can buy full games from XBL. The design looks way cool. (It catches fingerprints very easy, but really, we should be worring about air pollution rather than that.) Micro$ got real greedy on this system. It came with no HDMI cable nor component cable, just regular red, white, yellow cables- its the 21st century. (luckily I kept my old component cables) I dont know why they havent put a blu-ray player on it. I don't care about Kinect but it comes with the enabled port. But overall I would recommend the Slim to whosever Xbox 360 goes out, this is the one to get.. 

$$;
Pros:. + smaller, sleeker, quieter. + more ventilation, bigger fan. + integrated Wireless. + 250 GB hard drive. + Cool touch-sensitve buttons. + Runs great, wireless works great. + Xbox Live beats the crap out of PSN. + Kinect ready (if you're into that). 
Cons:. - $300 price tag (Microsoft, we deserve a break). - No HDMI cable included...seriously. - Headset is certainly not one-size-fits all, but easily replaced. - No included play and charge. - Have to buy extra cable to transfer old hard drive data. 
Summary:. Overall, this things awesome. I used to have an Xbox 360 elite, but after about 2 years, it red-ringed on me, and I hocked it for a PS3 after I got it fixed. The PS3 was cool, but the online multiplayer was simply weighed, measured, and found extremely wanting. I swore, however, I'd never go back to the xbox after the hardware failure fiascos. I did. The PS3 just didn't do it for me, yeah, its got cool stuff and Blue Ray (which is the ONLY reason I still have it) but the Xbox, with Xbox live, had multiplayer down to a science, no more of a theology. It still has it. And its just as much fun now as ever, except maybe more. The new Xbox is basically the same thing, just improved. It's the one we all wish would have come out first, instead of 5 years after initial release. A lot of people say that there aren't enough differences to warrant buying it if you already own one. That is an understandable arguement, however, this thing has all new hardware inside, that's not supposed to overheat like the old ones (time will tell though). The integrated WiFi works great, and it is certainly quieter, as promised. I wish it would have come with an HDMI cable or some other free stuff. Overall though, it's better than expected and Microsoft certainly knows what the people want, and they deliver. Unlike Sony...still no cross-game chat...sigh.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the fact that it has better airflow inside reducing the chance of overheating. system designed to shut down before overheating like it did with the RRoD. Big hard drive comes standard and the built in wi-fi is convenient. 
Cons:. so far, no cons. some people say that if you move the unit while the disc is spinning that it will destroy the disc, luckily, I haven't had to find out that the hard way. 
Summary:. for someone that has the older xbox 360 with a hard drive, and a wi-fi network adapter, there really is no need to upgrade. however, if you've been burned by the RRoD, or you have a bare bones arcade system and you're looking to upgrade, and you can afford it, why not try this? after all, xbox live is WAY better than the PS network and has much better games.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Wifi. -250GB hard drive. -smaller than the Xbox 360. -sleek design. -plays orignal Xbox 360 games. -Kinect. 
Cons:. -Xbox LIVE still costs money. -Fingerprint magnet.. -DVD. -Almost same controllers. 
Summary:. Ive been a gamer since I was 4 no game systems really had the BOOM effect. Until E3 when they announced this.. 

$$;
Pros:. wifi, silent running(still loud disc read), seems to run smoother, slim sleek design. 
Cons:. still loud disc read, no blu ray, touchy touch buttons. 
Summary:. it seems that the slim runs smoother to me, I had the final fantasy XIII edition of the 360 and returned that to best buy for the slim, and it seems like it's a bit smoother then the final fantasy 360 but it could just be me, I will have to see if my 360 gets over heated or the red ring of death but I am hoping for no troubles as such, hopefully I won't have to deal with that but the touch is a bit touchy, it can turn off if you get too close to the power area, I do really like the fact that it's got the built in wifi so I don't have to pay another 70 bucks to use xbox live wirelessly, I think it is worth the 299 but would be perfect if it had blu ray, I really want to see if kinect is what microsoft is saying it's going to be, we'll have to see.... 

$$;
Pros:. - Integrated Wifi. - Modern, Sleek shape form. - 250gb Hard Drive. - HD Netflix, Zune, ESPN. - Optical Audio, HDMI. 
Cons:. - DVD.... - RCA cables... C'MON it's 2010. - Fingerprint Magnet. - XBOX Live costs money. 
Summary:. I've been a gamer since I first played Afterburner in my Sega Master System, I was 3 years old. Since then I've tried to own every console that comes out and that make sense to buy.. The Xbox 360 was not a console that made sense buying up until this model. Not having integrated WiFi up until 2010 is a big drawback, owning a Wii and a PS3 I wasn't willing to drag an ethernet cable all through my living room just to play on the Xbox. To my surprise the WiFi is also really fast compared to the PS3s (specially when downloading updates). 250GB Hard Drive should cover all my media needs, even though I have a 2TB HTPC right next to it and making the Hard Drive propietary, is still a ripoff. As other reviews have said, the console is very quiet, sleek and has great power savings.. The Dashboard experience feels like a perfect balance between the Wii's childish approach and the PS3's Manly-Glossy approach. I own a Roku, HTPC, Wii and a PS3, I've tried the Netflix experience through all of them and the Xbox 360 solution is the best one. It was the fastest, sleekest and with WiFi 802.11n you will be able to watch all your videos in pure (erm, compressed, streamed) HD. I'm really looking forward to watch ESPN videos as well.. Even though I will pay for Xbox live, I'm not sure if it's something we "should" be paying for. I'm all for having a premium model but don't limit a game's capabilities just because of that. Having to pay full price for the games, paying for your console and paying for my internet connection should be more than enough for me to be able to play multiplayer games. You are hosting the games on my console anyways.. All being said and done, if you have been waiting for the right time to buy an Xbox, this is it. If you own a PS3 you might still not see the point, personally the only games I got were Gears of War 1 and 2 and I'm not sure I want anything else for now. If you already own an Xbox, I say pick this one up when yours RROD' again :P. Cheers!. 

$$;
Pros:. 1-it's smaller than that one. 2-it has 250GB hard disc. 3-it has a beautiful design. 4-has useful port. 
Cons:. 1-after long play it gonna hot. 
Summary:. I like consul but i like xbox 360 because it has kinect. 

$$;
Pros:. Runs extremely cool and low noise. 
Cons:. I had a major problem that basically meant that I could not connect to My WIFI. I have found more on the Issue here. http://gamerworld.my1.ru/blog/wifi_issues_for_new_xbox360_slim/2010-07-16-25. 

$$;
Pros:. I purchased this system the day it was released at the gamestop near my house, great buy. Touch functions on the device work great if not to well. Quieter, slimmer and prettier. Kinect Ready!!. 
Cons:. It's not really worth the 300 unless you're trading in your Pro or Elite system, I did this and got about $175 off of it. I will be buying Kinect so I just went ahead and bought this one. It has an internal hard drive so no borrowing a friends D:. 
Summary:. Great product but if you're old system is working fine and you have no interest in purchasing Kinect, don't buy. Otherwsise great product :D Huge hard-drive!. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek/slim design,very quite, plenty of memory, price is right, touch control is nice, finish gives it a very hi tech look to match the rest of my A/V equipment, built in wireless-is fast and easy to find your network. Did I mention how quite it was. 
Cons:. none so far, except it should of been released 2 years ago. 
Summary:. Very quite and ez to look at matches my other equipment. Price is right for all the features-the best 360 so far and I have owned the original,. 360 and 360 Elite. If you are considering this even though you own a Elite, go for it.. Updated. on Jun 24, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. In a nutshell the pros are the 260GB hard drive, built in Wifi,Kinect Ready, much quieter system and it is smaller than the previous versions. The change to the shiny black finish is also a plus as it matches the rest of my audio/visual setup.. 
Cons:. Still have half the size of the original brick for the power supply. It will take all fingerprints. No blue-ray and no HDMI cable added for the $299 price.. 
Summary:. I am pleased to have upgraded to the system. It is truly whisper quiet. Tranferring data from the old system to the new system was a breeze with the transfer cable that may take you back another $20. However, this is the system to get even if it will only be around for another 2-3 years. Still the smaller system also allows you to grow your hard drive space if needed, but 260 gigs is more than enough space. MS needs to add the HDMI cable as part of the package. I am guessing that HDMI cable will become standard in the future and they should look at the possibility of adding Blue-Ray even though the system plays dvds well. If you have the finance or have another system to trade in you should do it now before the trade-ins at EBgames ends in another week or so. Reserve your copy today because you cannot find these systems in any store by just walking in and asking. Overall I am pleased to see that MS has finally begun to listen to hardcore gamers such as myself.. 

$$;
Pros:. Built in wifi finally microsoft have entered 2010. They claim that hardware failure is about the same as the ps3's now.. 250gb hard drive awesome.. I have a ps3 slim and this is so good I am going to trade it in for this xbox 360 slim. 
Cons:. Well from what I have heard people are saying that it damages disks but come on people you have a 250gb hard drive use your common sense and realise that with that much space install your games to your hard drive.. 
Summary:. Looks extremely nice better looking than the ps3 now In my opinion. It makes the ps3 slim look very cheap. Only problem is that I had an xbox pro 60gb for 18 months and it started to look like it was going to get red ring of death but never did so I jumped ship and bought a ps3 slim which is a good console but i don't think it is good enough for a hardcore gamer like me. The online is just not good enough and as for graphics yes uncharted 2 is nice but every other game is terrible compared to 360 so to sum this up it looks like a great buy I will post another review when I get mine just to confirm it's greatness but for now I can only wait because it's not released in europe until July 16th.. 

$$;
Pros:. The difference in noise and heat alone are worth the upgrade. The 250GB hard drive is also nice (I had the original 20GB version of the first 360).. 
Cons:. No HD connectivity (READ HDMI or HD component cable) out of the box is ridiculous. There is no WOW factor. You think to yourself, "I just spent how much for the exact same functionality?" Granted the Kinect compatibility will be a future benefit.... 
Summary:. Overall, a good buy especially if you can get the trade-in specials offered by several retailers currently. I paid less than $125 for mine by trading in a controller, original XBox 360, Hard Drive, and Wireless Adapter. I'm assuming that the kit for Kinect compatibility would be at least half of that. Here's hoping to no hardware issues!! (*cough, cough* right...). 

$$;
Pros:. Built-in Wi-fi and a 250gb HDD, smaller, lighter, quieter and much prettier than the old gray block, Netflix is a dream on the 360 and is lots of fun to watch with your friends.. 
Cons:. Heats up like crazy, Live is $50 ($60 in Nov) when the PS3's PSN doesn't charge.. 
Summary:. Let me just start by saying that this is my 3rd Xbox in 3 years. Why do I keep coming back?? It's the games, that's why. But honestly, a guy can only take so much abuse...if this one fails, I'm just going to stick to my trusty PS3 which has never gone down in the 4 years I've had it. I love the 360. It's an excellent system with strong, sturdy online support and really fun games (L4D anybody?).. I was surprised the S is only 17% smaller than the original model. It seem smaller, believe it or not. The shiny black coating makes it look much more sleek and comparable to the PS3's beauty. The system does tend to create high heat so make sure to keep it in a very well ventilated area. Having it on for an hour creates crazy heat, so you can imagine having a Halo marathon...yikes.... Overall, the new system does pack a nice 250gb HDD punch and the Wi-Fi is much needed, particularly when the PS3 already had built in HDD and Wi-Fi from the get-go. I don't like the fact that I have to pay for online play but the 360 does provide a solid, strong online experience rendering it worthy of my money. Microsoft does need to step up and man up...I still freak out sometimes not knowing if my 360 will turn off permanently like the times prior...only time will tell, I guess.. 

$$;
Pros:. -quiet. -built in wifi. -250GB memory. 
Cons:. -doesn't come with HD hookup. -only one controller and no game. -questionable quality control. 
Summary:. First unit purchased came with A BROKEN HARD DRIVE. Called xbox support and they arranged for a replacement hard drive - in 10 BUSINESS DAYS!!!. For my trouble, the lease they could do is FedEx a replacement. I ended up just taking the unit back to the store for a replacement. New unit works great - easy to hook up to internet. Unfortunately, with my luck so far, I'm keeping the number to xbox support handy.... 

$$;
Pros:. Prettier, quieter.. 
Cons:. Still can't transfer music with a USB drive?. 
Summary:. I still own an original XBox 360 and I'm still happy with it. While it may seem "petty" compared to the RROD, my biggest complaint has always been that the only way to transfer music to the 360 is to rip a CD into it (as opposed to a USB drive). Ripping CD's is slow, inconvenient and so 1999. I can't even remember the last time I purchased one. I know you can stream music, but I like the idea of custom sound tracks that some games allow you to use. C'mon Microsoft, come into the now!. 

$$;
Pros:. All of it is a upgrade to a already good product!. 
Cons:. Needs a blue ray and a upgraded hdmi!. 

$$;
Pros:. Cool design. Relatively quiet. Lots of hard drive space. Wifi. 
Cons:. Nudge it accidentally and you can say goodbye to your brand new $60 COD MW2. Fingerprints as well as smudges get on and do not come off. Looks like you've had it for years after a week (sitting in same spot, doesn't move anywhere). 
Summary:. I'm not saying this is a "horrible" system but it could be much much better. I recently got this never owning an Xbox before and I am very disappointed. I think I should have stuck with my Wii. I've had the wii for over 2 years with not a single problem. I don't know how this is compared to the previous versions since I have not used or owned any. Personally, it was a waste of money. I bough Call of Duty Modern Warfare too and had it for only a few days. I accidentally nudged the console while the game was in and it made a horrid noise. I took the game out and found massive deep scratches all around the disk. I tried a disk repair kit and even got it resurfaced which still did not help. I also am very upset with how it looks. There are fingerprints and smudges EVERYWHERE. My Xbox does not move! It stays in the same spot all day! How did these marks come about? Beats me! I tried cleaning it, didn't work. So overall I truly believe this was a complete waste of money and I should have just stuck with me wii..

Pros:. Built in WiFi. Smaller. Less noise. 
Cons:. Still has over heat issues and shuts down on you. Still eats discs if something moves the 360 while loading.. Still no blu ray drive. Still hard drives you must buy from Microsoft. 
Summary:. Even with their re-design it will over heat and eat your discs. I fear Microsoft will never get it right and is incapable of doing so.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wifi Buid in!!!! A+ for Microsoft!. 
Cons:. No Blue-ray yet!!!!. Old Hard Drive is not compatible!!!. No RCA Audio Out!!!. 
Summary:. Oh well i think the new design and the build in wifi are great!!! What i dont like its that it dosent play Blue-ray i think i would it be perfect if you guys add a blue-ray reader + an RCA or minijack Audio Output... separate somewhere in the console!!!. Keep it Microsoft your better that Sony anyways!!!. David Gomez. Sanger, CA. 

$$;
Pros:. its faster than the old xbox. 
Cons:. Microsoft copied every thing off the first generation PS3 !. 
Summary:. Stick with ypur old xbox people this is a wait of time and money !. 

$$;
Pros:. - it's looks neat + nice features i can live without.. 
Cons:. anything wrong with putting a cheap, free game with it, MS?. 
Summary:. i have an elite that red-ringed on me and was fixed (thanks, MS) and, you know what, i don't need this. i'm very happy with what i've got now and to spend another $300 on just a few new items just doesn't make sense to me. on top of that, paying another $150 for the really dumb kinect doesn't amount to a hill of beans for me also...people, you wanna move around while playing, go OUTSIDE and exercise!!! jumpa all you want, run, wave your arms to and from, but to move your body just like the avatar in your favorite video game just doesn't fly with me. i'll continue my button-mashing while seated, enjoying a beer or two and a snack (no, i am not a fat kid on my ass all day, just a tall, slim 50-yr. old who enjoys his gaming the normal way).. if you don't have a 360 yet, NOW is a good time to get THIS one, otherwise don't waste your $$$!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless, USB connector. 
Cons:. Reliability. 
Summary:. With regular cleaning etc, I managed to keep the first generation Xbox going until about three weeks ago. The RROD finally appeared and wouldn't clear so faced with the X clamp fix or buying a new one with wireless connection etc, I decided to pay for the slim. Yep, you guessed it - the red light came on within 24 hours and it's now in Germany awaiting repair. So at least 3 weeks without what I paid for - thanks Microsoft!. Having spoken to my local gaming shop, I'm not the first. Will I buy another? No. Can I recommend it? No.. 

$$;
Pros:. none, ok it does look like an alienware hard drive.. 
Cons:. everything! this plastic piece of crap is worthless! don't be fooled by the design! i hooked it up and it sounded like it was making coffee! i even recorded it to play for the microsoft idiots! returning it tomorrow!. 
Summary:. BUYER BEWARE! microsoft made this xbox so that they can sell it along with kinnect. they made the price $299, but in essence, if you get the kinnect, it will total $449! what a scam! do yourself a favor and keep the xbox you have! and spit on the xbox slim signs whenever you see them!.
