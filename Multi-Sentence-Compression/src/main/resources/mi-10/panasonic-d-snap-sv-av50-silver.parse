still works great .
00 -LRB- $ 229 .
00 with $ 100 rebate -RRB- .
just do not forget to download windows media encoder .
it produces grainy/dark images unless you are in bright sunlight .
picture and video are okay .
i got mine for $ 129 .
i bought this camera based on its vast amount of uses .
at 2mp the camera just isnt up to par .
the mp3 player is great .
