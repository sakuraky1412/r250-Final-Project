great , easily best android phone on at t and its weaknesses are easily overpowered by its strengths , also very goodd starter phone  .
(        .
i have the overseas , non at t version , so i have sideloading  .
the messages widget , battery widget and settings widgets from htc are incredibly handy (as well as the calendar and notes widgets , which are all free)  .
so far the android market place has been a slight let down , but i have all the news apps i need , as well as angry birds  .
hopefully it gets better , quickly .
it is just what i want in a smart phone not a power user .
i recently owned an iphone 3gs and my friend got the aria a few weeks later  .
i tried it out then fell in love  .
one of my favorite things is that i can get a free music app off the android market so that beats itunes  .
the camera takes better pictures than a cell phone has any right too  .
im even using it to wrote this review  .
get this phone if youre choosing between this or an iphone  .
android is too great to pass up .
if you are in the market for a new phone that does everything and is not a freakin brick this is the phone to get  .
the htc aria is an awesome phone for just about anyone  .
its packed with features and has a relatively low price tag  .
and it is possible to install third party apps and games from a computer , you just need the software from htc's website .
has all the features i want in an android phone , without the ridiculous size of some of the higher end models  .
i live in a house of iphones , and they are jealous .
the phone cannot be beat  .
it's phenomenal  .
i am disappointed at quality of offline gps apps available , but that is hardly a phone issue  .
if you are waiting for a usable , svelte android phone which feels more like a phone than a nerd device (nothing against nerd devices  .
) then your wait is over .
hands down , this phone is the most fun ive ever had with a phone  .
it's eazy to use and has plenty of free apps to keep you busy  .
there are 7 home screens that give you plenty of room for all your fav  .
apps , and widgets .
i strongly recomend this phone and extremely happy with the purchase  .
even thought att has blocked 3rd party apps , there are over 500 , 000 in the app market  .
i am pretty sure you wo not suffer .
this is my first android phone and i absolutely love it  .
the more i get familiar with this phone the more i love it  .
the camera is just absolutely stunning i feel its just as good as my 12mp digital camera  .
i have finally found the phone that i wo not be in hurry to get rid of  .
love it .
this phone is really incredible , they should have name this the htc incredible , but i love this phone and would reccomend it to any att memeber thinking of switching to verizon just to get a droid phone  .
this phone rivals any droid phone for verizon , i know , i do my research   )  .
i have an iphone 3g and contemplated upgrade to iphone4 and decided with go with this freebe via amazon  .
so glad we did that  .
small , light , portable , no case needed with the rubberized back , and extremely pocketable  .
no need to baby this thing and wrap around some $30 case  .
beautiful screen , and tons of apps  .
filled up my 7 home screens in two days  .
i now have about 30 apps  .
google voice search and navigation are particularly amazing  .
runs multiple apps at the same time  .
love it that i can talk and read emails and look up , type memos at the same time  .
this phone does everything for me , and just about runs my life  .
battery life is not bad at all if you have y5 installed  .
speaker volume is a little low , no worse than the iphone , and not a surprise with such a compact phone to those who complain about not being able to install off market apps  .
most of these apps are beta's  .
swype is no longer off market  .
i downloaded htc sync to have the ability to do it , but cannot actually find an off market app i want to install .
i is skeptical at first about the virtual keyboard since this is my first smartphone  .
i is ok with it since you can turn it sideways but even just after owning it a week i never turn it sideways and always type with the vertical smaller keyboard  .
the auto    correct is surprisingly accurate  .
i love the fact that it populates your contacts with facebook , i anticipated a long evening of transferring phone numbers from my previous phone , i only had to add a few people who don't have facebook  .
it is also easily tethered with a laptop if you do not have wifi available  .
no complaints , great compact phone , a t and t hit home with this one .
i switched to aria from iphone 3gs , and after one week i can say the choice is a wise one  .
same functionality , much better form factor  .
did not want the 4g , as it's practically the same phone no matter what the hype is    it changes nothing at all regarding some of the others' concerns battery life is great , better than the iphone , if you're willing to do a bit of housekeeping  .
get the advanced task killer , and after the phone had booted up , kill all the at t crapware that would usually sit in the background and drain your battery  .
if you're not using wifi/bluetooth/gps , just disable when not needed  .
i use the phone extensively with no battery life problems whatsoever regarding sideloading of the non    market apps you can root the device , and do whatever you want .
i got this phone the other day and it has been amazing  .
everything is pretty sweet  .
the sound quality of the music rivals that of my computer speakers (seriously)  .
can multitask quite easily (unlike apple who waited til 4th generation to understand)  .
android os plus the htc model equals a fantastic phone  .
i did not think att is capable of putting a real phone out there but it proved me wrong  .
compared to my old fuze this phone is a dream come true  .
i highly suggest this phone if you do not want an iphone or wish to have an android phone on att updated  .
on aug 6 , 2010  .
pretty much everything about this phone rocks  .
compact size is great for pockets , while 3  .
2in screen is big enough for anything i'd want it for  .
fits nicely in my hand and can get everywhere on the screen with my thumb  .
only minor drawback is no led flash , but no iphones had them until this week , so i angsted for weeks and is finally ready to buy a tmo n1 off craigslist or ebay and rock their 6mb hspa+ network  .
then that exact same weekend , out of the blue , att announces this phone  .
i checked it out on launch day and is seriously impressed  .
angsted over it for one night , then read about wirefly  .
com's totally free offer and    booyah    saved $500 and got a badass android phone with senseui not sure the 3rd party lock is completely accurate  .
htc's user manual with att branding all over it specifically describes loading 3rd party apps via htc sync over usb  .
so no to ota 3rd parties , but probably yes to usb 3rd party apps for handheld gaming , i'll be getting an ipod touch with savings from paying $0 for the phone updated  .
on jun 27 , 2010  .
great small phone if you want a phone with pda functions rather than the other way around  .
the stock keyboard and all variants i have tried are tight and close to useless  .
however , you can sideload swype and that makes it all good .
i have previously owned 2 blackberry pearls , 1 pearl flip , 1 8900 javelin , and 1 9700 bold  .
there is also an iphone somewhere in that mix that i returned within hours to get another blackberry  .
i switched to the aria because i needed a change in my life , and my 9700 bold had a bad web    browser  .
on the first day of ownership , i switched back to my 9700 six times because the blackberry had features i missed that all changed once i found the app store , and came to realization that this device is not supposed to be like my blackberry  .
now , after 2 weeks of ownership , i have grown to love this phone for it's fast loading speeds , and the amount of convenience at my fingertips  .
the texting takes some acclimating , but it really is not that bad  .
however , i wish i could say the same about the battery life  .
the battery lasts on a good day up to 18 hours  .
this does not even rival my blackberry's battery that lasted up to 7 days overall , i do see myself going back to a blackberry once they solve there internet browser issues , and email reformatting issues  .
however , this is a great phone to have for the time being and , i is wrong    android is a great operating system .
i recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smartphone without all the hassle and it is an overall great phone  .
my new unlocked phones is the best  .
without it i would be lost  .
my htc aria is amazing  .
being an unlocked at t phones i can take it overseas and my kids absolutely love the touchscreen , apps , and games  .
i'm definitely surprising my wife with one for her birthday  .
i got my htc unlock codes from unlockthatphone  .
com , they are amazing and fast to get cell phone unlockï¿½codes  .
if you ever need any at t unlock codes be sure to check them out .
i bought the aria just a month ago , coming from an iphone 3g  .
the aria is a much snappier phone than the 3g , although even the middle    of    road aria sports a much faster processor than the 3g  .
call quality is fine , at least as good or better than y previous iphone 3g  .
i like the smaller aria for its pocket    ability , the smaller screen is no real loss  .
i would like a front    facing camera , but that is still rare among android phones  .
the main app i use is epocrates , and it runs terrificly on the aria  .
i have no complaints and highly recommend the phone .
great    i highly recommend .
this phone is great anyone who rated under 3 stars your obviously not looking for a phone that does it all b/c this phone has and does it all  .
i am a business man which means i always need my emails and phone calls does all of that and more , it automatically sets my agenda up in my calendar so im always on task and i get calendar alerts  .
if your worried about the size if you have big hands do not be  .
i have huge hands i palm basketballs very easily and texting has never been a problem for me  .
did i mention i have this phone unlocked to use for my t    mobile service it's awesome t    mo needs a phone just like it in line    up asap  .
had the phone for over a week now  .
all i can say is i am very happy with my purchase  .
been waiting for a while now for an android phone on att  .
looked at the captivate but much prefer the sense ui from htc over samsung's touchwiz  .
a few key points    .
processor    although not a 1gz processor the aria has shown no lag whatsoever even when as many as 15 programs running  .
very impressed  physical size/build quality    the phone is built really well and feels solid in your hand even though it is quite small  screen size    okay not the 4+ inch display like many phones but it is plenty big for most uses  .
some websites don't shrink to fit the width but that is a minor issue  camera    no flash is disappointing but it takes pretty good pictures  .
there are different light settings which helps a bit  .
haven't taken any video yet  battery    the battery is not nearly the issue many make it out to be  .
is it great  .
is it on par with many of the phones being made today  .
yes  .
i can get through the day with a good amount of use  .
just get the advanced app killer and you will be fine  .
i have mine set to kill apps after 30 mins  keyboard    the portrait keyboard is small but the predictive text is very good  .
i have large fingers and in 2 days i have only sent a couple of texts (out of over 400) with mispelled words  .
landscape keyboard is pretty good and the voice to text works really well  .
every now and again (probably 6 times of 1500+ texts) the keyboard freezes and forces you to close  .
you can still send message though  .
seems a small bug with predictive text  .
simply close and re    open messaging and all is good again  speaker volume    another complaint by many that i have had no issue with  .
it is a bit tinny but it is plenty loud  .
you can adjust the phone ringer volume as well as media volume  .
adjusting the media volume helped quite a bit when playing a song as a ring tone  email    i have my work and 3 personal emails synced to the phone  .
not an issue to speak of  syncing facebook    not able to get my facebook contacts to sync with the phone  .
really just wanted it because an easy way to get pix added to contacts  .
this is really the only issue with the phone i have had again , overall i am very happy with this purchase  .
many will say it cannot compete with the higher end phones coming out but i think it definitely holds its own  .
if you are looking for an android phone and do not have to follow the masses this is a great choice  .
the phone runs on android 2  .
1 after speaking to an htc rep they have almost completed testing on android 2  .
2 for the aria and look to have released early fall  .
as far as im concerned the phone does not even need it , it's great the way it is  .
but the 2  .
2 will allow you to store apps on the sd card which means the phone will give the iphone a run for it's money  .
htc blew apple out of the water years ago as far as im concerned .
the htc aria is a wonderful smartphone  .
it is literally the perfect size , making the iphones , blackberries , and droids of the world seem huge by comparison  .
although the specs may not be that impressive , the real life performance is not  .
it rarely stutters , and if it does its usually the network  .
i bought it recently and have had a few days to put it through its paces  .
the battery life is probably the only thing holding it back from being the perfect phone  .
it can barely get through a day  .
a day being 10am to 2am  .
the battery goes completely flat , and that is with good power management the htc sense offers a lot of wonderful widgets , a great keyboard , especially in the landscape mode , the 7 screens , and a variety of other small things that smarten up the interface  .
i will say that you should immediately get a new music player , i recommend doubletwist , and advanced task killer  .
since android lacks a default simple and user friendly programs for both i would recommend getting this phone  .
so far its the best phone i've had , having switched from a blackberry curve 8310 , and to that from the sony ericsson w760a  .
its stylish , elegant , portable , fast , and ultimately useful  .
if you hate apple and are on at t , spring for this over the captivate and any of the other smartphones  .
it has all the right ingredients , minus the battery issue , but thats common for a lot of smartphones  .
now to wait for the froyo update .
this is my first android phone and after doing a lot of research i noticed that it never gets a bad review but it is way cheaper than the superphones like the evo 4g and droidx  .
i needed 4 smartphones for myself , my wife and 2 kids  .
any of the 1ghz phones would have been over $900 with contract  .
i got the 4 arias for $98  .
the small screen may not have big specs but it looks great  .
the phone feels fast  .
i love it and the kids love it  .
my daughter really wanted an iphone 4 but now she loves the aria  .
the battery life has been good for all 4 of us so far  .
my wife gets 2    3 days out of hers while the always    online 14 year old daughter has to charge at the end of the night  .
the 5mp camera is great even without a flash  .
the video is ok but not nearly as good as the stills  .
it comes with a 2gb micro sd card so i will have to replace that but for the price i can understand why a larger card was not included  .
i did not like the small virtual keyboard at first but after 2    3 days i got used to it  .
in my opinion some android phones look and feel a bit clunky  .
this is not one of them  .
i am somewhat of an apple fanboy and is worried that i would have some buyer's remorse getting an aria instead of the iphone4  .
so far i am happy with the choice and have no regrets updated  .
on jul 30 , 2010  .
overall , htc hit the mark with this phone  .
it is not too bulky to fit nicely in your pocket , nor too small to be productive  .
don't let it's diminutive size fool you , consider it to be a humble pocket giant  .
both my husband and i tend to like windows mobile phones , however , this android has wormed its way into our hearts  .
there are a few quirks , as noted above , but the phone in its entirety is great  .
unlike my husband , i do not spend time looking for obscure applications from the web , so my only true con (no camera flash) can be easily resolved by gasp using my real camera  .
; ) he has not purchased the aria as of yet because he is waiting to see if htc wins his heart with a new (er) android/windows mobile super phone that may be coming out this fall/winter  .
he tends to prefer a phone with a keyboard (not sure if the htc android will ever have one)  .
also , some have complained about the screen size  .
switching over from the htc tilt , this was not much of a problem for me considering the aria is bigger  .
in all honesty the screen is a decent size (think back five years to your pda or flip phone) at any rate , do not be fooled into believing the innovative apple i    phone is a better device  .
far from it , actually  .
unlike the i    phone , with the aria , you can watch any video online  .
be it on the actual youtube site or a video that is embedded in an article  .
they post it , you watch it  .
ah yes and you can also manipulate your home screen to fit your personal style  .
call me ocd or not , but i know that seeing the numerous applications that show up all the time on the i    phone would make my eyes twitch  .
i prefer the clean home    screen with a date , time , internet etc advice   if you are interested in this wonderful phone (and you should be by now) i suggest you read up on it before purchasing it  .
i say this because i had a comical experience in    store with a representative that not only failed to know any of the answers to my questions , but she also said (on numerous occasions ) i do not know , but the i    phone does nothing else exist but that innovative , restricted , cult forming device  .
answer , yes  .
there are some fabulous alternatives that utilize the same technology smart intelligent people unite , buy the aria updated  .
on jul 6 , 2010  .
overall i believe that this phone is just as or better than the iphone  .
the widgets help break up the mundane  .
i would recommend this phone to anyone who is not willing to shell out the extra cash for a iphone 4 or is not looking for a iphone but would like to upgrade what they have .
i replaced my samsung impression with this phone  .
i had this phone for 5 days and i am loving it  .
although att crippled it , i is able to get some good android apps  .
could have gotten better if att did not lock phone  .
this phone is a keeper  .
if you are looking for a compact but fast phone , get the aria  .
if your fingers a big , texting might be difficult  .
the screen is small in size but the phones performance is very good .
i got the htc aria and it is by far the best alternative phone to the iphone on at t right now  .
it might not be the best android phone out there but i'm glad that at t finally got a real android phone on board .
great phone overall  .
i bought it the day it came out  .
at t is finally getting on the andriod bandwagon  .
updated  .
on jul 20 , 2010  .
this is my first (real) android phone for at t  .
started with an unlocked g1 , and that just gave me a taste for more  .
when best buy started their free friday phones on the first week of oct , they had the aria , so i decided to give it a try  .
glad i did been just under a month now , and i can honestly say that i love the aria  .
did the research on at t's removal of the ability to side    load apps  .
no big deal , downloaded the android central sideload wonder machine , and it works fine  .
only down    side (i guess) is that you need to 'usb' the aria to computer in order for it to work  .
it's a fine work    around as much as i love htc sence , as it's a better skin than that of moto    blur  .
i thought i would be fine with htc's regular keyboard , but ended up staying with better keyboard with the iphone skin over that  .
combine it with handcent sms , and you got one fine texting experience one thing i love on this is more android over ios  .
free apps , and that you can download them without inputting a password every single time  .
one , only one did i ever pay for an android app , mainly because i use widgetlocker alot more and the ad's started to bug me  .
you get much more functionality than the stock screen lock another android related thing is that it's running 2  .
just waiting (impatiantly) for 2  .
2 and it's flash and apps to sd card abilities back to the aria as a phone  .
reception is no worse or better , so it's a good thing  .
always got good reception almost everywhere with a few spots that i know it just wont work  .
still get 1 bar out of it for most that for most of those spots i get my usual ringtones and mp3 music out of it  .
not sure if it's me or the aria , sometimes i think it's too soft , sometimes it's way too loud  .
i guess i still have to mess around with the volume not going to get much into the battery  .
all my smart phones , 8125 , 8525 , treo 750 (all htc) all last about a day and have to recharge every night  .
so this is no different a lot of ppl are complaining about the screen size  .
yes , i'll give you that compared to evo or incredible  .
but remember a time when pda screens were 3  .
2 and that is considered big  .
to me , this is no different  .
at least i don't have to hassle with portability of the phone , and has just enough room for texting  .
going back to better keyboard with the iphone skin  .
so much better the 5  .
0mp camera is great with auto    focus  .
sharp and bright (good lighting)  .
it sucks that there is no flash on it , but then again  .
with any phone , better to get a real camera  .
for that quick picture and send to facebook , it gets what you need done well , hope that this helps  .
it's just my two cents with my aria , and i do not think you will go wrong with the phone either .
great , cool , reliable phone  .
extend battery life and it will be perfect .
so i'm test driving this phone  .
over all i do like it  .
i mostly picked it because i like the size  .
i always carry my phone in my pocket  .
so the smaller size is appealing  .
and for it's size , the processor is plenty fast for my uses a lot of the cons i listed have been listed multiple times by others  .
not wanting to be redundant , i still feel i need to be honest and list my experiences  .
the cramped size of the keyboard is expected  .
even though expected , it does take time to get used to and can be frustrating  .
the text prediction helps a ton  .
i found i misspell over half of the time because of the small keyboard  .
but the text prediction corrects it almost every time the real problem with the cramped keyboard is not the keyboard itself  .
the problem is with the touch sensitive buttons at the bottom of the screen  .
since they are touch sensitive , instead of being physical keys , i've found it's very easy to hit them while working/playing with something  .
for instance , while texting , i will accidentally hit the home key and it will completely kick you out of the text message you were working on the battery is a pain , but i'm not sure it's much different than other smartphones the speaker could be better  .
when using speaker phone , and more importantly the ringer and alarms , the sound could be louder  .
but i think that's also something i could live with the real problem i have had so far with the aria is that there is a bug with the texting app  .
while texting , sometimes the text predictability will crash  .
you'll get an error message that says you have to close the app  .
the only way to get the app to work again is to reboot the phone  .
obviously this can be a huge issue  .
i've been having to reboot the phone a couple of times a day  .
from reading on an htc site , htc is aware of the problem but have yet to create a fix the speed of the phone seems great to me  .
i have not experienced any lag or crashes (aside from the texting bug) .
this is an amazing phone  .
mind you , coming from an htc tilt may not be saying much  .
however , i'm certain i will never go back to a windows phone as they're too much about windows and not enough about phone  .
the battery life is the most frustrating thing  .
if the unwanted data    intensive apps could be removed users might not be as frustrated about the battery life  .
i'm optimistic that my battery will begin performing better over time (we'll see) .
get the phone  .
get a cover  .
do not leave apps on as overheating could be an issue  .
but in general  .
it's a great phone , i love it , it is very user friendly  .
i'm writing this review on it now , so it shows how easy the keyboard is to use .
a good compact phone  .
for a small phone this puppy packs a punch  .
i have had the phone for about 2months now and i really love it  .
the cons i said are just little things that i can work with  .
except for the bloatware being unremovable  .
come on at t are you kidding me  .
trying to free up space wouldnt be a problem if you could remove some apps you wont use .
i used to have lg vu and that is the worst phone i ever had  .
touch screen is bad and the battery life is the worst and i have to replace the battery 2x times before i decide to check out htcs and it is the best phone i had and i did not regret it even though my peers keeps tellng me to get the iphone4 instead  .
the phone is great and it has some apps that is useful , though at t crippled it with some 3rd party apps  .
screen is kinda small and i usually use the landscape to text instead of portrait mode  .
the only hing i missed in my lg vu is the voice dial for my bluetooth in my car  .
anyways it is a great phone and you will not get dissapointed on this  .
i highly recomend it  .
this is a great phone for average use i left iphone 3g and am real happy with the aria  .
although i use a imac at home i had to buy software to sync with my mac works great  .
(google missingsync to get it) i just wish steve jobs would let me have all my music  .
this is my first touch screen phone and so far i am very impressed  .
the small size is not as big of a problem for texting as i thought it would be  .
when sideways there is ample room for even my large fingers  .
though it does not have the 1ghz processor like the incredible , it still is very zippy with little lag  .
my only real frustration is the htc sense facebook app that comes with the phone only allows syncing with contact pictures for the first 100 facebook friends  .
of those , i only had about 20 contacts in my phone  .
simple fix is downloading an android app from the market  .
also , the battery life is just okay  .
with moderate use (internet , android market , games , etc) the battery needs charging before the end of the day  .
overall i am very impressed with this little phone  .
i would have to say i love it  .
at t finally has an android phone that isn  .
t embarrassing like the motorola backflip  .
definitely worth checking out the phone has a nice build that feels firm and a soft touch to the back  .
the accents definitely highlight the style that htc is going after  .
the 3  .
capacitive touch screen (480 x 320) could be bigger , but it does give you enough room to work with what  .
s on the screen  .
htc  .
s aria also sports 600mhz msm 7227 processor coupled with 512 mb rom and 384 mb ram  .
although not the speediest of the phones , this phone does give good performance in everyday use  .
d like to consider it a keyboardless , cuter version of the motorola droid (yes we are aware these are two completely different companies) read full review at http  //semiprose  .
com/2010/07/14/review    htc    aria/  .
thanks  .
this phone is great , especially for it's price  .
just make sure you have a charger handy .
i love this little phone  .
i can barely feel it in my pocket  .
other then the fact that at t crippled it , it's the best mid    range android out there  .
the battery life is a problem for me , for the last 3 days , the phone died on me before 9pm everyday with moderate use .
i bought this phone the day it hit the stores but i was not waiting on it  .
i is just there to finally upgrade though i had not seen anything in person that met my desired criteria  .
i is going to go with the htc tilt2 but it's the size of a dvr remote and weighs a ton  .
sitting right next to it on display is a phone that i'd not seen before  .
the aria  .
i had them bring out a charged phone and in 10 seconds i knew i is taking it home  .
the htc aria is a very solid phone in a well made , compact form .
i bought this phone the first day it come out , and so far i'm impressed big time  .
this is my first smartphone and touchscreen phone so it'll take time to definitely get used to  .
its a great size , fits perfectly in the had and so far have been using it nonstop and the battery is still 3/4 full if you have big fingers , i dont recommend this phone because of the small screen , i do not have a problem with the keyboard at all  .
they also have a landscape mode for the keyboard which helps hopefully at t can keep the android phones coming .
this may not be important to everyone , but the speaker is the worst of all cell phone i have tested  .
it may be lame , but i listen to music about 50% without earphones , because i do not always carry earphones around  .
no phone is going to sound great but some are usable for music  .
i gave up a simple t    mobile nokio 6301 for the htc aria  .
the nokiia is good for a cell phone  .
when i took the aria back to the att dealer to look for another model , the sales person said the sound is painfull when i played a few seconds of music  .
it is painfull  .
with the equalization like 10x on the high frequencys  .
comlpletly unusable for music  .
the saleman's iphone sounded great by comparison  .
i am trading the aria for an iphone , even though i would otherwise prefer the aria .
i really like the phone idea but att did not execute it properly  .
they're too busy pushing a horrible iphone and that appears to be where all of their energy is  .
they also will not let us know when or if this phone will get a 2  .
2 update  .
updated  .
on jul 17 , 2010  .
finally  .
a good phone landed on at t's sinking ship  .
even though this is already a great phone , it could be better if the screen was not so damn small  .
i mean , i like the compact    ness of it so it's actually comfortable to use (unlike the evo) but my thumbs are not really that small so i can imagine typing might be an issue for me  .
until i can make any conclusions , i'm gonna have to go to the store and check it out  .
but as far as it goes , it's probably the best at t alternative to the iphone as of right now  .

i is very excited to rid myself of the iphone , and after much research went with the htc aria  .
all i have to say is buyer beware  .
i don't know what htc is thinking , but they obviously don't expect people to drop their phones  .
because a week into owning it , it fell out of my stroller and the screen completely shattered  .
i mean bad  .
htc refused to do anything to help  .
stating that i should not have dropped my phone  .
(i know great customer service they do not have  .
) that is my major complaint with this phone  .
it's fragile  .
once a case is finally available i bought one for the replacement phone i purchased  .
and while this phone is easy to use , and looks nice the battery life sucks  .
i find the keyboard very easy to type on , and the phone offers a pretty decent response time  .
i do not know if it's at t (i suspect it is) but the reliability of cell signal is hit or miss  .
but it works just as well , if not better than my iphone ever did with the 3g and wifi options  .
the speaker phone and overall volume of the phone are a bit sad  .
the speaker phone hurts your ears if at full volume , and with the speaker on the back of the phone , if you have it lying on a counter or seat the ring is muffled  .
the camera is difficult to use simply because you hit the scroll knob to take the pic , but one small move and you exit the camera altogether overall i am happy with this phone , but i think that is primarily because my iphone 3g got so messed up from the o/s4 update  .
i do wish the android marketplace would hurry up and catch up with the iphone's  .
and in my opinion , i have yet to find anything as easy as buying music from itunes  .
so , i do miss that  .
but as far as phone quality goes the aria is far superior  .
far , far superior , and that is exactly what i is looking for  .
htc could really take a queue from apple though as far as their customer service is concerned , because folks it sucks .
when i first got the phone i loved i couldnt put it down but then when i had noticed that some of the apps on my evo werent on the aria i got frustrated i also got frustrated that it cannot use live wallpapers but besides those flawes the rest of the phone is pretty good .
this is my first android phone , and while i love android , htc's ability to create a good phone leaves a bit to be desired  .
i do not use a bluetooth earpiece , because i've had yet to find one that fits comfortably  .
this means the phone's regular speakers need to be decent at least  .
alas , that is not the case with the aria  .
i actually returned the first phone , because the sound is so low that you had to be in an almost silent room to have a phone conversation  .
the replacement phone is only slightly better  .
very slightly  .
and i can simply forget using the speaker phone , as the voices come out so broken up and garbled that its impossible to carry on a conversation  .
while the sound in earphones is quite good , the lack of speaker quality is a deal    breaker for me and that's too bad , because i love the aria's ease of use and quality otherwise  .
surfing the net is amazingly fast and easy for the most part , so much so that i've sometimes used the phone to surf rather than bothering to turn on my computer  .
the phone's various widgets (those not controlled by atandt's let's make 'em pay for everything attitude) work very well       and i love the many free games and apps available in the android marketplace unfortunately , playing with those games and apps drains the battery very , very quickly ; i've yet to get even a full day's worth of charge out of this phone  .
if you buy one , be sure to get a car charger if you're going to be out and about       believe me , you'll use it a lot  .
one app you will definitely want to download to help with that is some sort of app    killer program  .
that will help save some of the battery life the gist of all this  .
while the htc aria is a fun little (i love the size , by the way) android device , if you need an actual phone , and like me , cannot use a bluetooth headset , you might want to go with a different phone  .
i wish , at this point , that i'd either waited for the galaxy s phones to come out , or returned this one before the return date  .
i would recommend it to a friend , but only with serious reservations .
this is a very good phone  .
however i am pretty dissapointed that since i have had the phone    htc sense    the big reason i got this phone    does not work with face book  .
there is an htc/face book problem that has been going on for over a week now  .
nobody can sync their contacts with face book for htc sense which is the company's biggest selling point with the phone  .
htc needs to get their act in gear  .
otherwise , it is a good phone  .

i'd consider your options before buying this phone , first gen users always get the short straw  .
i moved back to my iphone .
i have had my phone for 2 weeks  .
it is so much fun to sit around and play with  .
unfortunately , it falters at it's main function reliable mobile phone  .
i don't know if it is because i came from a blackberry and it's call quality and reliability are so superior or what  .
but there are places i could use my blackberry that my aria will not work  .
i never had a dropped call on my bb either and this one drops calls on a daily basis and my husband says when he talks to me on the aria , the sound quality is not nearly as good and i break up alot  .
i have even had to do a reset on my phone because it just suddenly became unable to receive or complete calls to my son's cell phone  .
strange  .
it even had tech support perplexed  .
they checked out both our phones and determined his is doing what it is supposed to , but mine is malfunctioning  .
if you are looking for a toy and do not mind unreliable phone service , go ahead and purchase it , but i am taking my back and getting the bb bold 9700  .
it may not be as much fun to play with but bb's are amazing tools that do what i need them to do , when i need them to do it .
if you're not a heavy user , just go and get it otherwise go for something more powerful .
keyboard is a little too small  .
email integration is terrible  .
smart links only work sometimes  .
a lot of the htc widgets do not update unless you open the program , so why have a widget  .
calls sound hollow  .
speaker is tinny and quiet  .
the build quality is horrible , no way this things lasting through a 2 year contract  .
apps randomly launch in the background and i've used three different task managers i came from an iphone and am going right back  .
the idea of the sense ui is genius , once it actually works in a few years ill be all over it  .
until then you simply cannot beat the iphone .
if you are not sitting next to a power outlet this product will fail battery life is a joke please read the fourm's about this phone from all websites you will see that htc failed on this one  .
unless you like to pamper your phone , don't buy this one  .
i have had mine for two weeks , loved it  .
i wanted to change the micro sd card , so i tried to remove the battery cover (which is very difficult to do by the way)  .
in attempting to remove the cover , the screen shattered , yes , completely shattered  .
i did not drop it , step on it or throw it (all things that happened with my blackberry with no damage)  .
i can only imagine what would have happened if i would have dropped it  .
i cannot imagine going two years (length of my contract) without ever dropping my phone  .
htc r d department , you had better go back to the drawing board  .
overall i would have to give this phone a very good rating , however , do to it's frailty , i can give it no more than one half a star .
after an i phone this thing sux .
