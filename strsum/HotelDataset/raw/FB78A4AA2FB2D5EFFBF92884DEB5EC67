newquay is somewhat faded but it did make a great base to explore cornwall and devon .
thoroughly agree with the review from christine below .
yes , hotel is somewhat dated ( do ask for a refurbished room ) but it is in an excellent location facing the sea .
the bay is very clean and the bedlinen and tablecloths are high quality cotton , and ironed .
the mattress was excellent ( firm , just how we like it ) and we slept extremely well .
a massive plus is that the staff could not be more accommodating and friendly if you were paying for a suite at the ritz .
thank you especially to the wonderful and genial craig , who always remembered our drinks preferences ( 4 free drinks a day an amazingly generous add-on ) and cheerily helped sort out our wi-fi registration , our delightful waiters luis and jack , not forgetting the pleasant and efficient room maids and also the manager jackie ( she runs an excellent hotel ) who instantly gave us the room of our choice when we telephoned the morning of our arrival ( top floor , end of corridor to minimise noise ) .
do pay the extra for a sea view .
there is a bit of traffic noise , but we always travel with ear plugs , so no problem .
also , if you are travelling by car it is well worth reserving a car space in advance , and you will have your own dedicated bay right in front of the hotel , with your name . . .

can not speak for the entertainment by the way , as we did not participate .
this was our first weekend in a shearings hotel , but we were very pleasantly surprised , and we look forward to booking similar breaks at other hotels.
