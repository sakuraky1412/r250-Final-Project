best and fastest phone i ever had ( http  //www  .
speedtest  .
net/android/18817879  .
png )  .
this is my first smartphone  .
ve wanted to upgrade to one of the android smartphones for a while , but my choices had been depressing  .
ve been with t    mobile for years , and i love their customer service and have a pretty cheap unlimited calling plan with them  .
but you would think that the company that launched the android smartphones with the original g1 would keep pace , but with phones out there like the droid x , droid incredible , htc desire , and of course , the latest generation iphone (which i realize doesn  .
t run android , but it  .
s still serves the same function) , t    mobile lagged behind  .
for the longest time , the mytouch 3g slide is their top    rated phone , but to read the reviews on it , most critics were not impressed  .
and then came the samsung vibrant , but i  .
ve had issues with other samsung phones to the point that i don  .
t trust them but then came the g2  .
i read review after review , and the consensus is that not only is the g2 t    mobile  .
s best smartphone (not counting the slightly newer mytouch 4g) , it  .
s one of the best smartphones on the market , period the critical reviews all said many of the same things  .
s fast , they like the almost vanilla android froyo interface (though me personally , i do like htc  .
s usual flippy clock that reminds me of the one that used to wake me up for school every morning when i is a kid) , etc  .
like i said , this is my first smartphone , so i don  .
t have a lot to compare it to , but it does seem to be very fast and i do like the overall interface , better than my fiance  .
s htc hero  .
i also love the ability to have my phone messages , e    mail , facebook posts , google calendar notices , etc  .
, all come to one place that resides neatly in a case on my hip  .
plus all the apps and games are pretty cool i especially like the flip    out keyboard  .
i can actually text back when people text me now  .
i hated texting on a numeric keypad ; i  .
m almost as fast on this keypad as i am on a computer keyboard some of the negatives i  .
ve read in other reviews    .
(1) no wifi calling or tethering  .
within a week after i got the phone , the operating system is updated and now has these capabilities (2) heavy  .
s not really that heavy , though most phones feel cheap , light and plasticky next to it  .
i just think it feels like it has more substance than every other phone , but it  .
s not so heavy that it  .
s uncomfortable to carry or use  .
and htc used a lot of metal parts in the housing , which adds to the sense of substance that the phone has (3) big  .
s about the same dimensions of the apple iphones i  .
ve handled , and they don  .
t come with flip    out keyboards (4) the z    hinge might be unstable  .
the hinge seems pretty tight to me , and it opens and closes smoothly and surely , just with the light upward press of my thumbs  .
it also doesn  .
t act like it wants to break anytime soon  .
i will note that they keyboard is tricky , and so the smallest blockage will keep it from closing correctly  .
i found this to be the case when i bought a hard protective shell for it  .
the little  .
fingers  .
that hold the case on to the phone were enough to make the hinge swing freely from the slightest movement .
my only concern is that the phone does restart sometimes on its own  .
not sure if it's a software or hardware problem but it does restart once in a while by itself  .
this is my second g2 and it has had this problem less  .
tmobile knows it's a problem and they said a fix is in the works  .
device is awesome  .
i have t    mobile grandfathered in wi    fi calling plan that rolled out in 2007  .
g2 update by nov 8 will have app for wi    fi calling and for me , it will be like my tmo bb bold 9700    free calls in wi    fi with that grandfathered plan (got promo in 2007 $19  .
99 month for up to 10 lines on my biz acct    that rocks  .
the g2 is a great phone , mini laptop , etc  .
and the full side slide keyboard is awesome but the best is the voice texting , emailing , dialing  .
if you have t    mobile and want an awesome device that does it all , get the g2  .
i had been waiting , and waiting , and waiting for a complete smartphone to come onto the market  .
i would have bought the samsung vibrant if it hadn't been for some of the reviews here on cnet about the gps not being up to par  .
i am extremely glad i waited  .
this phone is the bomb  .
i upgraded from a razr v3t  .
first thing i want to say is   forget about the hinge concern that bonnie cha had with this phone it is rock solid  .
don't take my word for it  .
go to a t    mobile store and put it in your hands  .
turn it upside down and watch it separate like she did in the video , then try to wiggle it around  .
you will instantly be able to recognize just how sturdy it is hence the weight which is a good thing in my book  .
yes , it is heavy compared to other smartphones but that is because it is not plastic  .
this thing is built to last  .
unlike most of the other android phones on the market , the os is straight android 2  .
no motoblur (my brother has a motorola cliq which he is still waiting for an os upgrade) , no genius , no touch wiz , or anything else to get in the way of the perfection that is google android  .
even the simplest little things like live wallpaper (i am using water as my wallpaper which is a maple tree reflected in water with leaves that fall into the water and make it ripple  .
it also ripples when you touch the screen as though you are sticking your finger in the water  .
awesome  .
) are complete eye candy to me  .
seven home screens  .
excellent call quality  .
plenty of free aps on the android marketplace and because it is straight android , you can even install non    android marketplace aps  .
battery life is absolutely exceptional and , despite this phone being 800 mhz instead of 1 ghz , it is very fast and responsive  .
everything , even the camera , works on this phone and works very well  .
there simply is not a better all around t    mobile phone on the market and i would put it up against everything else available from the other carriers  .
i could not be happier with my purchase  .
bottom line it truly is the best that t    mobile has to offer , i''ve traded the samsung vibrant for this and this is what i call an upgrade  .
this phone is faster , the battery last alot longer and is running the latest android 2  .
believe is not only t    mobile's best but of the best phone on the market today hands down .
for a t    mobile customer this is the best phone available  .
my brother owns the the mytouch 3g slide  .
it is an excellent phone but i'm glad i waited for the g2  .
the network runs faster , the phone feels more solid , and the input options (slide out qwerty , onscreen w/ swype) are excellent and intuitive  .
the camera w/ flash works well for both still photos and video (up to 720p resolution for video) .
the complaints that people have are minor screens not as good as the galaxy s but then again galaxy s is gold standard for screens beating out iphone 4 so no other phone has a screen that good , another is that its comes wit too many google apps but if you can afford this phone then you cand afford a sd card and some of the apps were fun and useful a few times , then another complaint is that no tethering or hotspot feature only time when tethering or hotspot would come in handy is if u need internet and ur latop has no wifi , but those feature are built in so it will be activated eventually , and the final complaint is the hinge and so fa while i wouldnt say i prefer it to the sliders its just as good and a viable option , and have no prolem using the hinge , its strong and wo not break easily , plus if your complaining that i closes whe you hold it upside down then get real when the crap are you going to hold it upside down , while it may not beat out vibrant hands down (even though it should since it has already beat out the samsung epic and the epic is better than the vibrant) , either way its a win win for tobile customers they et two great phones  .
this is an amazing phone in every way  .
the z hinge is fine great design  .
the voice search and swype is so good , i'm not actually opening the phone and using the keyboard that much  .
my previous phone is the samsung vibrant  .
it is so slow compared to the g2  .
google voice would take 8 seconds to show voice mail transcriptions on the vibrant on the g2 , it's instant .
i love my new g2 and of course the great customer service at t    mobile  .
i cannot think of a single thing to complain about  .
highly recommended  .
the product is solid  .
the features are more than i'll ever use  .
the functionality makes me efficient , saves time  .
i would recommend it to anyone .
i is very skeptical about taking my vibrant back and getting this phone  .
i must say that i am very happy with my decision though  .
my husband and i both had the vibrant and now we compare phones and my g2 wins   ) although the vibrant has a beautiful screen the g2 is the way to go  .
i haven't had any problems with it at all  .
i like the stock android and that we already have 2  .
2 without having to do anything extra  .
i don't like rooting and all that because i do not really know what i am doing , so this phone is the whole package for me  .
this is t    mobiles best smartphone available right now  .
if your with tmobile and are looking into a new phone this is the one  .
so i purchased my g2 yesterday , heck not even 24 hours ago  .
and i know already that me and this phone are going to have a great relationship for sure  .
i'm pretty much absolutely in love with this phone  .
it's useful on nearly every level  .
i'm a 10 year windows mobile veteran , but after the htc touchpro 2 i had to make a change  .
the g2 is pretty much i wanted the htc touchpro 2 to be first let me talk about the processor  .
i is one of the many people put off by the 800 ghz processor  .
i know my biggest gripe with the touchpro 2 is it's lackluster speed  .
that phone is 500 mhz , and it moved like a snail and constantly froze up  .
i knew that my new phone would need to be packing a punch , and 800 mhz didn't seem like a major upgrade  .
however after reading some reviews and hearing the processor is optimize for the software , i decided to take the plunge  .
i'm am much impressed  .
i just keep waiting for an application to hang up or freeze , but everything pulls up right away  .
this snapdragon processor is a true champ , and it seems like it can handle pretty much anything the other thing that has to sell me on a phone is it's web browsing capabilities , and the g2 shines really well in this department  .
as a matter of fact , i don't think there is another phone on the market which handles web browsing so well  .
i found myself never having to pull out my laptop , and on my train ride to work i can pull up all of my favorite sites sometimes faster than i can on my pc  .
the flash support is a real turn on too  .
i know i look at many video game and tech sites that happen to have embedded flash videos  .
usually i'd have to wait to get to my nearest pc to view these videos , but no more  .
it'll play the flash video  .
sure there will be a slight lag here and there , but overall it's pretty fast  .
and the best thing it does not crash the browser  .
this happened constantly on my touchpro 2 with skyfire , making using skyfire and flash pretty much pointless  .
i am not even sure when i'll use my pc again , because it almost feels like i don't need to the only thing that has put my off slightly is the keyboard  .
being a windows mobile vet like i am , i'm not very use to phones that make heavy use of touch screens  .
the phones i've owned has been the mda , wing , touchpro 2 , the dash , etc  .
for the most part i'm use to phones having some sort of keyboard  .
the touchpro 2 is probably the best keyboard i've ever used , and unfortunately the g2 just does not compare  .
sure it's alright , and i'll get use to it , but it's the real drawback for me this being my first android phone , i'm simply not impressed with the email client  .
sorry it does not impress me one bit  .
i'm very use to windows mobile interfaces and notifications  .
it seems so outlook and pc like , and it makes a lot of sense to me  .
i find the stuff i need to do to navigate through folders just plane stupid  .
then again , it's useable , but i don't like the interface one bit  .
also i loved the notifications letting me know how much unread mail i have  .
something i either cannot find or plain out don't exist on android  .
i'm sure theres a better app out there for this , but out of the box it's feels like child's play  .
i'm also going to miss activesync and outlook integration  .
but i'll maintain until i feel i need to replace this with a windows mobile phone (which will definitely be a year or two from now) the touch screen also feels a little to sensitive  .
as i said before i come from the windows mobile world , so i'm use to resistive touch screens  .
sure they are a little unresponsive , but you learn to adjust  .
i find myself sending a lot premature text messages , or texting people i don't mean to text  .
something that is rare on windows mobile outside of those gripes , i love this phone  .
i can adjust to the keyboard , the capacitive touch screen , and the lackluster mail client (this is going to take awhile though)  .
i would rather sacrifice those things to have an os that doesn't crash and burn everytime i try to do the smallest things though  .
and hspa+ in the atlanta area is great  .
i'm always getting h's anywhere i go besides work (but i do not think anyone get's a signal here)  .
i would highly recommend this to anyone who does heavy duty web browsing on their phone .
i have had the device for a week now  .
is very skeptical in the beginning , but now i'm loving it  .
the phone is very smooth/zippy , and there is no lag at all  .
the stock android feels clean , and the phone does not have much bloatware  .
google has installed a few permanent apps that not all of us use , but it's not much of a bother really the hspa+ speeds are impressive  .
i installed the speedtest app and my down speeds are always 7mbs and up  .
maps load up in no time    satellite view or not  .
the gps locks down right away , and it is super accurate  .
it shows what part of the building i'm in , and also indicates the direction i'm facing (if i'm holding the phone upright and not horizontal) most impressive is the battery life  .
it has been 24+ hours since i unplugged my phone from my charger  .
the battery level is at 32%  .
incredible  .
incredible  .
incredible  .
phone quality is good  .
it's loud enough  .
not crystal clear , but it does the job for me  .
also , i have not dropped any calls yet , so that's a bonus i love the keyboard for typing  .
i am used to the iphone's on screen keyboard , so never thought i needed a physical one  .
but i find it very convenient , and i'm quicker with it  .
just me , i guess  .
i like the swype keyboard too , but pleased with a physical keyboard  .
i like it having the best of both worlds also , as a previous iphone user , i is concerned about syncing my music with the phone  .
the phone's sd card has a setup file for doubletwist  .
it's not the quickest program for syncing  .
however , it scans my itunes and loads up all of my playlists , including my purchased songs  .
so i'm really happy that when i update my itunes playlits , doubletwist will reflect the changes so i can sync my songs the way i find convenient to sum it all up  .
i'm delighted i purchased this phone  .
it is either this or the vibrant for me  .
the stock android made my decision easy  .
after a week heavy use and evaluation of the phone , i'm glad i bought this phone  .
this is a great phone although it takes a bit of getting used to switching from blackberry to android 2  .
the z hinge has given me no problems , and i like it better than a slider  .
it works easily and feels like it will last .
everything is great in this phone , i wish there should be front facing camera and tethering option , htc needs to work on charging port and speaker .
the phone is comparable to the iphone in side and weight  .
it's a little larger and heavier  .
but then again i don't feel like it would break if it dropped it , compared to the shattering iphone screen the android software took a day or two to get used to but overall i like it as much and possibly even better than the ios on the iphone  .
the tactile keyboard is a nice option  .
and swipe is much better than the iphone's auto    incorrect feature  .
i like the interactive widgets as an option for apps that are used more often than others  .
these are better than any widgets i've used for the iphone , especially after getting the beautiful widgets app the basic music player is not as good as the iphone , but meridian media player supports flac files  .
and since more than half of my music collection is in flac format , this is a huge plus for me  .
and there are other alternative music player apps that you can download  .
(even one that looks like the iphone player)  .
i tried switching from the 2g to the g1 when the phone first came out and it is unsuccessful due to how new the android software is and the low battery life of the g1 brick however , now i'm switching from the 3g to the g2 , and i have to say i do not think i'll be looking back  .
hspa+ is fast , and it's nice not needing to jailbreak (or root) my phone on the t    mobile network  .
also , i'm a huge fan of open    source software and apple's ios signature/anti    jailbreak/anti    customer garbage has really turned me away from the last device apple had me hooked by the pocket with 5/5 stars  .
there are only a few minor software issues or hardware annoyances  .
but nothing limiting or restricting during normal or extensive use .
i use the phone as a phone , sure you can text , take pictures , watch videos and play games but the call quality is excellent , reception is good and it looks really good like the razor was  .
i have camera for pictures a computer for email and a ps3 for the games the bottom line like the summary says bad    ash phone im moist just talking about it  .
i bought this outright , contract free , to replace a blackberry curve that is becoming increasingly annoying  .
i am over the moon with the choice  .
the only drawback i can mention , and it is not much , is that the screen is shiny and shows smudges easily  .
but then so does the iphone and at least my screen is not made of glass  .
i've lost count of the number of broken iphones i've seen cnet is partially wrong  .
you can tether the g2  .
it is not yet officially supported but will be soon  .
and there are third party apps (easytether , for example) that will work quite nicely i've had no problems with the z    hinge (other than it not being obvious which side it is on when you want to open it) and have a hard time imagining why you would want to use your phone upside down  .
but if you're in the habit of doing that , you always have the android keyboard with swype as a backup i imported some less obnoxious notification sounds from the default windows noises  .
the ones built in are far too loud and jangly to use in an environment where you have lots of meetings or classes there's also a nice calendar extension , quick calendar , which makes the calendar searchable and also puts your next few meetings on the notification bar on the home screen  .
that's useful  .
now if only google will let me delete past appointments , i'll be set updated  .
on oct 8 , 2010  .
i've had the g2 for 3 days now and after tweaking and adding apps , making calls this is just thee phone to have if your on the tmo network to date  .
it feels great in the hand  .
call quality has been the best i've had in recent date  .
the bluetooth connectivity has to be mentioned here  .
i've had the mytouch slide and when using that phone paired with a bluetooth headset , about 3 feet would cause static , while 10 feet will completely disconnect it from the phone  .
this g2 connects strongly with my plantronics and theres no static whatsoever  .
this is a big point for me  .
the keyboard feels great  .
love swype  .
stock android should be the prefered os  .
the metal battery cover is a very nice add on (love the htc g2 incraving in the metal) plus instead of struggling to get the battery cover off , they added a slidding button on the side that easily pops that cover off (wallla  .
this is the design i've been looking for  .
almost a nexus one looking with a qwerty keyboard  .
like i said my only desin flaw may be the placement of the microsd card  .
i really prefer an external entry for these instead of it being hidden under the battery  .
the hinge , i have no issue with  .
love this phone  .
htc did it again  .
the overall product is an excellent device  .
the phone feels extremely premium in hand , and the only complaints are the mandated apps t mobile adds and the missing 2 froyo features  .
i have not seen any extra play in the hinge , and that seems very tight to me  .
i cannot see any reason why it wont last .
worth the upgrade  .
especially if you have had the g1 .
i purchased this phone on the third of october  .
and i don't regret it at all  .
i still have my nexus one  .
this is definitely an considerable upgrade  .
its basically the nexus on steroids  .
faster , bigger and stronger  .
and we still have vanilla , so updates should hit this phone first  .
this baby is future proof  .
2 years from now it will still be ticking  .
people yes the phone really does have the 4gb as advertised  .
google g2 forums , xda has found the missing 2gb  .
froyo is unable to read more than 2gb of internal storage , fix should be out soon the display dosen't have the black levels , nor the color like the nexus one has  .
but it's brighter and the colors look more natural and realistic  .
the sound is slightly louder  .
the speeds are great if you are in an hspa+ area  .
i'm in cincinnati and in those areas i have reached downloads speeds of 9000 kbps where my nexus one would give me around 4000 kbps  .
you will only see this difference in hspa+ areas  .
regular 3g areas the speed is the same on both devices  .
so some of you may not see the benefit of the hspa+ yet  .
for example , in my home i have a mediocore 3g signal  .
both devices average around 600 kbps download speeds  .
so just be patient , this baby is fast now the hinge , which does come loose when you hold the phone upside down  .
but why and how can you use the phone like that  .
personally i trust htc , this company has a proven track record  .
so do not let that defer you from enjoying this delicious dish of creamy vanilla  .
pure android at it's finest the keyboard is nice and pretty well design  .
you have three programmable keys maybe one to many  .
just my opinion  .
also a designated @ key and www  .
key which is shared with  .
com  .
also quick office is a great app  .
and it's pre    installed  .
if you're looking for a new phone , check this baby out .
go buy it  .
great phone for us keyboard lovers loaded nes , snes , sega emulators on it and it runs perfect .
bottom line       with the features and speed of the network available to you          this is the phone to get updated  .
on oct 1 , 2010  .
this is my first android device and what a device it is it feels firm in your hand    solid , quality build  .
the processor is fast    much faster (at 800mhz) than my hd2 (at 1ghz)  .
the battery life is impressive  .
the keyboard is very very easy to get used to    and the programmable keys are a great touch  .
going from a 4  .
3 screen on my hd2 , i thought the screen would seem small    not at all  .
and the quality of the picture is real , real good  .
an all around good phone and i did not even mention the fast hspa+ speed of it on the network updated  .
on oct 3 , 2010  .
my only gripe is the physical functionality  .
watch the cnet video review , you will see the hinge  .
i don't think its wise to sell several hundred dollar devices that aren't very physically reliable that aside however i love this phone  .
i can switch from facebook , then to a voice    to    text instantly  .
so far all apps works great  .
the slowest apps are music players , but only on boot up camera is decent quality  .
sharing is a snap hspa+ / 4g is fast in the twin cities , mn  .
browsing the web is almost like browsing at home  .
streaming shoutcast , other internet radio and youtube in hd is effortless  .
a little buffering time    about 15 seconds or less    and you're off to the races i love that you can synchronize your gmail contacts to your phone , android is awesome  .
i chose this phone over t    mobile's sansung galaxy because the sales rep told me the g2 is a  pure  android phone  .
in that samsung's phone run primarily on droid but also have the samsung software on there too my previous phone is a samsung slider prepaid thru tracfone , so this is quite a jump into the future for me  .
overall i am very happy with my purchase , i just hope the hinge does not get any worse .
i is waiting for winphone 7 but no keyboard on the first release phones , no cut and paste no multitasking no legacy apps so i decide i would try android  .
had the phone for 3 weeks , and i'm surprised how much i like it i am coming from a touchpro 2 , which i loved  .
the g2 seems lighter and is almost half the size i need my phone to do work and play , no android text twist    ( i had to find a work around for outlook to sync with my non exchange account , did , syncs my home outlook to gmail calendar , gmail to phone integrates with home/work calendars but keeps work calendar only for work  .
you can make the phone totally unique to you or not  .
i like having the choice i really wish the battery lasted longer on the charge  .
the hspa network eats the battery  .
i try to just use the 2g during the day  .
i'm a pretty heavy user and the battery just makes it to 6pm , if i only use the h network i find new apps (mostly free) that i like every day  .
it take up to a 32gb sd card and files are easily transferred from computer to sd card via usb  .
i is able replace most of my favorite winmo apps with either updated versions or with new , better apps  .
once this phone is rooted and they make a better battery for it , it will be a most excellent phone .
the phone is super fast and good looking , i love the hot keys on the keyboard , android have tons of great apps  .
i just switched from the htc touch pro 2 and i do not miss it one bit  .
it will really be great when t    mobile let you use it to it's full capabilities .
the review of this phone is very underrated because of the hinge problem is made to seem has if people is really going to hold there phone that way  .
bonnie cha basically throw the phone upside down so it could loosen not every phone is like that , the only real other way the phone will loosen is if you put a case on it which will give it extra wight , even then it does not just fall  .
other then that the t    mobile g2 is great phone outperforming the g1 and nexus one and a list of other new phones  .
i like this phone a lot  .
i've had it for about 2 weeks  .
the only problems i have are   tinny speakers (i don't usually use it for calls , but i am a very heavy youtube watcher and music listener and listening to music from the g2 without headphones is a pain in the ear  .
) , youtube videos don't really fit the whole screen , i cannot pinch to zoom on mobile websites (customer care said the mobile site is manufactured to fit the screen , but there are times when i want to zoom in on pictures on mobile sites) , zhinge is a big problem to me only because i thought the phone is defected , but i hardly use the keyboard unless if i need to do a lot of texting in emails and whatnot  .
screen quality is not as excellent as the galaxy s , but it is still great  .
everything else works perfectly fine  .
no glitches or lags  .
very simple to use  .
i had the samsung vibrant and returned it because it had too many problems that kept getting me frustrated  .
i do not plan on replacing my g2 until tmobile sells a phone that is just like it with better speaker quality  .
awesome phone with fast internet speed  .
dont let the 800mhz processor scare you away from this phone  .
the phone is just as fast as other compairable 1gh processor phones (im guessing this is due to the phone's dedicated graphics process adreno 205) battery life is extended due to underclocking this phone's processor    i no longer have to charge my phone at work just to make it through the day  .
if you want a physical keyboard and love the android os you have to get this phone .
i've carried almost every smartphone , pda , blackberry by t    mobile at some point in time  .
the g2 is one of the great ones i have not loved a phone like this one since my blackberry 8900 .
all around a great phone , although i would have liked a front facing camera , hotspot and tethering support , and the display and gpu are not quite top of the line  .
this is a great display , very crisp and clear , but i do prefer the galaxy s super amoled display for the richer colors , deeper blacks , 4 vs  .
the 3  .
7 of the g2 , and possible energy efficiency side by side comparison with the vibrant on video quality and smoothness , i give the vibrant the definite edge  .
however , it had the definite edge in web page loading and speedtest  .
net testing vs the vibrant  .
the g2 has excellent reception , with both the hspa network and its wifi ; i have clocked speeds of consistent 14m+ over wifi and 5m+ with hspa  .
the downside here is that although i live in an hspa+ claimed area , the phone's network icon does not distinguish between the 2 , so i have no way of knowing that i am actually on hspa+ , until i clock the claimed speeds , which has not happened so far this is the best battery life i have had in a phone , easily getting 12hr of use (although i do turn off the wifi when not actually using it) , and love the usb charging capability i assume some will figure out how to hack it for tethering and hotspot , so this is not a big drawback for me at the moment , but it sure would have been nice to have out of the box this phone looks and feels solid and elegant , although the z mechanism takes a little getting used to in opening and closing  .
overall , i really like the size , feel , and layout of the keyboard , but would have liked a dedicated row for numbers  .
as i do not text alot , i still prefer a physical keyboard so this is a major + for me , although i can see how swype may change my mind google apps   earth , maps/nav , voice , etc are major + for me , so do not at all mind that these are integrated overall , a great android , physical keyboard phone , and am happy with the purchase so far  .
updated  .
on oct 12 , 2010  .
this phone is beautiful , solid and well designed  .
the hinge is really a non    issue unless you hold your phone upside down , clenched between your fingernails or hold it upside down gripping just the bottom edge of the keyboard  .
the complaints are like saying the lid of a pot falls off when you put it on the stove upside down so far the phone has been great  .
most of the things that i didnt like had an app that is able to make the phone the way i want it  .
all the phone functions work well  .
google voice works well as a way to avoid using plan minutes  .
the phone seems fast  .
its really beautiful to look at and fun to use  .
i love swype for times i dont feel like really typing  .
it's surprisingly accurate  .
as far as the hspa+ its fast when its available , but it seems to cut in and out a lot then there are the things that i wish the phone had not because i would necessarily use them , but because they would be cool to have  .
tethering , mobile hotspot , front facing camera the phone is a bit heavy , but you get used to it  .
the battery life could be better but i am used to a blackberry lasting a few days  .
i am not sure how it compares to other smart phones in the same class  .
the battery lasts me from about 7am to 9pm with moderate use  .
the location of the charging port makes it awkward to use when its charging .
the phone is great for work i need a phone that is fast and intuitive and the g2 has that feature , i did owned the vibrant before the g2 could not stand the entire samsung eco system , the g2 is zippi and i think it could be the work horse that i is looking for  .
best investment i've made in a while , i really feel like this phone can really conpete with the iphone 4 .
this is a really nice phone  .
everything seems well thought out  .
it is really great because everything google comes preloaded  .
it's solid when closed , and pretty solid open  .
a huge issue i have is that i cannot find a way to link duplicate contacts  .
i want all contacts to have all info under one name , with their facebook picture  .
this may have been overlooked when opting not to load with htc sense  .
the incredible is a lot easier to organize and customize  .
(please comment if there is a way to do so on the g2 that i have overlooked)  .
the track pad is pretty nice as well  .
it takes getting used to remembering that it's there  .
when you do , it makes navigating web more effortless , since your thumb is pretty much right there updated  .
on oct 9 , 2010  .
g2 is a very good and style phone with lots of capabilities , but it's durability is still not certain .
bottom line until t    mobile gets an iphone , this is as close as you can get to performance and looks  .
this phone one ups the iphone because 2  .
2 allows you to have complete control over customizing the phones components .
the g2 is a very trick phone with the highest quality key board i have ever see on a smart phone  .
but you will pay for this key board with the weight and thickness of this phone  .
i only rated it four stars but if i had bought it i know i would have gave it a 5 star review  .
every smart phone seems to have an advantage over the others  .
it's tough to choose  .
i am still with my old motorola v360 that i have had for four years  .
it's dose not dig into my pay check as much every month as a smart phone will  .
i know i will be getting a smart phone soon because my claim phone is old and dying  .
but i am trying to get some more mileage out of it before i jump on the big monthly bill wagon that i will have to fork out once i get a smart phone  .
t    mobil's main advantage is that is gives the top service of all the carriers and costs the least .
i is able to tether the phone to my pc using pda net and downloaded at 800kb/sec , which is simply incredible  .
i have no idea if this download speed will continue as more and more people get hspa+ phones  .
i'm upgrading from an old blackberry 8310 , so this is massive leap forward    i love being able to watch youtube videos and surf the web easily frankly i still think the iphone interface is a little more intuitive , but android gets the job done well enough  .
i haven't even begun to explore the plethora of free applications out there  .
i find that the slide    out physical keyboard is far easier to use than the touch screen options , but i've only had it for a day and there's definitely a learning curve i urge folks to go try these phones out in a real t mobile store before making your decision  .
i tried almost all of the android phones , and found the cheaper ones to have inferior responsiveness and multimedia capabilities  .
plus they are on the older slower network i'm grading this down from 5 to 4 stars , because i find it too bulky and heavy , and it's frankly hamstrung by the crappy tmobile interface that sits atop of android (tmozones)  .
perhaps with further investigation i will find a way to remove this , but the bulk wo not go away  .
that said , some people prefer the bulk .
if someone is looking for nice , and superfast android phone but does't care for the weight then this phone is for you .
by far a huge improvement over my curve 8900  .
users coming from bb will have an adjustment period for the new spacious keyboard updated  .
on oct 5 , 2010  .
i am coming from a blackberry 8900 and have been searching for that perfect phone  .
i had a vibrant and returned it for various reasons and is counting on this phone being it for me some have described the g2 as the german car of cell phones , and i can see where that comes from  .
this phone definitely gives off a classy , more luxurious vibe with its metallic shine and substantial feel  .
that's where the bulkiness and weight can be a con for folks  .
for me , it was not a huge issue , but i couldn't easily just throw it into my back pocket like my more compact and slim blackberry one reason i got the g2 is for the physical keyboard , because coming from a crackberry , i feel comfortable with the feeling of buttons  .
the spacing of the keyboard is a little odd for me it being more wide and feeling as if you had to stretch your thumbs across a bit  .
it just took a little adjusting  .
however , the touch keyboard is so great for me that it made me rethink how desirable a physical keyboard truly is for me  .
i found myself using the landscape touch keyboard more than the physical one  .
each letter/number key on the screen is big , and the autocorrecting is very helpful  .
that's how good the touch keyboard was i am considering phones without any physical keyboards now the internet browser   awesome  .
very fast speeds and can open flash websites i am already a fan of google maps , but with the upgrade to this google phone , i is spoiled by the navigation  .
you had your very own gps device that tells you turn by turn directions  .
i used it when i is searching for a friend's house after getting out of the station , and i didn't have that awkward moment of figuring out which direction to start  .
the voice told me , and the map aligned exactly to where your body is facing  .
i is amazed there seemed to be only one small speaker for listening to music and other media , but it is very loud  .
the only thing is that the sound is a bit tinny  .
some people complained about the speakerphone being tinny  .
i didn't notice during my phonecalls , but it makes sense if the music sounded tinny that a person's voice would , too i use my phone a lot walking around manhattan , but it is pretty much useless during the day time  .
the screen resembled those mirror screen protectors  .
i couldn't see a thing  .
the voice command system is ridiculous on the phone  .
i feel like you can ask it to do anything  .
it is very accurate in the content i'd dictate for emails and texts  .
it would google map and find things on the internet through voice command the pictures were just ok  .
i didn't play around with the camera that much i would honestly stick with this phone , as i think it's the best phone tmobile has to offer , and i loved the experience  .
but i had to return it because i need wifi calling due to no signals in my apartment  .
i could not wait for that soon to be coming ota update to allow wifi calling on the g2 i'm waiting for the mytouch hd which is supposedly coming out november 3  .
it will already come capable of wifi    calling and a front    facing camera  .
yay  .
i hope to finally have my perfect phone .
a good solid reliable phone to have .
definitely , the t    mobile g2 is a great phone , but coming from the iphone , it has many shortcomings  .
true , it will take me a while to get used to the device , but there are somethings that almost had me return the phone , such as the fact that the guy who sold me the phone didn't change the internet feature from smartphone internet (when i had the iphone on t    mo) to android internet reason why i did not have internet for 2 days  .
once that is fixed (45 minutes of my life i'll never get back) the internet is blazing fast i know my apartment is a mobile phone dead zone (i get zero bars with both at$t and t    mo) , but when i step out of the property , the g2 picks up full strength signal right away  .
with the iphone on t    mo i'd had to get about a block away from my building and set the phone in airplane mode and back before i could get a decent signal , well either that or to wait about 5 minutes until it decides on its own that i should have the privilege of a signal what really bothers me is the total lack of support for pc/mac synchronization  .
really  .
ok , sync with google and facebook accounts what about the contacts i have in my pc  .
my music  .
movies  .
the little support given by a few third party apps is incomplete and iffy at best while accessories , should not drive the purchase of a phone , the amount and quality of them will add on to the overall experience  .
well other than basic accessories (car chargers , cases , bluetooth earpieces , etc) there is very little variety  .
good luck finding a car holster that charges your phone and sends the audio to your car stereo bottom line , the little annoyances makes up for the half star i took away from this phone  .
the lack of tethering and pc/mac sync makes up the full star i took away  .
gimme all the above and you'll have a 5    star phone .
good phone just not great  .
my nexus one is a better functional phone than the g2  .
i may hang on to both but hotspot is very important for my use .
solid phone overall  .
it has a heaviness a lot of people enjoy , a few won't  .
keyboard is great , i is hoping the number keys would be separate from the letter keys but not a problem  .
plain android software is not my thing but again you might like it  .
all the useless google applications can not be deleted , again you might not mind but i do  .
low amount of internal memory but again you might not mind  .
5mp with flash is not bad and is worthy of taking most pics you will need to take the external speaker is so so and when i called people i is pushing the phone into my ear to hear them (you really have to have the speaker at the right angle on your ear or the person wo not be that loud)  .
overall a great 2  .
2 froyo device but i is not impressed as i thought i should have been  .
the g2 could have been a little better but again it has froyo 2  .
2 and the software is still better than samsung's i'm getting the mytouch 4g but this is a solid phone  .
i feel the samsung vibrant is slightly better but it does not have froyo or a flash for the camera good luck  .
much better than g1 , but they should have kept the qwerty keyboard on the touch screen .
g2 or blackberry  .
after using blackberries for 9 years , i thought it is time for a change  .
i is bored  .
bought the g2 the week it came out  .
and returned it a week later  .
it is a fantastic phone , don  .
t get me wrong , but it has one major flaw   the inability to maintain the confidentiality of data when syncing the g2 only allows syncing the phone with an exchange server  .
you cannot locally download contacts or calendar data to your phone  .
it is strongly suggested using gmail (it  .
s a google phone  .
) but any exchange server does it  .
i have a lot of highly confidential client data in my contacts and syncing with the  .
cloud  .
, gmail or not , is unacceptable  .
therefore , the phone became useless and i had to return it  .
it would be helpful if t    mobile becomes more detailed when suggesting one can sync with outlook  .
you can only sync with outlook via the cloud , not directly  .
htc seems to offer sync features for some other phones (including android devices) but not for the g2 syncing with exchange servers or yahoo or hotmail works extremely well  .
it is fast and accurate an android annoyance is the tiny email fonts , which cannot be changed (unless somebody writes new and complete email software , which will happen at some point as android is an open platform)  .
people over 45 definitely need glasses to read emails as rim missed integrating the business and fun crowd , android and htc make the same mistake , just from the other side  .
guess who seems the g2  .
s target group  .
when texting , the comma can be found on the second page of the screen keyboard but the  .
is on the main page  .
the typical g2 user apparently finds texting in sentences uncool and instead expresses himself through faces on many other issues , however , the phone is great  .
4g is super fast and the browser works great (you can have several pages open)  .
live streaming from youtube , for example , seems as fast as on an office computer  .
this depletes the battery very quickly , though  .
the g2 is very stable and never crashed  .
however , i did not download many outside applications  .
android seems to have issues with the compatibility of older software and the new 2  .
2 operating system  .
the open platform framework (which in principal i am a big fan of) seems to have serious limitations if existing software becomes outdated with the introduction of a new os version wireless (including n) works great although more complicated encryptions are not captured  .
wifi calling does not work , though oh , yes , the phone function  .
the phone actually works great  .
excellent reception and very good sound so , without the confidentiality concerns , the g2 would get 5 stars  .
overall , i am back to my boring blackberry  .
it works .
i hit a t    mobile store the instant a working demo came out  .
after 20 minutes , i have to admit   i'm not very impressed  .
first , the screen  .
it's either too heavy or the hinge is too weak  .
if you hold it up to take a picture , it slams shut  .
i frequently carry my phone in my pocket and the g2 has an exposed wire  .
if anything gets caught , it could tear it and bye    bye $299 phone  .
i cannot believe they overlooked that  .
i frequently use mine to listen to music so access to the sd card is important  .
they moved it behind the battery  .
how is that an improvement  .
i think i'm gonna break the cover if i keep removing it  .
the keyboard is a major selling point for me  .
you now have to hold the alt button to type numbers  .
this makes it very awkward to type and i'm text message all the time  .
i did a speed test with all kinds of short and long sentences  .
no matter how hard i tried , i could always type significantly faster with my old g1 because it had a separate set of numerical keys  .
also  .
the g2's keys are spaced so far apart that i have to stretch my fingers to reach letters like t , g and h  .
this phone is not for people with small hands like me  .
i text message in poorly lit places frequently so i cannot believe the keyboard doesn't light up any more  .
i looked at the samsung galaxy s , which also got rave reviews and have decided to hold off until the g3 comes out  .
sorry t    mobile , but i don't see a massive improvement here and you've had two years to fix the problems , not introduce new ones  .
htc did not necessarily miss the boat but they fell in the water and climbed back in all dripping wet .
i think that t    mobiles big advertisement hitter for the g2 is the '4g'  .
whatever they say , if you look at speeds , hspa+ is not a 4g network  .
however if you view it just as t    mobile saying its their fourth network setup then i suppose  .
the phone is ugly to me  .
i love android , and i love htc , but the looks on the phone are just terrible .
if the phones call quality is better id keep it  .
the swyping is the funnest thing about it  .
its a really nice phone if your not the kind of person who likes to talk on the phone much this might be the right fit for you but as for me the main reason to buy a phone is to be able to talk on it  .
overall id say its a poor exuse for a smart phone considsering this is the g2 and should have been a very good android phone  .
it has a slower cpu than the samsung galaxy s and less internal memory as well  .
also the screen is better on the galaxy s as well  .
the call quality is also better on the samsung galaxy s  .
id say skip this phone and get the galaxy s it a better phone  .
i reterned the g2 and kept my samsung galaxy s updated  .
on oct 6 , 2010  .
seems like an awesome phone but be careful    it can break very easily  .
i've spoken with everyone who has smartphones and they've said they drop them all the time    do not drop this phone and definitely consider the insurance    even though with the insurance its still a lot to replace  .
ugh  .
its a pretty cool phone the only thing i cant stand is that it keeps freezing up on me i cant do anything when it freezes on me it wont recognize that im trying to do something on the touch screen it reallyyyy sucks cuz itll stay stuck like that for such a long time it also keeps disconnecting my phone calls im not the patient type so the fact it keeps doing that is the reason im returning it i wouldnt recommend it to a friend its jus been a hassle since the start  .
t    mobile pre    loads these with apps that you cannot remove , even with an uninstaller  .
if you run an appkiller , you'll see there are always 10    12 or more apps running automatically , even if you go in and try to stop them from running automatically or shut off their notification function  .
they're designed so that if you run an appkiller , they almost all instantly respawn  .
i haven't done a root yet , but i've read that t    mobile's g2s are even programmed to reset automatically after you do that too  .
this is a great piece of hardware  .
but if you're a person who likes to have control over your device and what's running on it , steer clear of t    mobile  .
several times the pre    loaded apps have significantly degraded my performance  .
personally , and i realize many people wo not mind this at all going on in the background , to me it's not worth it  .
i'm going to look into trading this in for something else , or just biting the bullet and paying to break my contract and go with a service provider that respects their customers more than to force them to choke on all this bloatware .
this is my third g2 and i will not be getting this one replaced with another g2 , i will be getting a different phone  .
i've had nothing but problems with the g2  .
the screen resolution looks very good , it is a fast phone and the keyboard is nice  .
however , none of these things matter when all three of the phones i've had so far constantly glitch out , turn themselves off over and over again until i pull the battery out  .
i've also experienced a screen with a picture of the phone and a large red triangle with an exclamation point in the middle of it  .
applications also glitch while opening and close regularly , and i also receive forced close messages all of the time i'm sure there are plenty of g2's out there that function properly , but i've had three that have all had serious issues  .
so i cannot recommend this phone at all .
THE LOOK , FEEL , SPEED , KEYBOARD mostly , PRODUCTIVITY , AND ITS ANDROID; I AM SITTING HERE TRYING TO THINK OF SOMETHING THAT HAS NOT BEEN SAID ALREADY .......OK 3 MIN. I GUESS I WOULD SAY I WISH YOU COULD GET RID OF APPS YOU DON'T WANT AND THE BATTERY TO ME IS FAIR. BUT THATS JUST ME
Great Keyboard, Super Fast, Bright Display, Great Call Quality and Clarity, Good Signal Strength, Feels Solid; Nothing Really, HTC Should Have Made A Dedicated Number Row But That's It
Voice texting, emailing, dialing is awesome... might take a revision or two but overall, great!; None yet (delivered 10.27.10).
Great Resolution...very quick data transmission; QWERTY KEYBOARD! Too thick with dimensions. Difficult to put a gel cover on, etc...
800 MHz Qualcomm MSM7230 processor, Battery Life, Froyo, Google Apps, Wifi reception, 3G reception, browsing experience, build quality, keyboard, track pad, USB charging port; USB port placement, speaker sound quality and volume, no front facing camera, no HSPA+ network indication.
Blazing Fast. Perfect Size. Rock Solid. Pure Android. Camera Button. KeyBoard. Z Hinge is Awesome; All the location features on at once like GPS, Places, Weather, will drain the battery.
- Fast Processor. - Solid Feel. - Great Battery Life!. - HSPA+ = Very fast browsing. - Great Camera (BRIGHT Flash). - Large, Responsive, and Beautiful Touch Screen.. - Great Call Quality. - Greatly improved battery/Sim door (from G1); - Track pad (too small to be useful). - No root access? (yet.. :p). - Volume controls are easy to accidentally toggle
Fast Browsing Capability!. Good Screen/Virtual Keyboard Response. Loud Speaker. Awesome Google Navigation, Maps, Chat. Great Handset Volume During Phonecalls. Voice Command; Tinny Sound of Speaker. Dark Screen in the Sunlight. Heavy, Bulky. No Wifi Calling Capability Just Yet
All my communications in one device. Great physical keyboard. Substancial feel; Sensitive hinge that can be blocked easily even by the protective case T-Mobile sells for it.
Fantastic batter life. Very fast processor. Fast internet (HSPA +). Solid, well built phone (hinge has not been a problem at all thus far); Yet to be determined.
Great feel, solid. Excellent Camera, Great Display with lots of memory; Have to control apps a bit to get good battery life.
Blazing fast phone. Hspa Network works great. Android 2.2, Physical Keyboard and great battery life!; Hinge is not be best.
- Quality design. - Stock Andoird 2.2, no custom UI. - Fast response, HSPA+ fast browsing. - One of the best keyboards ever. - Manageable battery life; - No wi-fi hotspot or tethering available at launch. - No wi-fi calling at launch. - hinge issues reported
I love android, and I love the thinness of this phone. AWESOME KEYBOARD!; I do not like the cursor on the front, and I do not like the first look of the phone.
Attractive frame; superfast 4G or WiFi; great browser; stable operating system; very good phone function; Tons of Google crap; forced to sync with the "cloud" rather than syncing with Outlook locally; tiny email fonts (an Android issue)
Feels solid, enjoy the experience on the upgraded t-mobile network. Keyboard is easy to use and love Swype!!; Lacks Tethering/mobile hot spot.
Super fast internet connection, fairly easy tethering with PDA Net, Android OS is good, responsive, huge screen, slide out keyboard, easy battery removal, solid construction; Heavy, bulky, annoying Tmobile zones browser, battery life drains quickly when watching Youtube, huge screen large form factor - sticks out of my gym shorts shallower pocket, can acts as wifi router
- Easy to use keyboard. - call quality is great. - Great integration with Google Apps. - Fast data speeds (varies); - No hot-spot. - A little bulky. - The HSPA+ network not available in all locations
Good size, good keyboard, faster than any phones I've used, including the galaxy S. Stock android. :); placement of usb port, tinny speaker, no pinch to zoom on mobile websites, cannot get rid of unwanted apps which take up nearly all of the built in memory, Z hinge, heavy.
Fast app switching, Large screen, classy design; I've had this phone since the second day it was available. I was assured the hinge was solid. Several weeks later now the top slice of the phone rocks back and forth between the upper left and lower right corners. Also, pre-installed apps must stay
Id say the size is the only pro i can think off.; The first problems i noticed on the new g2 is that it gets pretty dam hot at times almost too hot too hold. I also noticed the speaker phone sound very tinty almost like the speaker sounded blown. Also is disconnects calls. Also the phone is heavy.
Awesome screen. Android's latest software (but then, the competition can upgrade theirs too); Hinge is very weak and won't hold the screen up!. Keyboard is awkward to use and no longer lights up. Exposed wire behind screen. SD card slot UNDER battery
Clean Android 2.2 OS. Breathtakingly beautiful screen. Excellent battery life. Qwerty keyboard and Swype (choices). Very sturdy.; Nothing... except I am not a big fan of gray... I really wish it was available in black
swypeee. decent call quality. awesome screen; awkward keyboard hard to type if u dont have long fingers. screen keeps freezing up on me and will stay that way for a good 30 to 45 mins. a lil bit heavy... takes some getting used to
Fast, configurable, solid, classy design...beginning to love swype. It's the German car of cell phones...; It's a little on the heavy side, charger port location, battery life, speakerphone is a bit raspy.
When it works, the phone is fast and the screen looks great.; The phone is constantly glitching, and the phone shuts itself off quite regularly. The applications constantly force close or open for a split second and then shut themselves down.
I loved this phone for the first 16 days I had it; Until it fell on the floor not even that hard and the screen is completely broken; not cracked, just the LCD screen is now gray/black.
awesome battery life, great build quality, nice screen, google maps/navigation, quick..it doesn't stop; Sometimes restarts on its own, memory not as stated. Don't let the whole "loose hinge" outcry scare you, I've had two g2 and they haven't had the problem. Texting on your back in bed not a problem. It may be a problem if you're walking upside down.
Too many to SAY! Fast HSPA+ network, great web browsing, fast speed overall.; Interface can be convoluted, no HTC specific widgets. Sound quality for music pretty average, video quality is good but not great. Keyboard is awkward coming from the awesome Touchpro2 keyboard.
Beatiful Screen, Fast Processor, Amazing Keyboard,Great Camera, Really Fast, Testing easy,PHONE FEELS SO PREMIUM!!!!!!!!!!; Screen not as good as galaxy s but then again no other phone is, Come with some extra software but if you can afford this phone you can afford an SD card and with one the extra software doesnt take up that much memory, no tethering or hotspot
swype. the touch screen works soooo good. customizable. a good phone if you dont talk on it much; the call quality is TERRIBLE idk if i got a deffective one or what cuz no one else has mentioned that the call quality is very poor its so tingy thats the only thing im extremely disappointed about
The live wallpapers and Andriod 2.2 make this so much better than the Vibrant. It is very well put together, does not have that cheap plastic feel like the vibrant.; Thinness, the hinge could be a problem later, but that is what the warranty is for.
Keypad is smaller, takes getting used to but so efficient...speed of software load &#38; download with 4G network is amazing...screen's nice &#38; clear &#38; camera is quite usable.Car mode is helpful &#38; voice to text is amazingly usueful. Google apps; As cool as the flip upstyle, i just hope it doesn;t break easy...and would have loved a slight rubbery feel around to avoid teh phone slipping as it is nicely brushed.
- Fast HSPA+, where available.. - Good to better reception.. - Great design.. - Great camera (it has a flash!). - Android Market is comparable to iTunes App store, plus they allow installation of "non-sanctioned" apps.. - More!; - No official tethering or mobile hotspot, although Android 2.2 is capable of them.. - Not many accessories.. - Bad periphery buttons and ports placement.. - Beware of having the correct feature in your T-Mobile account.. - NO PC/MAC SYNCHRONIZATION!!!!!
The camera takes excellent pictures. I like the build quality even though it is a bit heavy..Trackpad works well..Great call quality..The internet is super fast..And I love Froyo of course!; I wish it had more internal memory...I'm also not sure about the keyboard hinge thing...I guess we will see how it works out after a few months of use.
The screen, hinge, keyboard, etc., are all beautiful and seem to work well, it's an amazing piece of engineering.; T-Mobile weighs these down with so much pre-loaded software that you can't stop, can't remove, can't even root, which degrades the performance and is a huge distraction.
Superb hardware. Blazing fast CPU. Beautiful screen. Android 2.2. "4g"; Z-hinge works fine, but I don't think it's the most piratical thing. Also, I wish there were only 2 quick keys and a bigger space bar that is raised a little more. That's the only part of the keyboard I don't like
Phone is super fast, like the voice action feature on the phone I did run a speedtest in the denver metro area and I got 5.7 mbs in my house on wifi I go 13.6 mbs,; the quality of the picture compare with other phone like galaxy s or the I phone retina display.
screen size, display, android 2.2, speed, physical keyboard, call quality, multi touch, weight of phone and it's solid looks, update all feature,; speaker a bit but its still good, music player is classic, charging port location its really hard to operate while charging, google apps should be optional we cannot remove it.
Fast, solid, google maps, free/paid apps that rock, froyo and browser with flash. Easy default app change, big screen. Google voice.; Battery life, battery life and battery life. Battery runs really hot especially when on the web. Google bloatware. No way to permanently delete carrier installed crapware which takes up a crapload of memory. Google owns you.
wonderful screen. Fast 4g speeds. Flash player. I know some people don't like the weight of the phone but I like it. Feels like a quality phone. z-hinge is interesting. And I love the fact that it is purely an android platform.; I don't like that the numbers on the key board don't have there own dedicated keys.
Beautiful design, sturdy and heavy, beautiful super lcd screen, great feeling keyboard, as fast as any phone i've used via HSPA+, big plus for its bluetooth connectivity.; Using this Z Hinge takes a little getting use to. Prefer better placement of the microSD Card. External or something similar to the MyTouch Slide.
this pure android the way Google intended it to be no sense or motoblur. super fast, perfect size screen, and the best keyboard to date. the hot spot or tethering but t-mobile says it's a future update to come; no front facing camera, android system takes up alot of battery
Super fast, 2.2 android, great looking, best keyboard i've used, beautiful screen, idk if people got bad phones or what but so far my z-hinge is solid.; a bit on the heavy side, my takes a bit to get use to the zhinge slide thing.. other then that its a great phone.
Android rocks. Internet Access rocks. If I can't get the APP no problem, use the web. Let's me finally pull everything together in one place. Gotta have an actual keyboard. On screen is cool, SWYPE rocks. iPhone who? And no DRM.; I can't find a pouch that will fit my phone with the gel cover on it. Gotta have the gel cover, dropped it the first time I opened the keyboard.
The slide out key board on the G2 was the best I have seen. The phone felt solid in my hand and felt like it could take a beating. The Vibrant looked like it would explode if it was dropped. Text senders will adore it.; It's too heavy. The Samsung Vibrant looked like a better choice for me. While I was in the store a customer came into return a G2 while she was still on her two week grace period. She was did not realize how heavy it was until she got it home.
I love the design. This phone is fast, I'm coming from a Nexus One. And this baby is definitely faster. It dosent have amoled sreen like the nexus one. But it's a great screen very bright and clear. The sound is good. I love stock android. Track pad; Not really a con. But I wonder can the hinges hold for years to come. Only time will tell.
Great build quality. Keyboard is the best I've used since my Blackberry. Screen quality is amazing. 800mhz processor is fast. Good battery life. Android 2.2 out of the box.; May be too heavy for some (although I enjoy the substance). No movie preloaded on it like the HD2 and Vibrant :(
This phone is very solid. Feels perfect in hands. I love the google maps and navigation. Really cool. g-chat preloaded. keyboard is NICE (although i agree about quick keys.) sync with facebook and google contacts seamlessly.; ONLY 2GB internal storage! another issue I have is the difficulty in organizing my contacts. If I have a contact from google AND Facebook, can't link them. Unable to edit facebook contacts. The screen wobbles everytime i touch it while open.
I like the fact that it is android not a regular smartphone. The screen is very vibrant and clear with 4 different ways of texting. The outer exterior is very stylish as well. I think T-Mobile did a great job.; I didn't like the way the phone would hang, looking like it would fall off. Although T-Mobile stated that it is very durable I had to count that fact in.
4g makes online radio and streaming youtube a joy. I love the feel of the phone and the Android interface is amazing as always. I will never go back to my jailbroken Iphone again. The phone is much faster than my wifes hd2 (jb with android 2.2); I wish it had dedicated number keys on the physicial keyboard.
Pros: Exceptional quality and solid feel. Keyboard is the best I've used yet.. Touch screen quality is clear &#38; responsive. The 800mhz processor is fast &#38; the battery life is better than any phone I have seen. It's fun to use and intuitive.; I am being picky because all phones with touch screens are hard to read in the sun, but solving this issue is on my wish list.
Super fast and easy to understand especially coming from using a blackberry. The customizable screen is also a big plus. Great video quality and picture quality also. The G2 also comes with a flash player.; One of the the few cons i have of this phone is the slightly confusing keyboard which takes a minute to get familiar with. Also once your contacts are synced from Facebook you can not edit them which was also a little off putting.
comes with google voice and other google apps, when downloading apps you can save them on your sd card, the phone feels heavy and well made, froyo 2.2, great keyboard, easy to take off battery cover, HSPA+ capable,...; you can not delete the google apps you don't use, touch screen is not the best or worst, low amount of internal memory, I had to glue my ear to the phone to hear the caller on the other end, hinge is iffy, to many signal options, (E, G, R, H)....
1. Great battery life. It's been 24 hours since I unplugged my phone. I still have 32% remaining.. 2. Stock android. 3. Zippy. 4. Love the keyboard. Wasn't used to one before (iphone user). 5. I get data at an avg of 7Mb/s down.; 1. The hinge is a bit loose, but It doesn't really affect me at all. I don't pick up the phone by holding just the sides with two fingers. I don't type upside down. Perhaps it's because I'm not spiderman.
The phone is a premium device, and feels that way the moment you touch any part of it. The stainless steel lends to a great feel for the phone. The performance has excelled compared to my Nexus One. It feels smoother in day to day operation.; I wish T Mobile did not remove the wi-fi tethering feature found on the N1. I also wish all of the Google branded apps were not pre-bundled wirth the phone. I don't use Google Earth, and I have no interest in it taking up so much storage space.
