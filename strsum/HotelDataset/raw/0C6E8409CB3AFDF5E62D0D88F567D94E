heritage house was the primary location used in the 1978 film “same time next year” with alan alda and ellen burstyn .
i have always loved this time travel romantic comedy and it had been a longtime goal of mine to visit heritage house where the movie was filmed .
the shell of a cottage here at heritage house was used in shooting the exterior portions of the film .
that cottage was built on a temporary foundation overlooking the pacific ocean .
according to wiki , after filming was completed , universal paid for the shell to be relocated to a permanent foundation and the interior was outfitted with the studio furnishings .
the cottage became a popular romantic getaway , so popular in fact that the heritage house eventually partitioned the cottage in half and added a second bathroom to the opposite end .
one half of the cottage was called `` same time '' and the other half called `` next year '' .
a gazebo sits on a point overlooking the ocean where , as memory serves me , there was a bench where alda and burstyn sat .
dave and i walked out to the point at night and again in the morning to experience the romantic setting for ourselves taking our time to stroll the bluffs high above the ocean .
we had dinner in the resort’s main dining room but the food and service did not live up to its expensive “farm to fork” cuisine promise .
but our room couldn’t have . . .

but our room couldn’t have been nicer with a private porch view of the ocean , working fireplace , heated stone floors in the spacious bathroom and a comfortable bed , we were more than pleased.
