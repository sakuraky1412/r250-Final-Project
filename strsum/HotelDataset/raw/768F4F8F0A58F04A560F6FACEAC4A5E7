i decided to stay at this guesthouse on the basis of the tripadvisor reviews i 'd read .
i booked by email , and quickly received an email back confirming my reservation - which was honoured despite my late arrival at 11:30pm .
the staff speak spanish , english , french and german .
the guesthouse is beautiful , with decent rooms that have good showers/wc , air conditioning , and even a number-operated safe .
there 's a common area ( as seen in the photos ) with a few tables .
the breakfasts that are served are very generous ( which is something you 'll grow to expect in cuba ) with coffee , juice , fruit salad , omelette , bread , honey , etc .
the hostel is right at the heart of the old town , and just a five minute walk away from the piaza vieja , and much of the old town .
and it 's a five minute walk during which you feel completely safe walking around - even at night .
the staff were very friendly and helpful , and initially gave me advice on how to get around havana , where to go , what to do , etc .
they then organised a shared taxi for me to get to viñales ( door-to-door ) , the accommodation there , and gave me a list of recommended places to stay for the duration of my holiday in cuba .
highly recommended for anyone , including first-time travellers to cuba .
the only drawback for people travelling on their own and looking to meet other travellers is that with only five rooms , this . . .
