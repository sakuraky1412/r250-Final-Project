we got sent to the ionian park after our evening flight was cancelled so we had to stay in korfu overnight .
everything was handled efficiently by the reception staff , 50+ people were given rooms - ours was on 2nd floor , very clean and had a nice view of the pool area and sea , `` all inclusive '' armbands and information about meals and drinks , and by the time we dropped off our suitcases and went for dinner , restaurant staff was working hard and made sure there was food for all of us .

we were offered free drinks in the bar for 2 hours too but the choice was very limited and if you wanted cocktails the bartender made something up on the spot as `` special cocktail '' .
ours was blue , had gin and curacao in it and did n't taste too bad .
so far so good , but there is one very important reason that ionian park must get a terrible rating from me .
i have stayed in $ 5 hostels in developing countries , but the beds at ionian park were more uncomfortable than any bed i have slept on before .

my view is that it is simply not possible to wake up after a night in this hotel without feeling pain in at least a few different places .
therefore , avoid .
at least until they have replaced all of their mattresses.
