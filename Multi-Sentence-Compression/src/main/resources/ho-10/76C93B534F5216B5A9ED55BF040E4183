my 5 night stay cost over $ 2200 , upon check in i was asked for a card ( as expected ) the lady told me they would take the full rate plus $ 400 for any extras added to the room ( refundable if i did n't use it ) .
i 've stayed in many hotels across the usa and never had the full amount of a room rate put on hold and if a hotel has taken a $ 100 per night extra for room service they have refunded on the day of check out .
when i complained about this they said it was standard procedure and that it was hotel policy to take the full rate as a pre-authorisation !
i filled out the form , sent a copy of my credit card details , billing address etc then only to find out it was the wrong form and that i would have to sort out the customs forms myself .
as if realising i was out $ 2000+ for nearly 2 weeks my fiancee realised she left her laptop in the safety deposit box .
on check out i signed my invoice and agreed that my full total was $ 2200 plus any extras from the mini bar .
apparently i was in the wrong for using a debit card !
the stay was ok , the hotel is in a good location , the rooms are quite spacious for new york .
the hotel had charged me $ 2600 on check in and $ 2200 on check out !
luckily i had a relative living in new york that picked it up for me .
