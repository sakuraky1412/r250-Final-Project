$$;
Pros:. BLACKEST OF BLACKS CREATES A PALATE OF COLOR, GAMMA, DIMENSION, AND THE ABILITY TO FURTHER THIS STATE OF THE ART PICTURE WITH ISF, TO GREATER HEIGHTS. EASY ON THE EYES, TONS OF CONTROLS AND SETTINGS TO MAKE THE MOST SUBTLE CHANGES POSSIBLE.. 
Cons:. STILL LOOKING.. 
Summary:. I OWNED THE FIRST PIONEER PRO-FHD1. IN IT'S DAY IT WAS THE STANDARD FOR ALL HD TELEVISION TO BE JUDGED, IN 2004 ELECTRONIC PRODUCT OF THE YEAR BY EVERYONE WHO REVIEWED IT, AND IT SOLD FOR A COOL $10K. I LOVED THE COLOR'S AND IT'S ABILITY TO CREATE THE MOST DIMENSIONAL OF PICTURE'S I HAD EVER SEEN.. NOW IT'S 2008 AND PIONEER IS CALLING IT QUITS IN THE R&#38;D AND MANUFACTURING OF ALL PLASMA DISPLAYS. I HAD READ REVIEWS ON THE KURO 9TH GEN PRO-151FD AND AGAIN ALL THE REVIEWS POINTED TO THE BEST OBTAINABLE (STATE OF THE ART)DISPLAY AS THE HAD BACK IN 2004. I LIVE NEAR THE SO.CAL. PIONEER STORE AND HAD THE PRO-151FD DEMOED. I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW BLACK, BLACK COULD BE. THE PROBLEM OF THE BARS ON CERTAIN ASPECT RATIOS, GONE. 60'' &#38; THE BARS AS BLACK AS INK, FOR ME THIS WAS BIG. I COULD NOW ENJOY ALL THE 2.35 BD'S I HAD PURCHASED OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS I HAVE ALL WAYS BEEN A BIT SKEPTICAL ABOUT DEMOS, BE THEY AUDIO OR VIDEO. AFTER THE DEMO OF THE PRO-151FD I WAS TAKEN TO THE LOBBY OF THE STORE TO SEE A COMPARISON OF 50" VS 60" WOW, I GOTTA HAVE THE 60"! THIS DISPLAY WAS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE DISPLAY DEMOED, WITH REMOTE IN HAND I WANTED TO SEE IF THIS WAS ISF DAY OR NIGHT, AND TO MY SURPRISE THE DISPLAY WAS SET TO OPTIMIZE ON THE AV SELECTION. I INQUIRED AS TO THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF THIS SELECTION AND I WAS TOLD WITH OUT PAYING FOR THE DISPLAY TO ISF THIS IS THE PICTURE WE WOULD HAVE AT HOME. THAT DID IT. I WENT HOME AFTER GETTING PRICED FROM PIONEER AND MADE A FEW CALLS AND THE REST IS HISTORY. WE KNOW OWN TWO OF THE GREATEST DISPLAYS AVAILABLE TO DATE.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simply the best blu ray experience one can imagine. Components: SONY blu ray ES5000, Monster HDMI 1000, Audionet Map V2 / AMP VII (see audionetusa.com) loudspeakers Wilson Benesch's Discovery, ARCs.breath taking. No need to buy another TV after this!. 
Cons:. None. Really can't think of any. It's so beyond the other brands I tested, it's not funny.. 
Summary:. Would buy this TV if it would cost twice as much - it's that good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent black level detail, and contrast. Very good to excellent color saturation and accuracy.. 
Cons:. True shame that pioneer is no longer making these tv's. Wish they made a 32 or 40 inch model I would be all over it.. 
Summary:. Black levels ! very impressive, I am a very critical viewer and have installed, calibrated, and owned some of the very best in projectors and TV displays and have always been disapointed with the black levels. I have to say this tv I am very impressed and pleased with. Colors are very good to excellent, not the best Ive seen but very good. I have not had mine ISF calibrated yet but have spent much time calibrating it with the use of Joe Kanes blue ray version of video essentials and believe I have it dialed in. Highly recommended and especially for the price they are going for. I have installed more expensive tv's the Runco (which is a modified and hand picked pioneer elite) and find this to be every bit as good.. Cant say enough about this set, dont hesitate buy one you wont be disapointed worth every penny. Nothing comes close for the price. Enjoy. 

$$;
Pros:. Georgeous picture, true colors, deep blacks, and very easy to manage and adjust.. 
Cons:. A little expensive, and sometimes slow to respond. 

$$;
Pros:. The best picture I have ever seen. I go to other homes with plasmas and the pictures are not the same. 
Cons:. I love everything. 
Summary:. Spend the money for the quality, I love sports and I can see the sweat and pores on the faces when watching movies or sports. I normally don't take time to write reviews but this was worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful black levels, gorgeous colors, nice glossy black frame, plenty of hdmi connects and detachable speakers and stand.. 
Cons:. Pricey, but worth every cent if you can afford it! SD channels good, but not great. Pioneer out of TV business.. 
Summary:. I always heard that Pioneer made the best plasma TVs, so I pulled the trigger on the 60 inch Kuro Elite. One of the best decisions I ever made. I detached the speakers and stand to hang this baby on the wall (my preference). Blu Ray movies look stunning!!!! The HD cable channels are gorgeous, even though the SD channels leave something to be desired. If you can afford this, it is a must have! Too bad Pioneer is going out of business. Also, I hired professionals to calibrate and install the TV to the wall. Well worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. EASY TO NAVIGATE FUNCTIONS - UNBELIVABLE PICTURE. 
Cons:. PRICE - EVEN DISCOUNTED ITS STILL TOO HIGH - I PAID LESS FOR MY FIRST CAR!. 
Summary:. WELL WORTH THE MONEY - BEST PICTURE EVER - CANT WAIT TILL ITS ISF CALIBRATED. SLICK DESIGN - LOOKS GREAT EVEN TURNED OFF.". Shop around for best Price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reference level display of high-quality 1080p source material - ie. Blu-ray Disc - in a consumer display. Unequalled black levels and astounding dynamic contrast provide superior image depth and realism, enhancing the willing suspension of disbelief.. 
Cons:. Uninformative documentation written in marketing-speak.. Very heavy, be careful choosing furniture/mounting.. Hungrily slurps down electricity when turned on. Much more energy efficient when in standby.. 
Summary:. This is simply the best television available today, no other direct-view television comes close now, or is likely to in the near future. We recently upgraded our Kuro to the 60" PRO 151FD from the 50" PRO 111FD. The screen is a lot bigger - the math says its 44% larger in fact. Here is my take on the 151 and some comparisons to it's smaller sibling.. * Brightness is sufficient for a room with considerable ambient light.. * Refresh speed and motion resolution are excellent - none of the motion blur artifacts common to LCD screens.. * To my untrained eye, color accuracy, greyscale and gamma are good out of the box in accurate "Pure" mode and promise to be excellent with professional calibration.. * De-interlacing and scaling is good but not excellent. Noise reduction is very good. Just like on the 50", 720p looks soft, implicating the internal scaling, not just the large screen size.. * Displays 24fps at the native frame rate. Though not an advertised, accepts both 50Hz PAL and 60Hz NTSC to display at native frame-rate.. * "Pure Cinema" has been a source of considerable confusion. This setting is not properly explained in the manual, which uses obscure marketing speak that tells you absolutely nothing. This is what the settings have been confirmed to do:. o"Standard": The "source direct" mode. For 1080p24fps materials, it displays at 72Hz using 3:3 pulldown. For interlaced signals (480i and 1080i), traditional 3:2 pulldown detection is applied to display at 60Hz. Leaves (480p, 720p and 1080p) at 60Hz untouched.. o"Smooth": Uses motion interpolation to build intermediate frames. Not active on 1080p60 sources.. o"Advanced": Like "Standard" mode, Displays 1080p24fps materials at 72Hz using 3:3 pulldown. Performs Inverse Telecine (recreates original 24 frames) when film-based video cadence detected to display 72Hz using 3:3 pulldown. Results vary depending on the quality of the source. Not active on 1080p60 sources.. o"Off": 24fps material is displayed at 60Hz using 3:2 pulldown. Film cadence detection is disabled.. * Standard definition processing yields acceptable results through HDMI depending on the quality of the source. Noise reduction options are effective with minimal loss of detail. Highly compressed standard definition sources (e.g. cable) don't make good viewing at this screen size.. * Internal scaling of non-native resolution sources isn't as good as external solutions. Compressed 720 (ABC, ESPN, output at the native resolution) can be pretty soft. Compared to 720p, a Denon 2930 delivers a similar level of detail from PAL DVD upscaled to 1080p. While the Oppo BDP-83's ABT solution is not as strong as the Denon's Reon-based scaling, both are easily better at deinterlacing/scaling DVD test patterns and reference materials than the internal processor.. * Zoom modes are fairly useful. Non-linear stretch mode has a very high level of overscan, making SD materials look even worse.. * Image retention is simply not an issue with sensible viewing. We've not done any sort of "break-in" procedure as suggested in some corners of the internet but we have kept the contrast lower than normal - around 35. Yes, we occassionally pause a BD/DVD and leave the room. We've watched lot's of material in the original aspect ratio with black letterboxes in the first 100 hours. No issues.. * Design: The Bezel of the 151 is slightly larger than the 111 and the stand is of a more robust construction to support the weight - over 100 lbs. The 111, if you can still find one, definitely has sleeker lines but both are elegant when off.. * Built-in Home Media Gallery (DNLA) will display photos, play MP3s from a computer or media server over your network. File support is limited - AAC/FLAC/Apple Lossless files will not play. Great for photos - probably not the most usable solution for Music/Video.. * Our PRO 151 is used as a monitor only so the included speakers are not attached. I can't comment on the sound quality.. Review rig consists of: Oppo BDP-83, Denon 2930, SA 8300HD (Comcast), HDMI pass-through Denon 2308.. I would say that this television actually has a better picture than it's younger sibling but that may be idiosyncatic - each plasma displays some individuality, if you'll pardon the pun. Our PRO 151 shows better brightness uniformity, better color and seems less noisy than the PRO 111 it replaced. We got our 151 at cost well below the lowest advertised on cnet. If you live in the DC area, the folks at Myer-Emco come with my strongest recommendation for buying AV gear - these guys offer great deals, unparalleled customer service and after-purchase care.. 

$$;
Pros:. Limitless as far as tweaking the picture. 
Cons:. It makes me watch more TV than normal.. 
Summary:. I love the pc hookup and all the features especially pro-calibration features, simply stunning with the correct sources. I really love watching hockey and bb in HD on this thing. blu Ray movies are stunning to say the least.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very clear and true to life picture quality. The colors are intense, but accurate and the blacks are the best I have scene. There is very little reflection in the screen from outside light sorces, like a window. Once the tv is on you don't see them.. 
Cons:. The only complaint is the appearance of artifacts in dealing with movement of objects when the signal is too compressed. The best picture this tv displays is from an antenna digital signal completely uncompressed, like an NFL game broadcasted in HD.. 
Summary:. If you want the biggest 'Bang for Your Buck' the Kuro 151fd plasma is the only way to go. I connected my 151 to the Pioneer Elite SC-05 receiver and a set of Bose speakers with a REL subwoofer for an entertainment experience that is second to none. What I like best is there no chance for pixilation with plasma like there is in an LCD screen The pioneer equipment works very well with one another. I have no complaints with this product. You experience some artifacts of movement in the screen when the signal is too compressed; for example, Verizon FIOS. This is the best 1080p picture you can get in a television. Why would you stop making plasma televisions Pioneer????? My advice is to grab a 111fd or the 151fd while they last.. 

$$;
Pros:. magnificently /natural/ picture; huge image that covers much of one's field of vision; lots of inputs, plus extras on the left side; plain cosmetics do not draw attention to themselves. 
Cons:. wretchedly crappy user manual; shallow learning curve on user interface; remote control hard to read in dim light (backlighting notwithstanding); expensive; manufacturer leaving TV business. 
Summary:. I had no intention of purchasing this set right now, intending to wait at least another year. But when it was bruited about that Pioneer was getting out of the TV business, and HFC offered a three-year zero-interest loan, I bit.. My video standards are very high, and I expected the PRO-151FD to meet them. It didn't. It was /better/ than I'd expected.. I started with "Amadeus" (on a Sony BD-S550). The dark scenes weren't so hot, but when the movie got to the day-lit court scenes, my jaw hit the floor. Tremendous detail, but without exaggeration. Vivid colors (where appropriate), but without them "popping". It was much like looking a huge photograph that moved. Or perhaps seeing the thing itself, in 2D.. "Ratatouille", with all its incredible detail, was almost as good. "Sleeping Beauty" finally revealed what the Disney artists were trying to do. Even "7th Voyage of Sinbad" looked (mostly) fine, the skeleton duel being especially impressive.. I paid $6K, plus sales tax and delivery, and it was worth every stinking penny. Don't "vidition" this set unless you have the money. It is to die for.. Updated. on Apr 17, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Beeeautifulll picture! Especially if you have BluRay hooked to it! I'm using a PS3.You'll be hard pressed to find a better TV, Samsung don't even come close.. 
Cons:. Addiction to watching it, cannot find enough BluRay movies fast enough. BUt I still have to get this pro calibrated.... 
Summary:. I got the 151FD PRO Elite. The big problem? I look down at other TVs...sad I know...but if you have the means to get this, bite the bullet and go for it. No buyer's remorse or anything!. 

$$;
Pros:. Backlit remote; sleek design; easy menus to navigate; fantastic picture quality. 
Cons:. Not enough component inputs. With several non-upgradable devices attached to the TV, not everything can go HDMI, so more component inputs (YGB) would be ideal.. 
Summary:. I love the overall product, but am somewhat disappointed with the lack of component connections. Can't recall offhand if there's a USB connection. There should be, if there isn't.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best picture I've ever seen.. 
Cons:. Price. Um, that's it.. 
Summary:. If you want the best TV and you've got the dough, you won't go wrong with this set.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best Black Levels. PURE mode is flawless. thin sleek look. fine picture detail. 
Cons:. pricey. remote control is kind of junky. 
Summary:. this is truly the Best TV on the market. If you are looking for the best possible TV experience this does not disappoint. This TV goes beyond what you thought you could see in a TV and achieves a color and blackness that never existed before. It is a hefty investment but it will be the best TV in that size for at least then next 5 years. (OLED will rival the quality and picture abilities, but those wont be available at a reasonable price in the next 5 years. Overall, if you have the means for purchasing this TV you will not be dissapointed.. BTW you do see an increase in picture quality if you use pioneer products with them (bluray in particular.). If you can afford an ICE series (SC) def.. if not the VSX-03TXH works great. Eventhough the BDP-05FD is pricey at list $800, and its only profile 1.1, its still excellent. You do get what you pay for and the processor quality and built in HD sound processors really make the bluray worth it. If your not going to use the online features then the 05FD is great (better than the S550 PQ wise).. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is eye-popping; the controls allow a wide variety of settings; deep blacks; lots of inputs (4 HDMI); seems to generate minimal heat radiation.. 
Cons:. A high price, but I bought it at $4999.95 (list:$6500) so it was well worth the price.. 
Summary:. The gloss black stand and bezel give it a very classy look; the picture is outstanding with crystal clear picture when using blu-ray player and very deep blacks; room ambient light and color sensor; myriad of adjustable settings; lots of inputs (only one component, if you have a lot of "legacy" equipment); nice sturdy remote. This is my first foray into plasma and certainly the biggest TV in the houre. I replaced a second-generation Samsung DLP 61" with this, and there is no comparison. It is amazing watching blu-ray movies on this TV, and regular HD cable programs and movies are also stunning. I have yet to notice a lot of heat coming off the back of the panel as I have with other TVs in the stores. You could probably spend over $10,000 for a Runco or other "prestige" TV and not surpass the performance of this panel. I was trying to decide between this and the Panasonic 58" plasma and took the plunge. I'm sure the Panasonic would have been great as it looked comparable (but not the same!) in the store, but am totally happy with this panel. I heartily recommend this TV if you can get it at a discount as I did.. 

$$;
Pros:. Over stated but Black Blacks!. Vibrant colors. Excellant contrast. 
Cons:. Heavy. The remote is poorly design and can be tempermental. It seems to have a problem displaying credits some times, but many TVs are worst.. Expensive. 
Summary:. If you can afford this and are considering it, I say go buy it today.. I have used it with everything from poor quality youtube videos to blu-ray and it makes everything look better. The only TV I saw that even came close was Pioneer's 6020FD which I was about to buy, but after I saw the 151FD I had to have it. If you are a total video adjusting nut you can buy one of there signature monitors for 500 dollars more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Colours, Blacks, Sharpness, Refresh rate. Truly an awesome product. 
Cons:. Heavy to hang and lift. 
Summary:. Love the product, have had some great nights in watching movies and sport.. 

$$;
Pros:. Near perfect colors, ability to tweak further if necessary. Black with details that you didn?t know you were missing because they are not there on other sets. This Plasma enhances a poor 480 pic to produce a pic that looks like a 720 or 1080 input.. 
Cons:. $6500 price &#38; you will spend too much time watching TV. May cause marital problems becoming more critical if she finds out what U paid for that thing hanging on the wall. (If she finds out the price it can b a great addition to your new bachelor pad). 
Summary:. This is the last year that Pioneer will produce their own panels. Begining in 2009 the panels will be produced by Panasonic so I chose to buy now. After months of research and shopping, comparing Panasonic, Pioneer and Hitachi I decided to go for broke and buy the Pioneer Elite. There is not good information on the difference between Pioneer and the Pioneer Elite series (not even from Pioneer) both use the same panel. The Elite gives you an additional year warranty, additional color controls and the consistent statement ?hand-picked components? but no information what that means.. Every store I shopped, I compared the Elite Series to the base Pioneer and the Elite always showed better than the base set. I have never seen either of these Plasmas displayed by a retailer in a way that does them justice. When you are shopping for a flat panel television the bright sets with very sharp edges jump out as the best because they compete with the fluorescent lighting used by the retailer. When you get the sets home it is a different story. The bright sets are to bright, the enhancements that create the sharp edges become annoying because they are not natural. The blacks are grey and dark grey, the colors are bright but not true. The Pioneer sets have blacks that match the Piano Black finish of the frame and a realistic natural picture that is as real as it gets. Again a picture that seems you could reach out and touch everything on the screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Deepest blacks ever achieved. Ruler flat greyscale. Near perfect Color points.. Best contrast on the market. Unbeatable. 
Cons:. Price is a little high. 
Summary:. This is the best TV ever made.. You simply can't do better.. This Tv performs well in just about ever single important categorie. something no other TV can do like this one.. I am looking forward to the Sony XBR8 LCD's and the Samsung 950 LCDs, But I do not expect either of them to perfom like this TV. Mark my words.. 

$$;
Pros:. Black is black.. Superb picture--best I've seen. 
Cons:. A bit pricey. Included speakers could be a bit more powerful. you must embrace the darkness. heavy. 
Summary:. This is an amazing HDTV. The setup in Best Buy does no justice to the image quality of this thing. The problem with most big chain stores is the at they never bother to set up TV's like this properly, even in their magnolia home theatre stores. I'm not targeting Best Buy, but this applies to just about every big name electronic store. You never get to see the true nature of this TV, and it makes it seem as though the LCD's are better because of the lighting. But if you see this TV properly set up, you'll be amazed. The black is truly black. The colors really really vibrant. All of this combined produces a really wonderful image.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture. Size. Natural Tones. 
Cons:. Pricey. Pioneer exiting the TV business. 
Summary:. I think this TV has the best picture I have ever seen.It was not easy to find and I probably paid too much for it. No regrets. I did not have it calibrated. I saw Quantum of Solace on it in the store and the details are stunning. The blacks are truly amazing. I have a Sony LCD 46" and I thought the image was great and actually did not think it could get much better. I saw the Planet Earth Bluray on the Sony and thought it was spectacular but on the Pioneer it was even better. I have seen the Casino Royale Bluray many times but even that movie on the Pioneer allowed me to see details not seen before. The contrasting shades of black and dark gray is where it shines. For casual watching it is best with sports in my opinion. I watched the World Series on hi def cable which I believe is 720p and it looked great and natural which in my opinion was the problem with LCDs. I think the LCD is cheaper but my perception is that movies and TV look like soap operas that is, kind of artificial looking. Just a personal preference. I was a little gunshy given that Pioneer is exiting the TV business but part should be available for 7 years. That may be BS but I took the plunge. I don't regret it . Linked to a good home theater I think you can rest easy that you hav e the best picture possible outside of some very high end systems. No problem with screen burn in although I worry when my nephews will use it for gaming on the PS3! Even my wife who is your typical woman with regards to electronics thinks the picture is spectacular! Did not need to go to the doghouse for this one. Like I said I have not calibrated it and don't see the need yet. Brilliant TV!. 

$$;
Pros:. I was undecided whether I would buy this tv or the Panasonic TH-65PZ850 but I was unable to wait any longer. I expected it to be released in July 08 and I don't think that it has been released still. I wrote to Panasonic and never got an answer.. 
Cons:. Nothing that I have seen nor heard. 
Summary:. It has a beautiful picture, it is in a bright room with 3 windows approximately six feet away from the screen, but on the side not in front. Bright room or dark room it still has a great picture. I am sure you will not regret purchasing this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture Quality, Sound, Pixles, Smoothness.. 
Cons:. Too Expensive.. 
Summary:. This Is a great T.v with great picture and Quality I have had this model for 1 year now. But I must say the new Samsung Series 850 Is better than this model in Picture Quality and Smoothness and its only 3,200$..
