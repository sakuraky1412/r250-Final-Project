Pros:. 1) Great design. 2) User friendly, free software, 3) Excellent video. High capacity for storage (esp. the 120 GB Zune). 4) Functional and easy to use.. 
Cons:. 1) No audiobook add on in the software. That's it. It's cool!. 
Summary:. I love this thing! I've never really appreciated the iPod design, not to mention their proprietary software and iTunes.The Zune still needs to be used with the Microsoft software, but you get that for free and you can get your music anywhere. My Zune has worked flawlessly for three years after I bought it used on Craig's List. I downloaded the Zune software off the internet for free and it automatically synced to my computer. The Zune/Software interface has worked flawlessly as well.... much better than my Sony YP-T9 Software and player. There's few things I don't like about my Zune. I'm going to buy another one here very soon.. 

$$;
Pros:. Like the quality of the audio, wi-fi sync, and of course the social. Who can forget the social its my space meets music fanatic.. 
Cons:. Looks like a brick. Could throw it to anyone and cause massive brain damage.. 
Summary:. Sure the zune is bulky and looks like a brick, but besides that you are getting a premium media player. Which lets you watch your music videos, movies, and podcasts: listen to your beats while working out, sync your music to your zune while your in the garage, and of course play games via the wi-fi against your buddies or shop for music through zune marketplace via your zune. Just buy and sync straight to your zune..

Pros:. i have had my zune for over 2 years now and it works better than ever. you can update the firmware so it it is like you have a new and better zune about every 6 months. twist navigation is fun and easy to use. very easy to use. sound quality is great. 
Cons:. the battery was great in the beginning but after awhile it slowly decreases (you can get a new higher capacity battery for about $10 on ebay) the screen on the original zune is plastic so it will eventually scratch.. 
Summary:. the zune is far better than the ipod in many ways. having a zune makes you stand out from all the ipod hype. the new zunes are even better with glass screens metal bodies and touchpad navigation. get a zune today and give it a chance, you wont be sorry!.

Summary:. I've had my Zune for about 6 months now and I still love it. It has a very durable case (I've dropped it a few times now with no damage), the controls are very intuitive, and the display is beautiful.. I also signed up for the Zune Marketplace. At $15 bucks a month, it's nice to be able to download all you want. I've had little to no trouble finding the music I like. Some music you still have to pay for, but that's a record company thing. I'm hoping my Zune sticks around for a long time..

Pros:. Big Clear Color Screen, Looks Great, Easy to use, Software is so much better then iTunes, and the music subscriptions are great!. 
Cons:. Not enough 3rd Party Accessories, I would love to covert my Bose Sound Station to run my ZUNE!. 
Summary:. First off, I have had my Zune for about 6 months. Why the wait on the review you ask? I wanted to use it for a while and really see how it stacks up to my iPod and write a truly unbiased review of this product based on my experience over time, rather then just after a week or so of use. So based on my 10 out of 10 rating, you can gather that I really love this thing.. So let's start with the software: When I first got my generation II 40G iPod, I had a real hard time with the software, there were many bugs with syncing and just trying to pull existing files over. As most of my 1200 or so albums are on CD's and yes, I still buy CD's as sometimes I like to listen to my music in it's purest form, I rip all my music to my hard drive first, then back it up on my external mass storage device. With the ZUNE software it's a snap, I couldn't ask for an easier user interface, very simple with some customizable options for the more savvy user. With iTunes it's not as easy, especially if you want to use the iTunes software to do the rip, it tends to take a while where with the ZUNE software it's real quick. It's also very easy to move pictures, video clips ect. As soon as the music is done ripping you have album art, dates, genres, ect, you also have the ability to modify the information if you have your own specific genre listings as I like to do as I don't like some of the ones that come up. When moving pictures and videos, the ZUNE software will use the same folder information that you used on the computer so you will be able to search the same way on the ZUNE device itself. Same with Videos, I don't plan to use my ZUNE to watch movies so I can't give you a review on that, I may get another one to do that with or wait until they come out with an 80G and use that one for movies.. The ZUNE Device: I love the fact that it displays the album art of the music you are playing on the screen, I know this seems trivial but I think it's a really cool feature. The screen itself is big and clear and I just love that. The user controls are what you would expect, I really loved the old iPod dial but I think I'm over it, and now like the way the ZUNE controls are set up, but like anything new and a little different, you will get used to it fast. I have read a few reviews that state the battery life is poor, but I don't think it's all that bad, I can fly across the country with a lay over and not have a problem, maybe it's because I'm not watching movies, I get a solid 9-12 hours of play time with just music and a few peeks at some pictures of my daughter. I only have a couple friends who have ZUNE's so my experience with the WiFi feature is limited but it does work nice, especially if I want to beam a couple pictures over. As far as music, it's cool to share some music but the fact that you are only limited to 3 or so listens is pretty crappy. So just throw some music on a memory stick if you want to swap for an extended period of time.. Accessories: The ZUNE itself comes with a nice micro fiber case that is quite durable, mine hasn't ripped yet. (knocking on wood) The head phones aren't the best but they aren't bad either, if you want a nice noise canceling audio experience, invest in a nice set of Sony or Bose head phones and you will be much happier, but for biking, Kayaking, running or hanging around, the head phones that come with the unit are pretty good. I was disappointed that the Zune didn't come with a wall AC unit, you can only charge the ZUNE with your computer and USB cable out of the box, if you want an actual plug and docking station you have to buy it separately. I went with the ZUNE Home AV kit which is very sharp, Microsoft's design team did a great job with the accessories, I think they look great. The AV Kit is really nice, it allows you to hook your ZUNE up to your TV and Stereo, once you do this you can view all your pictures and album art right on your TV, this is a great feature for parties when somebody asks "What band is this?" or "What album is that on?" I just wish that there were a nice inexpensive set of desktop speakers, I can use my old Altec Lansing Speaker Dock for the iPod but it's not powered, so right now I am using a cheap set that I got as a give away at a trade show, I just plug in the USB and I'm all set, I would like something that's better quality and portable like my Bose iPod Sound Doc.. So there you have it, I hope you found this review to be informative and useful, if you are looking for a great really sharp looking device for pictures and music the ZUNE will not disappoint. If you are looking for a device for Movies you might want to try something else or wait for the generation II Zune that packs a little more storage.. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen, flawless interface, album art. 
Cons:. fingerprints. 
Summary:. I've tried Ipod and frankly it doesn't hold a candle to Zune. Zune does all the core tasks that ipod does plus comes with a bigger screen, is lighter, has a radio, has wifi, and has a much better interface.. 

$$;
Pros:. The visual setup, music quality, screen size, video support and wi-fi song sharing.. 
Cons:. Lack of color choices for the players, not an outstanding marketplace yet.. 
Summary:. I think this could still be and Ipod killer, I know its been out for a while and it hasnt risen yet to Ipod status but I believe its getting there. It just doesnt have the years of popularity behind it like the Ipod does.. But as a media player I think its outstanding and it should be the norm for all people with media players. It a great player and thats why im giving it a 10 out of 10..

Cons:. It is withiut cons. 
Summary:. Stop Looking and by the Zune.

Pros:. Size, no Click Wheel, Screen, not an iPod. 
Cons:. Not many people have discovered it or made the switch yet, ZMP could be better. 

$$;
Pros:. $15.00/ Month all you can dowload/ Zune Marketplace is Awesome. 
Cons:. No videos on Zune Marketplace. 
Summary:. I bought a Zune two days ago and it is definitely better than the Ipod. First off you only have to pay $15.00 a month for all you can download. Also if you want the burn rights for a song it's only 79 microsoft points. The library is quite expansive and transferring songs and pictures is fast. You only get to listen to a transfered song for 3 days or 3 times, but you can download the song on the zune marketplace for your Zune. This is really a great player. Oh and the Zune converted all my video files, please don't listen to the idiots who say you have to buy special software.. 

$$;
Pros:. User interface is much better than IPOD. 
Cons:. Little bit larger than IPOD Video. 
Summary:. I got a Zune for Christmas and I love it. I previously had an IPOD. I fine the Zune much more intuitive and I'm glad to stop using ITUNES. The screen size is much better for watching videos and turning them landscape really helps too..

Pros:. GREAT SOUND,EASY SET-UP,GREAT DESIGN. 
Cons:. NONE SO FAR. 
Summary:. I WANT PEOPLE TO READ THIS REVIEW SO THAT THEY DON'T FIND OUT THE HARD WAY LIKE ME HOW TO SET THIS UNIT UP PROPERLY.TO GET THE BEST POSSIBLE SOUND OUT-PUT,BECAUSE SOUND IS EVERYTHING TO ME AND THIS UNIT IS GREAT WITH THE RIGHT SET-UP.SO FIRST IF YOU WANT TO PUT YOUR CD COLLECTION ONTO THIS UNIT.YOU NEED TO GO INTO OPTIONS AND SET IT UP FOR THE BEST POSSIBLE SOUND OUTPUT SEE INSTRUCTIONS ( NOTE # IT WILL HOLD LESS MUSIC-BUT STILL HOLDS A TON ) BUT THE ULTIMATE SOUND IS GREAT AND WELL WORTH IT.NEXT GET YOURSELF AN EXTERNAL HARDDRIVE AT LEAST 30GB BECAUSE IF YOU KEEP ALL THIS MUSIC ON YOUR C DRIVE YOU WILL SLOW YOUR PC WAY DOWN .NEXT BUY GOOD EARBUDS I RECOMMEND ULTIMATE EARS SUPER FI.5 PRO WITH DUAL DRIVERS BUT NOTE THEY WILL COST YOU JUST AS MUCH AS THE ZUNE ITSELF BUT TRUST ME IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFRENCE.IF YOU DO THESE 3 THINGS YOU WILL HAVE A BLAST WITH THIS GREAT UNIT.SO GOOD LUCK AND ROCK OUT!!!.

Pros:. Crazy Video quality, Sound quality. 
Cons:. limited wireless, 3 day limit for transfered songs. 
Summary:. Guys this is one of the best product in MP3?Video devices. If anyone complains about this device only plays .wmv, try the below method and its works for .avi and .mpeg too. Its one of the biggest mistake made by microsoft but its good for us lol (Thanks to Zune Scene). Mayooran. These are the steps:. 1. Rename your avi (or mpg...) file to wmv.. 2. Add it to the Zune library. How? Just put it in a folder that the Zune Software monitors and you should see it in your library soon after that. If you don't see it yet, you can force the Zune Software to refresh the library by clicking F3 and hit OK.. 3. Once your file is in the Video--&gt;library--&gt;Recently added, do not sync! Using windows, rename your file back from wmv to avi.. 4. Now you can sync. Zune software should convert the file from avi to wmv and sync it to your device.. 

$$;
Pros:. This MP3\VIDEO\PHOTO\FM player is the BEST!. 
Cons:. none at all. 
Summary:. All you other people on here rating this below an 8 are just f*cking dumb as hell. This player is the best that is out right now. There are already hundreds of mods for the ZUNE that outright beat the I-Pod and Zen and all the other crap that is called an mp3 player. Microsoft will not let any other company beat out there player not what so ever. Microsoft makes this player basically opensource, all you need is to look around on some blogs and find some software to mod &#38; trick out you ZUNE. I am very very VERY happy with my ZUNE and have already modded the hell out it and it blows away all the other MP3 players out right now. I have had an IPOD and they suck, IPODs have very short battery life, there progs you can mod the IPOD with are very weak and dull. The ZEN have to many blocks and you end up changing the code in the software to do anything. IPOD and ZEN have no match at all up against the ZUNE. So all you MAC f*ckers out there can keep crying when they can't share any music with another IPOD dumbas* and they can really cry when they run out of there battery in 4 hours. OH yeah also MAC will NOT replace your dead battery even with a warrenty. Microsoft WILL reaplace ANYTHING if your ZUNE goes bad, but really the ZUNE will not die out. TRUST me GET A ZUNE, you'll love it!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great smooth sleek durable style. 
Cons:. NOTHING, its just a amazing technology achievement. 
Summary:. Amazing. I have found 0 Faults so far. Its great looking and navigating and great sounding.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easier than iPod, more stylish than iPod, more hand pleasing than iPod. 
Cons:. Screen Resolution is slightly off. Slightly larger than iPod video. iPod die-hard fans giving Zune bad reviews. 
Summary:. I would recommend Zune to those who are always looking for more. Zune is a new kind of technology; not only is it a MP3 player, it has a very modern, artistic feel. The customizable options in Zune allow you to adapt your unit to you. With iPod, you get the same white unit, the same blue interface, and the same thing as everybody else has. The translucent plastic shell of the Zune is very eye-appealing, and the plastic has a very, very soft feel to it and is very comfortable to hold. Everything about the Zune is favorable. The metallic trim along the screen and scroll button seems to perfectly go in sync with the rest of the scheme, and the scroll button feels much more accurate than iPods- if you're new to the machines, you won't be pressing all around the wheel to get to your favorite song. What is arguably the best feature of Zune is the wi-fi. This is mainly the focus of Microsoft's "Welcome to the Social" slogan. It's very entertaining to be in the same room with someone and not know they have a Zune, but both Zunes will let the Users know that they detect each other, and the users can swap and share content as they wish- definitely an innovation in Personal Media Players. The screen resolution is the only concern, as it has a larger screen than the iPod video, it has the same number of pixels. This is practically unnoticeable to the average eye, and the Zune has so many great features that make up for this tiny flaw.. I am completely satisfied with my Zune and what it lets me do, and I honestly do believe that Zune patches up all the flaws that iPod has, and that Zune is much more personal than an iPod on so many different levels, and because of it's well-known competition with iPod, I believe Zune can only get better and better..

Pros:. the picture songs everything. 
Cons:. the structure.

Pros:. Wifi, Radio, screen, and style. 
Cons:. Lack of colors. 
Summary:. I am fed up with the terrible press and bad reviews of this product by Ipod fans, which is making me sick because this MP3 player rocks, but everybody is so obsessed and in love with their Ipods that they do not want to try something new. I think it is because Ipod fans are afraid that they are actually gonna like it more. I do not understand why people are bashing the Zune because competition is good and we consumers win with better features from our MP3 players not the same old features Apple offers for high prices, but better smaller, thinner, cooler, and more stylish designs that just make us want to buy and not care about whether they have the same old features or not.. The Zune has more features than the Ipod and is better built and seems like it would last longer too. You do not have to buy unnecessary accessories to protect the Zune or feel like your gonna break it in your hands. People complain the most about the size, screen, and the Zune music store. The fact is people are not giving this MP3 player a chance. The first Zune is just as big as the first generation Ipod, but looks much more stylish and has a big screen, which is a good thing because it is easier on your eyes watching movies, videos, scroll through the menu, etc.. The music store is unbelievable because it has a subscription which means you do not not have to burn 99 cents on multiple songs and each song is cheaper. In fact it is about 79 cents a song.. The bottom line is that this MP3 player has a huge potential in my opinion to be an Ipod killer and your getting more features for your money. Also this MP3 player is finger looking good especially from a top view which gives you an idea of what it would look like if it was actually thinner like the Ipod video. This MP3 is so sexy and looks like a must have gadget, but people are afraid of change because the Ipod was the first MP3 player and really had no competition until now. The Ipod completely revolutionized pop culture and music in general, but the Zune is taking the MP3 music revolution to another level. This is the Zunes first year and it is not disappointing with the features unlike the Ipod. Anyway the Apple Ipod was not that great and it was all about the marketing. Everybody had one and there was really no competition so nobody could resist it. The Apple Ipods counterattack to the Zune is the touch screen Ipod, which I believe they are trying to bring out before Christmas, but it probably won't come out until sometime next year.. 

$$;
Pros:. Design and a big screen a plus, ease of navigation equal greatness. 
Cons:. Good start for Microsft for now.. 
Summary:. Zune ease to navigate and wide viewing screen adds to the comfort of enjoying more than music on this device. Opinions vary as to how one might view the Zune but for me, I see beyond the current device. I look toward the future of Zune with all smiles just like the XBOX first hit stores with mix feelings. Zune's release is another big step for the MP3 community. Zune = Raising the Bars.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extremely simple to setup, great interface, great screen. 
Cons:. Video not yet support in online market place. 
Summary:. I purchased this unit a couple days ago and I'm very happy with it. I've been very impressed with the whole experience (packaging, installation, etc.). The user interface is very inuitive. I love watching video and perusing photos of my son on the large screen. I choose this unit becuase I'm PC based and have an XBOX 360. I understood the integration to be very strong. After the installation, I discovered it was everything I had heard. The Zune software is actually my streaming media connection with the 360.. I look forward to the addition of online video fromt the Zune Market place.. I highly recommend this unit!. Note to all of those people who don't own one of these units but continue to write online reviews with low scores. Stop! Just because you have a problem with Microsoft doesn't mean that everyone does.. 

$$;
Pros:. Made by Microsoft. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. Hopefully it finally wipes the crappy low quality MP3 / AAC music from iPods off the map.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design, convenient interface. 
Cons:. Wish it was touchscreen. 
Summary:. Excellent MP3 player, definitely gonna put this on my Christmas list. This is iPod's ultimate rival and will put Apple to shame. I prefer this over the iPod because iPod is the only MP3 player that needs something like iTunes for it to function. For the Zune, plug, goto WMP, Sync, its done.. 

$$;
Pros:. iPod will finally get fair competition, making both devices better.. 
Cons:. Might be a flawed player, and will require an updated player.. 
Summary:. Well, even if the Zune isn't as good as the hype says (probrably not) iPod will finally get good competition and both powerhouses will compete and we will win either way. I for one don't like the iPod, and ill be buying the Zune. Of course, if the iPod is better, then I'll wait a while and see if the Zune gets better. Again, either way, we, the consumer, win.. PCMag's review:. The Microsoft Zune ($249.99 list) is a shot across iPod's bow. I got a first-hand look at the Toshiba-built, Microsoft-designed digital music player and the associated software and supporting Web site and all I can say is "Wow.". SLIDESHOW (11). Slideshow | All Shots. For years, the Apple iPod has taken Microsoft to school. Microsoft's responses, up until now, have been tepid, at best. Remember the first portable media players and that gosh-awful feeling that way too much had been crammed into the devices (the first Creative Zen being a prime example)? Forget that. In fact, forget everything you know about how Microsoft builds consumer electronics productsthe Xbox notwithstanding.. * Product Guide: MP3 Players. * A New Front in the Apple/Microsoft War. * Apple iPod (80GB). The Zune is clear proof that Microsoft has learned something from Apple and virtually every other music player manufacturer that's come before it. The 5.6-ounce device feels good in your hand. At first, Microsoft will just offer a 30GB model. Nonetheless, it's a bit heavier than the 80GB iPod with video. At 0.6 inches, it's also thickerthe remaining dimensions are 2.4 inches wide by 4.4 inches long.. Offered in three colorswhite, black, and brownthe Zune is not nearly as shiny as an iPod. In fact, the plastic casing has a subtle texture. My unit initially looked all brown, but then I noticed green piping along the edges. Oddly, it seemed to disappear when I turned the player this way and that. Microsoft execs explained that I was seeing the real color of the outer plastic coveringit's green. The translucent plastic covers the device, which is painted brown. This is a nice feature and means you cannot scratch the paintthough you could conceivably scratch the plastic. Microsoft told me they expect the fine texture to get sort of burnished from people holding the Zune, which could personalize these players. We'll see.. When you first look at the Zune, you think it might be missing a few buttons. The screen fills most of the face and delivers 320-by-240 images in portrait and landscape mode. Below is a navigation wheel that, unlike iPod's scroll wheel, is not touch sensitive but responds nicely to pushes. To the left is the back button and, on the right-hand side of the wheel, a play/pause button. That's it. The nav wheel is the focal point (aside from the screen) and is easily five times the size of the smaller buttons beside it. All three of them sit about a quarter-inch from the base. As soon as I held the Zune, my thumb instinctively reached for the center one. I found I could effortlessly touch and use even the small buttons. Within 30 seconds I was using the Zune to play music and watch the accompanying music video.. The interface has folders and levels, as you would expect. The main screen's options are Music, Video, Pictures, Community, and Settings. I instinctively used the top of the nav wheel to move up and down the menu and the center of the wheel to select. I was able to drill down to an album and find a song. When I selected a track and hit the play button (the center button can play, too), the screen shifted to widescreen automatically, so I turned the player sideways in my hand. This didn't confuse me, perhaps because the nav-wheel controls rotate 90 degrees as well. So the volume-increase button, on the right-hand side of the wheel, is still in the same spot.. Audio sounded excellent, and the video looked sharp and bright. I didn't notice any issues with reflection on the shiny screen indoors. We'll have to wait for outdoor tests to see how well it holds up in sunlight. The player also has a built-in FM radio that picked up dozens of stations with almost startling clarity. And the device supports RDS data service, which some radio stations use to send station identification and track info along with the audio broadcast.. Microsoft spent a lot of time telling us about the "Zune Experience." A big part of that is the "social" or community aspect of the device. This isn't lip service. Zune has 802.11g/b ad hoc networking built in. I used this feature to exchange music and photos with other Zune users. To send, I simply navigated to any piece of content and used the "send" option. Doing so took me to a menu that showed all available Zune devices. Anyone within a 30-foot range who has wireless turned on in their Zune (you can choose to have it off) showed up on the list, and it even told me what they were doing"watching video," "viewing photos," or "playing music." (I'll admit that's a little creepy, but it too can be turned off.) I selected one and then waited for that party to accept my file. You can choose to accept or reject it. Anything you accept goes into your inbox.. Shared photos can live indefinitely on another Zune user's player. Music is another story. Any music you share will live for three days or three plays; then it goes gray and unplayable. The good news is that you can flag it so it's easy to find if you want to buy your own copy. Which leads us to the software.. I could not personally test the Zune desktop software or marketplace store, but what I saw and heard was encouraging. The Zune app looks dead simpleits controls are obviously modeled on the physical Zune. Of course, it and the Zune are not PlaysForSure compliant, so music from other compliant services (including MSN music) cannot be pulled in there. There is good news, though. The marketplace will launch with two million songs andthis is the really good parta subscription service. You get all the songs you can digest for $14.99 a month. That's smart and something we've been begging Apple to do with iTunes. You can also purchase tracks individually for 79 "Microsoft points" per track. Microsoft points are credits that are currently used by Xbox Live subscribers to purchase content.. The marketplace will not initially offer videoso the only video you'll play will be what you download elsewhere.. Not everything that Microsoft is doing is different. The battery is rated for 14 hours (with wireless off) and 13 hours (wireless on). The Zune plays 4 hours of videobut without movies or TV shows, I'm not sure who would care. What you can't do, however, is replace the battery. I'm not sure why Microsoft made this choice, aside from that it could have helped createas far as I can tella near-seamless fit and finish.. From a purely subjective perspective, the Microsoft Zune achieved something that precious few portable music players have done before: It made me want it. I really wanted to take one home and play with it for hours. The Zune's release is not only Microsoft's best shot at the iPod, it could be the best one, period.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has taste, simplicity, and a good name behind it. 
Cons:. Not exactly out yet, no real data. 
Summary:. Microsoft is one to look at, but let others try first. If given the choice of a free ipod or free zune, i would go with the zune. I own a 30 gig ipod video and cannot say that I am the most pleased with it. at $.99 a song, and haveing to buy a case to protect it from anything, the only good thing about it is that it actually plays music and videos quite well.. The zune however appears to already have some level of protection, not likely to scratch or ding like the ipod, and at $14.99 a month, I can get all the music etc... I want.. Above all the WiFi and landscape talk, I think that the fact that microsoft is takeing responsability for pirated music and compensating record companys impresses me the most. They mean buisness. Don't whine if a song is encoded and can only be played 3 times, if you subscribe to the zune marketplace, I believe you can tag songs you like and when you connect your player to the computer, it will download it automatically. Trying to protect music rights and encoding songs should not be a drawback to those with a soul. I know that music I hear that is pirated really makes me feel slightly guilty. Knowing that all my music will be protected and is bought legaly will help me to enjoy the zune more. that is, as soon as I get one. I will have to wait for my ipod to break (which it has once already) to get a refund and buy a zune if it is as good as the producers say.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wireless, screen size. 
Cons:. Music format compatibility, controls, looks. 
Summary:. I give it a 10 to even out with the usual childish 1's of ignorant Apple fanboys.. I do think it won't be better than the iPod Video, though, IMHO.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's not an iPod. 
Cons:. I don't have it in my paws yet!. 
Summary:. OK, I'm tired of people writing "Reviews" that say nothing but "It Sucks", although this is a very intelligent and insightful review, a review consists of facts or personal expierence. NONE of the opinions, except for the FEW that have actually used one are just the moronic ramblings of, well I guess, militant Mac/Linux users. I sold my 60gig iPod so I could get a Zune based on my less than stellar experience with the iPod and with Apple products overall. Yeah Microsoft is a behemoth corporation, BUT my guess is that they wont release a MINIMAL upgrade to their device and call it a completely revised and improved product like Apple is famous for. Unless you have had on IN YOUR HANDS and can give REAL reasons why it sucks or it rules, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!!!! I am so tired of the "My operating system is better than yours" argument!!! It all boils down to personal preference. I have been in the graphic design/marketing business for 14 years now and have worked with Macs for a lot of that time, and I HATE THEM!!!! So I'm not just a Microsoft stoolie, I've worked with both and I PREFER Windows, don't think it's any better or worse than Macs, I have just had a better experience with Microsoft. ANYHOO, I'll stop rambling and just wait for the flames. :0). 

$$;
Pros:. Not one of 75% of the mp3 players sold in the world. 
Cons:. Unproven and untested. 
Summary:. Lets face who and his dog doesn't have an iPod? That is why the Zune will succeed. What made the Mac succeed? Yeah that's right the samething that will make the zune succeed. Ipods are good but boring and resting on their laurels. Should've released wi-fi along time ago...no radio..etc. So, they're going to follow zune in a few months? Is this what expect from a leader in this field? The zune is a breath of fresh air in a market dominated by iPod. Also try rating the player when actually have it. Rating it as 1 and 10 is the same when you don't have it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Why not come out with one?. 
Cons:. There are no cons to competition. 
Summary:. The dumbest statement I have seen today was:. "Why bother to come out with this?". Couldn't the same be said to apple and their ipod? WHy did they bother?. Competition is healthy and only helps consumers by driving down prices and adding features.. I guess if a penguin was drawn on the side it'd be just peachy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Design, Great Player. 
Cons:. No WiFi Music Store Support. 
Summary:. I just want to know... Will the ZUNE play Windows Media Center Recorded TV shows?. 

$$;
Pros:. It's not out yet. 
Cons:. It's not out yet. 
Summary:. SO MANY PEOPLE have LOGGED REVIEWS on this thing.. IT HASN'T BEEN RELEASED. Give me a break.. Do me a favor - use your head and review something that you actually have experience with.. 

$$;
Pros:. Call me on November 15th. 
Cons:. Call me on November 15th!. 
Summary:. I am LOVING all these reviews and feedback systems, based on a jpg file a three month old spec sheet and hearsay! I may be the only one around here who thinks that people who review products based on hearsay and spec sheets are a few breasts short of a bucket, but at least it's entertaining. Take a look at CNET's review pages...there are about three other products reviewed here that have as many or more user reviews and this is for a product that is two weeks from hitting the street. If there is one person around to write a credible review based on having touched and used the product I'd love to hear from you, but hearing for a Mac-Happy dIckPod user is not something I would consider constructive to the readers.. Why is that Ipodders are so defensice and protective about their property anyway? Protection is generally based on an overabundence of fear....you're not afraid that Microsoft has made a better product are you? No....oh well I didn't think you would think that anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. None, why because its not out yet. 
Cons:. None, why because its not out yet. 
Summary:. now here is a question to all of you people who gave -ve feedback to this mp3 player, do you own this player? did you use it yet? did you even see it on a display anywhere?? i am not a fan of MS, i think most of there devices have issues, look at windows for software and xbox for hardware, but i am not a fan of apple either. i bought ipod color and within 2 weeks the darn thing gave up on me. but the thing is i used it and saw its flaw first handed. so if come here and leave a -ve feedback, it will be from what i experianced, not from what i think or what i heard.. some people here say that MS copied ipod, my question to them, who is not? creative did, toshiba did, sony did. but along with that what they are also doing is making it better. so until zune is out in the market i think its unfair to rate it. think about this, zune is designed my MS but manufactured by toshiba, and last time i checked on cnet, toshiba kicked @$$ of ipod!!. 

$$;
Pros:. The WiFi capability sold me on this product, there is alot of other room for expansion on this product. 
Cons:. None that I have found.. 
Summary:. What a great product, as the old saying goes don't knock it till you try it. Then again there are people who are just ignorant and just rant because it is Microsoft.. 

$$;
Pros:. pretty much everything. 
Cons:. no camera or phone. 
Summary:. this could be the device that breaks the ipod, its well thought out with a big screen, has wifi capabilities, and a nice size hard drive, the only drawbacks i see is that it isnt a phone and it doesnt support a camera, but neither does the ipod. 

$$;
Pros:. Wifi, brown, 3in screen. 
Cons:. nothing, except battery life. 
Summary:. WOW i cant wait for this, sharing music, i love the brown (more professional) well i just love the device. zunelicious.blogspot.com. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen - mce pc connectivity - fm tuner. 
Cons:. wifi is limited. 
Summary:. I love all the features on this player. i do have an I pod and I believe Zune is a superior player for now.. There are too many MS haters rating this player low just becouse is a MS Brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. It all looks good to me. 
Cons:. Its up against big competitors. 
Summary:. I think this looks great and i hope it leads to a portable xbox. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks promising. 
Cons:. none to my knowlegde. 
Summary:. I've been reading the bad reviews and they are unfounded and unfair. People are giving this player a poor score with no details as to why; other than they looovvve their ipod and they think Microsoft sucks. If you love your ipod, go and give it a "10", but don't give its competitors a bad review.. 

$$;
Pros:. everything is perfect. 
Cons:. why still ipod on market. 
Summary:. just perfect, can't compare to ipod. 

$$;
Pros:. online rental service, higher WMA 192kbps bitrate encoding, WIFI, FM radio, wallpappers,. 
Cons:. limited battery life, thick, no playforshure support,. 
Summary:. I beleive Ipod and Zune both are good. But Zune offer some extra features which ipod don't offer like FM radio, WIFI, wallpappers,bigger screen, media center sync. Ipod got some adv too like online movies and music videos downloads, audio books. Apple, Microsoft and Sony will be biggest compt in future( that,s what i beleive)for each others. As i know Apple building online rental store software for sony and also sony have adv of PSP and some great battery life mp3 players(great sound quality also). Microsoft will grab 25% to 30% market share from Apple until end of 2007(for sure) and about Apple we all know. So 2007 will be huge for these three comp.. 

$$;
Pros:. 3 inch screen and sexy look. 
Cons:. kind of large and thick. 
Summary:. I like the Zune. It looks great to me it could be a little thinner. It has great features and could be a great alternative to the ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. The connected experience!. 
Cons:. Its late on the game :-(. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent design with wi fi and a huge screen. 
Cons:. better than a regular mp3 player and not and ipod.

$$;
Pros:. beautiful design, and wi-fi AND FM radio. 
Cons:. NOT an ipod. 
Summary:. this is THE player to have. it has everything that the ipod doesnt have, and wat is the same is made better. stop bashing this its not even out yet. and stop saying the ipod is so great. its all in the marketing. its really not that great.. 

$$;
Pros:. The big screen is perfect. excellent durability. this thing is impossible to destroy. i have had it for 3 years and it stopped working once.. 
Cons:. the zune software sucks.. 
Summary:. if you want a durable mp3 player this is it.i love this thing. 

$$;
Pros:. ive had my zune for a couple of years now and it still works well it has easy to use software and is rather durable. works good with pc sftware. 
Cons:. its big and Bulky. not compatible with mac. 

$$;
Pros:. Radio, wifi, big screen, games. 
Cons:. The only bad thing about it in my opinion, is that all the Zune 30GB froze today.. 
Summary:. A very good mp3 player, but tons are freezing today.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen size, pic/vid quality, sound, storage, design!. 
Cons:. size, and responsiveness. 
Summary:. this is an excellent device!! walks all over i pod!. i love it! it's sound quality, its awesome design, everything about it is defiantly worth buying! the only real complaint that i have is how big it is, if it was just a tad-bit slimmer it would be a perfect 5-stars!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. very nice and easy to0 manipulate it. 
Cons:. the songs has expired thats why hard for me to sync my pc coz ive lost my zune microsoft...... 
Summary:. i like this product but theres a certain problem the songs has expired can u help me to sync to my pc thanks a lot. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics, user interface, audio quality, video quality, wi-fi, battery life, and very nice ear buds.. 
Cons:. Lacks updates, takes too long to convert mp4 files, not a lot of accessories and I don't really like the software.. 
Summary:. I got the Zune for Christmas of '07 because I wasn't really into the whole iPod thing.The graphics, user interface, and sound really made it than the previous media player I had , Creative Zen. The player was great but their were a few lacks, like the updates for example. Overall, I think this can be a true iPod killer with a few updates.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice looking, good battery life, easy to use. 
Cons:. cant delete songs from player unless connected to computer. 
Summary:. best gift ever. 

$$;
Pros:. Tough, has video, and pictures as well.. 
Cons:. Battery Life. 
Summary:. If your in the military these days, you i know that having an MP3 player is almost a must to combat boredom. Its pretty tough, and plays pretty loud. The battery life sucks, but most mp3 players don't last long. Plus it has video and picure capability.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and navigate. Reliable. Has Radio, wireless sync, wireless swapping, podcast section, great all around product, customizeable background, big screen, beatiful videos.. 
Cons:. No time, games, no contacts. 
Summary:. I think this is better than an ipod and will eventually destroy the ipod in all aspects once microsoft really learns the mp3 business. They are on their second gen and are keeping up with apple who is on their 6th generation.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great product, sleek design, lots of great features!. 
Cons:. There could be more varietys as far as colors go.. 
Summary:. I think the zune is awesome it is by far better than the ipod for multiple reasons. And the cost compared to an ipod is better as well. I found a great site that has these in many different styles and I would recommend a zune to anyone. Go to www.theshoppingnation.com and check them out. I know you will love the zune so much more than any ipod you've ever owned!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Screen buttons are up, down Left, right, back , Play/pause. 
Cons:. No Search function. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Sound and Video Quality. 
Cons:. Slightly larger then the video Ipod.. 
Summary:. I have no complaints about the Microsoft Zune.. I Have the 30gb.(black) version, and everything about it is perfect. The sound and video quality is better then any Ipod I Have ever owned. The Zune software is really simple to use, and very effective. The Zune is slightly larger in size then my video Ipod, but it has a great feel to it. There are many Zune brand, and after market accessories available. I highly recommend the Zune to anyone. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use. Lots of features; Looks better than I thought.. 
Cons:. Not quite as snappy when running through files as I'd like.. 
Summary:. This media player does it all. I now have all the pictures of my son at my fingertips, and it acts as a backup should anything happen to the hard drive on my CPU. I have had no trouble loading Youtube videos, DVD movies and other free content found online, including podcasts. But of course it really excels at music. Easy to find what you are looking for, and album art comes through automatically. The sound quality is as good as any portable device I've heard including Walkman CD players. My one and only complaint is that there is a little lag when flipping through the 700+ pictures I have on the device.. One thing I didn't realize is how good this player looks with the "double-shot" paint job.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wi-Fi is great once you crack it; Zune software very efficient and large database of songs; great feel. 
Cons:. Vanilla Wi-Fi not so great; weird resolution issues; lack of supported formats. 
Summary:. I wasn't expecting much out of this product, but I have an aversion to iPods, and I also don't write off every MS product before it's released (see my 360 review).. I am very pleased with it, particularly with interface. It's simple and effective. The case is completely scratch and fingerprint-proof, and I haven't had any problems with the screen...yet.. On the screen, though, it's got a funky resolution. It's the same as the iPod's, which is incongruous with Zune's larger screen. Don't be deceived, though; Zune's screen is only a little bigger than iPod's, but it makes a big difference.. Watch out with song formats, however. If you use iTunes extensively (which is your own fault), DO NOT buy a Zune; stick with your iPod (not anything else you can do with iTunes, though, right Apple fanboys?. If your songs are in mp3 or wma 10, you're good to go. For some reason, Zune doesn't support wma 9. Microsoft goof or not, it doesn't support many formats, but what it does support it does brilliantly.. As for Wi-Fi, it's great if you crack it. Google "Zune Wi-Fi crack" to figure it out. It's straightforward and makes this portable a must-have.. 

$$;
Pros:. beautiful screen, more features than ipods, great battery life, extremely scratch resistant caseing, excelent sound quality, the ability to use subscription based music. 
Cons:. no voice recorder or fm fario recording, no clock, no alarm capabilities,. 
Summary:. one of the best mp3 players i have ever owned, and i have owned many from almost every manufacturer out there. seamless integration with software and subscription music services, beautiful screen although the resolution i believe could be a little better, good battery life and i must note that the batteries are user replaceable with a little know how.... wireless capabilities are a nice feature although it would be nice if it wasn't so restricted. i own both a zune and 2 ipods and i have to say that my ipods can not compare to the feature set and usability of my zune and the zune well surpasses the ipods audio quality which is a big thing to me. great product and i think in a few years its going to be even better with more features and a more refined design. the new zunes are scheduled to come out on the 16th of October 2007. cant wait to get my hands on a new one. great product. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, simple, changeable backgrounds, etc..... 
Cons:. fat, can't use other OS's on the Zune. 
Summary:. I LUV IT!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. SPECTACULAR SOUND QUALITY excellent screen size durable great interface. 
Cons:. no video/ tv offers from zune marketplace. 
Summary:. first off (i will adress complaints) you'll notice almost all bad reviews for this product were written by ipod owners who do not own the zune and simply hate it because it is made by microsoft. Second,people say its too big, well the zune body is actually the smallest of the ipod and zen vision m (not including the screen). the zune also has spectacular sound quality compared to ipod. this came as a shock to me as i owned an ipod nano before i bought the zune. the difference is amazing. Next, ipods "classics" break very easily, simply by sitting on them can break the screen. and my brothers zen vision m broke when it fell 12 in.on to tiled floor (since then the screen on his vision M has broken 2 other times each replacemnt costing over 50$) when he was sitting on the john. i was shoked to find that my zune wasnt scratched wen it fell about 7 feet from a loft bed before bauncing off a wooden table and hitting the floor. the zune is very hard to accidentially break. Lastly, i love the interface wich is a lost easier and faster to use then the ipod. you can also personalize the interface with your photos.. And who do you think apple got thaeir "widescreen idea from"? yeah they simply copied toshiba (the company thatmakes the zunes) oh yeah i did say that there were not any video offers from zune marketplace wich kinda sucks but i expect that to chage within the next year.. overall spectacular player and you cant beat the ability to wirelessly send music and photos to another zune anywhere no hot spots needed.( 100 dollars less then ipod touch which has half of the memory of the zune). 

$$;
Pros:. Sound Quality, Interface, ease of use. 
Cons:. Not as "sexy" as the Ipod or as fun as the Creative Vision M.. 
Summary:. I have read many of the reviews for the IPod, Creative Vision M, and the Zune, and of course everyone has their favorite, but I have to say that the Zune beats the others hands down in sound quality. I have compared the three using quality headphones, Grado SR60's and Shure E2c's, and have come to the following conclusions: The Zune has a much more open and full sound while the Ipod and Vision M sound one-dimensional in comparison. The highs are also cleaner and smoother on the Zune, the highs on the Ipod and The Vision M sounding strident and distorted next to the Zune. Listen to the background singers on Mariah Carey's "Any Time You Need a Friend" and you will see what I mean. On the Zune the definition in the highs is definitely superior.. I am not a Microsoft fan by any means, and there were many reasons I wanted to like the Vision M and Ipod more such as the size, the fun factor, and the overall design of each player, but sound quality is a priority for me and no matter how I tried to convince myself to go with the other two I kept coming back to the more musical and satisfying sound of the Zune. If you are contemplating purchasing one of these players I would recommend you compare them side by side. If sound quality is not a priority then you may very well opt for an Ipod or Vision M, but if you want the music to move you then get a Zune. One more note...if you use average sounding headphones or earphones you may not be able to hear the difference. Invest in a pair of quality phones and you will hear the difference and enjoy your music like you never have. I did not give the Zune a rating of ten because there are reasons to prefer the other mentioned players, but, again, sound quality is the best available.. 

$$;
Pros:. WiFi, File sharing, Community, Videos are clear and on a bigger screen than the iPod. UNLIMITED DOWNLOADS for a small monthly fee, as oppose to iTunes .99 a song! Plays DivX files.. 
Cons:. A little on the heavy side, Besides that I cant think of any CONS.. 
Summary:. Zune is here and it is gonna crush the MAC world. Microsoft answers MAC with a bang. The Zune is the best player by far that I have owned. I have a couple iPod's but I said the heck with buying a new iPod every year because MAC decides to upgrade a lil feature within its toy. Zune does automatic updates (THANKS TO OUR FRIENDS AT MICROSOFT). The sound quality is amazing. The screen is awesome and vivid. Really cool features such as WiFi allowing you to share your media wirelessly to anyone else who has a Zune. HOW COOL IS THAT? Zune = THE NEXT BEST THING! iPod gen 100000 = OLD NEWS!. 

$$;
Pros:. battery life, changable background, fm radio, share music.. 
Cons:. Software interface.. 
Summary:. Ive had this zune since December and it hasnt given me a problem. The updates are simple and few. The music runs great the videos are excellent. It is well worth the money and its very sleek in my opinion. The software interface is a little confusing though, I am still learning how to use it after 6 months and there is no manual on how to use it either. Still its a great player and I wouldnt trade it for that one con. Oh and battery life is great. Recently tested it out flying back home. Cincinnati to Los Angeles then on from Los Angeles to Honolulu with no recharge anywhere between there. The display setting were set on low but I still had battery life even when i landed in Hawaii. I was very surprised by that and its another reason to keep it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, fluent video, sounds great, solid design. 
Cons:. bundled earphones. 
Summary:. Replace the bundled earphones with some Sennheiser PX-100 and you'll have a fantastic sound.. 

$$;
Pros:. great video, responsive, excellent sound quality. 
Cons:. very limited wifi. 
Summary:. I have been looking forward to get this for a long time now. I love absolutely everything about this except the wifi. I recommend this over the Ipod, having more features.. 

$$;
Pros:. I trust Microsoft.. 
Cons:. Wish battery life was longer.. 
Summary:. I liked it. I was a little disapointed with battery life, but other than that this thing is HOT!!!. I also liked the big screen that it had. Vertical display works great for me, when I wanted to watch a video on it this thing it automaticly switched from vertical to horizontal display, it also switched the controls were you can control it horizontally. To me it was well worth the $250.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing Sound Quality, Marketplace Subscription, Large Screen.. 
Cons:. Limited WiFi Usage, Buggy Software.. 
Summary:. I did a lot of research between this and the iPod. The iPod is cool and all but I would be buying it just to look "Cool". The Zune however has been worth the money. Even with it's included ear buds the sound quality is still great.I LOVE the large screen and the customizable wallpaper option. Video playback is crisp. I've only shared songs once and that's it. The rule is 3days or 3plays which sucks, but oh well don't use the WIFI anyway.. I like the ease of use of the software except it freezes at least 3 times per session. Overall this is a good player. Give it a chance and see how much you will love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. awsome screen res, easy to use, durable as a brick. 
Cons:. file sharing limited, accessories too expensive, alittle thick, doesn't play alot of formats. 
Summary:. I asked for a zune to because I like microsoft products and I heard bad things about ipods. The file sharing was limited but it wasn't the point of the device. Its thicker than the ipod so alittle uncomfortable in you pocket. The screen quality is excellent. not too glitches.. 

$$;
Pros:. The resolution of the screen and overall music player experience. 
Cons:. Wish I could do more with the wifi and theer were videos for sale on the market place as well. 
Summary:. I will make this relatively short. I had an Ipod. Was fed up with many restrictions. Had it delete all of the songs on it a few times. I purchased a Zune and was so delighted with it that I sold my Ipod! It works amazingly well with the Zune market place interface and I will never go back to the Ipod. I was so pleased I even bought one for the girlfriend. I pay 14.99 a month and I have an all you can eat pass of LEGAL music. Love this device!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger Screen, Longer Life, More Support, not iFaggy product. 
Cons:. Wifi limited, no xvid/divx support directly. 
Summary:. Really great entry in the Mp3 market. Try to filter out all the apple fanboys, as they're usually scared, pissy and iFaggy.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen, plays movies&#38;pics clearly. 
Cons:. Battery drains quickly when wi-fi is on, no custom equalizer. 
Summary:. I had a white one for about 2 weeks and I love it, it was better than the black 30gb ipod i had with a smaller screen and i can save pics i have on the zune as backgrounds, whats the point of having a picture ipod if u can't use them. Sure as with anything, there are kinks here and there but i haven't had any major problems, the wrost problem i've had is the marketplace, i have xbox live and theres something about having live that messes with the regristration in the marketplace, i recommend the zune not only for it's potential, but its function and looks, i still have not met someone with a zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. Play-back is very good and videos look great on screen. 
Cons:. Battery Life and format compatabitity.. 
Summary:. The Zune is a great Mp3 player.It's design is easy to use and stylish and it's user interface is very easy to use.I bought it last week and have had no trouble so far.I did have to call customer support but the problem was my fault but they were very helpful &#38; didn't have a strong forgin accent. The Zune program is easy to use and I recommend getting the Zune Pass if you download songs allot.15 bucks a month for a the songs you can download is a great deal.There are some things Microsoft could improve but I highly suggest the Zune if your looking for a Mp3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. E-Z sync from computer. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. Just purchased today. Already had Zune on my laptop to stream to my x-box 360. When I hooked up the Zune to my computer all my songs and pictures downloaded immediately...no hitches. Purchased Zune pass and downloaded a lot of albums so far-nice bright screen, no regrets with purchase-wife and son want one now. 

$$;
Pros:. big screen,(again great picture quality), artfully made, works well.. 
Cons:. Bulky and strange programing is a bit vexing.. 
Summary:. I love this system! ipods cost alot of a 5GB ($200) so I like it. It is bit big to lug around and Microsofts programing downloads sample songs that are really sucky, but it is a great system for music and movie alike.. 

$$;
Pros:. i will give a full review of this great player later. 
Cons:. so far none. 
Summary:. can anybody tell me the proper way to shut this player off.i heard if you use the same button to turn it on..that only puts the player in sleep mode.the way i turn it off is.hold the down the back button and push the control pad down.let me know how you turn this baby off.thanks. 

$$;
Pros:. capacity, sound quality,. 
Cons:. software, zune software. 
Summary:. I had an iriver mp3 player before this. it was a 1 gb player and that figures out to roughly 225 songs. i was happy with that until my friend bought her husband a zune and asked me to preload some music on it for him.. oh my god, to say i fell in love with it would be the biggest understatement ever. it was all i ever wanted, huge screen, sound quality, video, pictures and radio (for me to listen to my favorite morning show on the bus in the mornings on the way to work).. the sound quality on the zune is better than on any stereo in my house or in any car and the volume is great. pictures are crystal clear and your video will play as good as you convert them. the radio also picks artist and song info and special announcements. I LOVE THAT! how often do you hear a song on the radio and don't know who the artist is?. now, i will be fair, there are a couple of downsides. first off, the stock headphones are awful, they are tinny and those earbud things and i just went with a pair with bass boost i bought seperately. the one other thing that sucks a little bit is that sometimes the software on the actual zune will freeze for a second (traits of windows xp??). the one other thing that is so-so is the computer software. i wish that since it's a microsoft product it just worked with widnows media but it does not. i don't care for the ripping in the zune software either but that might just be my computer.. at any rate, i love my zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome sceen, love the big album art. Great interface. 
Cons:. Zune Marketplace could be better, pissed off the WiFi doesn't work better,. 
Summary:. Bought the Zune (in black) from BH Photo Video a week ago. Very happy with my purchase, I have owned iPods all my life and this is so much better. Aditmitadly Zune Player/Marketplace could be better though, still not much worse than iTunes. Also the WiFi could have better features but hopefully they will be coming soon!. 

$$;
Pros:. simple elegant interface, big screen, good sound quality. 
Cons:. limited video codec support,. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen and good resolution; good sound. 
Cons:. Battery life. 
Summary:. I've had my zune for about a month and really like it. It's easy to use and easy to sync. The screen is great -- good size and good resolution -- great for slideshows. Battery life isn't great, but it's easy and quick to charge and optional AC and car chargers are available. My only real complaint is the way MS is packaging and marketing their own accessories. Bottom line, though, I'm glad I got it..

Pros:. Screen, Zune to Zune Sharing, Integrated Software, Customization, Durable, Easy Navigation. 
Cons:. Limited WiFi, No CLOCK, No Calendar, No Games, Limited Setting Options. 
Summary:. Ok I just went to Best Buy with 250 bucks in my pocket. I was ready to grab that shiny iPod when I noticed the price of the Zune. It was $229. No there was not too much of a price difference but I wanted to check it out with the product in my hand. I have read about the Zune and about 85% of all coverage is negative. You even have tv shows smashing one! People need to see that the Zune is Microsofts first attempt to enter this field. Apple has had 5gens to get it right. Ok Ok lets get down to the nitty gritty. When you hold the Zune it has a very nice feel to it. I think its I a little to thick (especialy when compared to the iPod) but overall the plastic coating really keeps fingerprints off the device, unlike my friends iPod. I bought the black version and it has a cool little strip of blue plastic around the border that seems to glow in the light. I love the color. White also is good. The screen is beutiful. Video playback was amazing and beats the iPod! I did notice that with some video that I converted (I converted my .avi and other formats using a hack...Google it) that it showed black bars on the top and bottom even though the shows were in widescreen. Now onto music. Music sounded just as good as the iPod. The headphones are good quality and even are magnetic on the back so they stick together. Album art was beutiful and but the iPod to shame. Navigation is smooth but I really wish there was a scroll wheel. The click wheel works well but can get a little tiring. To my amazement quite a few people in my school have Zunes and I use the wifi often. I dont like the limitations but it helps me find new music to download on my own later. The battery life of this player is a little bit less than the iPod but with a large display, its to be expected. You dont really have to turn the wifi off either. The wifi is not a battery drainer. I charge mine each night (not that it always needs it) One thing I did notice is that when you turn your Zune off it actualy just goes to sleep. Sleep mode doesnt drain power very much but if you plan on not using your Zune for more than 3-4 days press the back and down key for several seconds to fully power it off. Whew this is a long review... Ok lets see what next. Oh yes settings! You can set the screen brightness but I was not impressed. Its High, Medium, Low. Each setting is not a drasic change. I would like full control. Also I would like a full EQ not just presets. I do enjoy how easy it is to change your background though. It give the Zune a really nice touch. My friends and I trade them at school. One thing that really ticks my off about this player is that there is no FM recording so I have to write down a song I hear on the radio if I want to download it later and there is no clock! I mean come on I can understand no calendar or games but not even a clock! It gets really annoying because I always used my old MP3 player as a clock when Im on the go. Well its time to wind down this review. The Zune software works great and adds album art automaticly to music you already have which is cool. So dont let all of this negative talk stop you from considering the Zune. Its really a great player. I got a 2 year warranty from Best Buy so if it "breaks" (cough-cough)I can get a store credit and get the next gen version or that 6gen iPod im waiting to come out. Sorry this review was so unorganized but I hope my review can help someone whos looking for a hard-drive based MP3 player.. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing video quality and easy to navigate through. The radio antenna is awsome, great reception. Music is easily found and sound quality is great.. 
Cons:. The Software Still Has Bugs. 
Summary:. I went through 3 iPod's (shuffle,mini,video) before I finally got a Zune and it is unbelievable. The sound and video quality is better than I have seen. The radio surprisingly gets extremely good reception where ever I might be. The software is a little slow at times but I have never had a better mp3 player. The accessories are slowly coming out and i cant wait for more to come. The iPod is a horrible mp3 player that is easily corrupted. I am a huge fan of the Zune and will never go back to Apple products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unparalleled Playback for video and audio, userfriendly interface, solid device.. 
Cons:. Zune Marketplace is still a dwarf in this industry, no video or webcast content.. 
Summary:. Well there is a lot of reviews on here that are unfounded because the product wasn't out, and then there are a number of negative feedbacks on here with "1's" which are nothing more than vicious comments by Apple fan boys. Unlike most people here I have owned the iPod Video, iPod Nano, and the Creative Zen and by far the Zune is a superior mobile media device.. With a little bit of research I was able to get a converter and put some of my favorite home owned DVD's on it, as well as my extensive mp3 collection. Podcasts are a dream to put on this thing, and listen to. The customizable backgrounds and user friendly GUI are a great improvements over the iPod. There is nothing I can't do with this thing the the other ones could also do. The screen is bigger than the iPod and the Zen, and I can see the album art clearly, as opposed to the tiny image you need a magnifying glass for on the iPod. I also can wireless share mp3's with my friends. The Zune is not Microsoft's way of copying iPod... seeing as how iPod was NOT the first mp3 player on the market... The Zune is Microsoft's way of IMPROVING the mobile mp3/podcast/video/picture experience.. Maybe I am just lucky but this thing hasn't locked up or glitched once... which is more than I can say for the iPod or the Zen. I highly recommend the Zune for those who really enjoy music, and want the ability to watch videos on a vibrant larger screen, and who like to listen to the radio every now and then without having to shell out another 50 bucks for a gaudy add on.. 9 out of 10!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Seamless install and easy to use. Zune provided me with everything I was looking and the screen is gigantic. It was this or a PSP.. 
Cons:. 3 plays in three days for sharing files is blah.. 
Summary:. After installing the Zune I was syncing my library to the zune in about 30 minutes. Its as simple to use as it looks. I would recommend Zune to anyone looking for a media device...It definitely beats ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger Brighter Screen, FM Tuner, Wi-Fi Capabilities, Easy To Use Transfer Software, Converts files to fit automatically, Magnetic headphones. 
Cons:. Needs 2 Zunes for Wi-Fi, EQ is not as good as the Ipod. 
Summary:. A great all around player for the bginner or Mp3 Ace, more features than the Ipod bigger screen, better battery, wirelessly transfer music, I HIGHLY reccomend it. With an Ipod, if a file didn`t fit, I had to use another program to convert it, but with the zune, it does it for you while updating.. 

$$;
Pros:. It sounds great! I looks cool! It is very customizeable! It syncs easy.. 
Cons:. It doesn't have many accesories yet . It could have come out sooner.. 
Summary:. I like to stick with what works for me- Ford, Microsoft, Canon, Sony, and Dell to name a few. I wanted a Dell DJ, but held off after I heard about them breaking a lot. I felt really confident with the Zune because it is a Microsoft product and they do some good things, XP, Vista, Smart Card, etc. They do some bad too, but hey thats life. I do like fact that my Son can be the back drop for my Zune and that always perks me up. It keeps a good charge. It lulls me to sleep on the bus. It is everything I wanted in an MP3 player and nothing I didn't. I played around with many iPods, but never liked the interface. It is, dare I say, too Apple-y. I like Windows Media Player, so the Zune Software and WMP like interface suits me right down to the ground. I do like it better with the Sony MDR-J20 head phones over the Zune Premium head phones. I like having options, and big named ones are even better! You may call me a fan boy, I don't care, but it is just an MP3 player, right? It plays my music and it sports the name I like. I haven't had any problems loading my music other than re-categorizing my tunes correctly so that I don't see "Audio Adrenline" and "Audio Adrenaline" or assume that Bachman-Turner Overdrive sang "American Band".. 

$$;
Pros:. ZUNE Pass is manna from heaven. 
Cons:. Stutters on some songs when on battery mode. 
Summary:. It's been 3 months since I received my ZUNE for Christmas, completely unsuspected as I had never mentioned that I desired an MP3 player. Everyone I knew had an iPod but I was adament that I NEVER desired one, because I want to put my money elsewhere than buying songs for .99 a piece.. Now, 3 months after owning one, I have bought two addtional ones as gifts, as I'm so impressed with the ZUNE. One is for a fellow Luddite friend of mine that (like me) is still in the vinyl-mindset. The other was for my daughter, who owns an iPod and already has sunk $750.00 worth of music into it. When my daugher saw my Zune and heard about the Zune Pass, I could see the lust in her eyes. So, for her birthday, I got her a black Zune and am paying for the Zune Pass. In 3 weeks time, she's filled up 21 GB of her Zune, downloading albums of songs that she couldn't afford through iPod.. Many complainers of Zune mention that there aren't any video selections. This feature is NOT a problem with me or the two people that I gave them to because none of us desire to watch videos of ANYTHING on our MP3 player. What has turned out as a bonus feature, for me, however, is the incredible photo storage capacity and large screen of the Zune. I own a design firm and instead of dragging my laptop to the clients, I download finished project photos onto my Zune, and then have a slide show for them. I think I've generated more interest in the Zune from THIS application than even the music storage capacity! Then, when I'm done with the Show &#38; Tell, I delete the photos from my Zune so I don't tie up storage space! This feature alone is worth $1000's of dollars to me.. Regarding the stuttering of the Zune when it plays some songs: I know this is a glitch that Zune admits to but they haven't been able to correct it, yet. It's evident when you listen to the Zune via battery. However, it's been discovered that if you keep the display as "Always On" when you listen via battery, that this stuttering stops. Since I only listen to my Zune via my cat stereo or Altec Lansing, they are always plugged into a charger, which automatically has them "always on". Therefore, stuttering is NOT an issue for me. However, I can see for the person who uses their Zune to commute to work, that it might be irksome.. All said, if Zune goes out of business or they quit the Zune Pass, I'll never get another MP3 player to replace it, unless they too have an unlimited access pass. Now, I can't wait for the 80 GB Zune to come out so I can download ALL of my albums to it plus tap into their Market Place.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good hardware. 
Cons:. so so software. 
Summary:. I was an IPOD believer until I bought the Zune. This dude is very good except for the software. Takes some getting used to after dealing with ITunes for years. No video content available yet but that will change shortly. IMHO, this thing is better than the IPOD, especially with the larger screen and landscape mode.. 

$$;
Pros:. lovely screen, great video and audio quality/playback.. 
Cons:. not enough people are smart enough to have one. 
Summary:. they still prefer the iPod, purely based on peer pressure. But having sent a song to a girl i didn't know on the shuttle to campus, i must say, its pretty sexy. and the ability to watch videos in widescreen aspect as well as the huge album art when a song is playing is nice as well. I love my Zune. also, the experience is better seeing as Microsoft make the Zune and controls the Zune software. Not as unreliable as Napster with some random MP3 players device. It just works.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video, audio, radio. 
Cons:. No video in Zune Marketplace. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, zune marketplace , fm radio, audio great. 
Cons:. no video yet...install problems at begining. 
Summary:. So i got my Zune a few days back. I was going nutz comparing all mp3's. Wife has a Nano which is cool but man she totally wants a Zune Now. The Zune Marketplace is great. Everything runs really well. I had some hard time at install but working like a champ now. Spoke with Tech support for 2 hrs and after talking he said they are almost donw wrapping up talks with some of the big studios and within the next few months expect Video baby....Also i cant wait to Zune my stuff to my Xbox 360. Going online next week for the first time...Love this little player....Good start for MS. 

$$;
Pros:. EVIRYTHING ( But thear are Cons). 
Cons:. If Microsoft won't add Video they should mack it Univiseol so I could use a differnt service (A.K.A. Vongo, Unbox ect.). 
Summary:. I love this divice ( I have the brown one) and it does to some-extent look like a TURD but I keep it in an awsome Camo-Case I found as a Target Excluseve all of ya'll (What I live in south Missasippi don't lafe) I wish it was Plays-for-Shure if MS won't sell video but to come soon I mange my Music in such a way in WMP that zune will pick it up. REMEMBER DON'T STEAT (A.K.A. PIREATE) MUSIC. 

$$;
Pros:. HUGE screen, brilliant images, awesome interface. 
Cons:. Zune software. 
Summary:. This is a spectacular product. Microsoft's first is a winner. It's better than the iPod in almost every way. It beats the iPod in screen size. It has a radio. Wireless capabilities with Zune to Zune file transfers. (Stop complaining about the 3 time/3 day limit. What other mp3 player do you have that can do better?) The only thing that I can complain about is the software. You cannot buy videos on Zune Marketplace (Zune's version of iTunes) YET. I have spoken with Zune representatives, and they assure me that Microsoft is working that out. It is a new product, and they are having to get the copyright issues worked out. There is a solution though. Try getting MyZunevideos, ZuneReactor, or Zune Downloads Unlimited. For a one time fee of about $40 you can download as much music, movies, tv shows, sports, you name it as you want. The Zune has been referred to as "The iPod killer.". 

$$;
Pros:. Solid design, Beautiful sound, Quick Selection Response. 
Cons:. Limited Accessories, software can be a little buggy but is not a showstopper.. 
Summary:. I bought my Zune about 3 weeks ago. I decided that I'd rather have an mp3 player with a large hard drive than a 1 gig flash player. My music taste varies quite often and my zune is fully capable of supporting that. I have about 2000 songs on this thing and thats more than enough music that I need to work out to or just chill and listen to. What I love about my Zune is its responsiveness. Microsoft has done a nice job with choosing a processor that does a more than capable job. Its apparent that they did their homework and did a good job with testing. Being an engineer myself, I know how important it is to build a good foundation. So what if its limited to fewer formats than others. If you do a comparison with others in its class, you'll find that while the Zune supports three music formats the others support 4. Big deal!!! I only listen to mp3's and wma's anyways. In fact I've traded songs with a friend of mine who owns a Zen mp3 player (no you are not limited to the music from the market place as most folks believe is the gospel.) Today I bought a travel pack because I travel alot. Although the original headphones that came with it are nice I really like the premium headphones. They have a real nice bass response and they're very comfortable.. I would like to give the zune a 10 but I do have a couple of grips about the product. Although it is new your choice of accessorize are limited. The other grip I had was that the software needs alittle work. When I first tried to load it, it froze up. My second attempt was more favorable so it wasn't a showstopper.. 

$$;
Pros:. Synchs to Windows, Plays WMA's, Playlists, EASY. 
Cons:. Pics view slightly slow,. 
Summary:. I have had my Zune for 2 weeks now and really like it! I finally bought a new truck (Avalanche) and can now hook my Zune directly into the head unit and play all my songs. No more CD's!!! I purchased the Monster Cables and the Zune Car Charger and everything works without a hitch. Oh, and downloading my entire library, which consists of over 20 Gigs of music, and a ton of pics, was super EASY. I basically just followed the on screen prompts and walked off for a little bit while my entire library of .wma's transferred over. I have not utilized the zune marketplace yet, I am still a little old school and like to own the CD in the event .wma or .mp3 is replaced by a higher quality music format. So, I still purchase all of my music off of Amazon.com. All 20+ Gigs of my library is legit, ripped from CD's. Also, the playlists I have on my Windows Media Player downloaded and work!. I have owned a Toshiba Gigabeat S and a 1 Gig Samsung, both of which I like. I have never owned an Ipod, so I cannot comment about the comparisons.... In summary, my Zune is exactly what I expected and feels like a solid product. I use it primarily for driving pleasure, but have also used it for business travel and such (airplane). Great Product. Can't wait for new versions and hopefully someday be capable of using something like this as a phone, computer, or whatever amazing thing Microsoft (et al) comes up with!. 

$$;
Pros:. very large display. 
Cons:. wifi limited. 
Summary:. I've the zune for three weeks know, an the only cons is when you transfer music its a 3day or 3 play thing, also they could have made it where you can purchase music from the marketplace from the device itself using wifi.thats the only problem i have, other then that i love my zune.maybe some day they will release a firmware update to the marketplace download from the device... 

$$;
Pros:. The screen is very bright and large. The buttons are far superior to ipod's and creative's touch things (very destistable). great user interface.. 
Cons:. zune software has some issues and the screen isn't the best resolution i've ever seen.. 
Summary:. When I first got this mp3 player I had no problems installing it and syncing it up with my music library. The player works great and I'm happy with every thing about it. However, zune market place needs some work. It also shares a good UI, but I HATE having to prebuy points. But this didn't turn out to be a problem with me at all because it would not accept my credit card. I called zune and there is "nothing they can do." My credit card works perfectly every where else and I double checked the numbers several times. If you want to buy music iTunes is the better option. However, the player function is more important to me than the software that I rarely use, so I still give it a 9. I'm sure the credit card issues are just native to my specific case.. 

$$;
Pros:. large screen, simple interface, built in wifi, built in radio. 
Cons:. wifi is pretty limited. 
Summary:. I will start off by saying that I do not own an Ipod, so I cannot compare the two. The screen on this device is great, I often find myself tempted to watch movies instead of the road during trips. Converting my music, pictures and videos is quick and easy. Sound quality is great even when using my fm transmitter in the car. I guess my one gripe is that the wifi is pretty much a novelty right now. I was hoping to connect to my router or to my pc, but as of now it's not happening.. Overall a great product with even greater potential.. 

$$;
Pros:. Video friendly 3" LCD screen looks widescreen. 
Cons:. Initial software install but well worth the hassel !!!. 
Summary:. I bought my Zune a few days before X-mas after finishing my shopping for everyone else. It was time for my gift to myself.. I have had other MP3 players, ZEN nano, but none had video. This is my first video player.I thus can't compare it to a POD but what I have come to see it scores high by having a much much larger screen, WiFi , plays on home television, FM radio, and upgradable software. There is also a 80 gig hard drive available for the unit but you have to take the unit apart and install it.. Now after owning my ZUNE for a little under a month I LOVE IT !!! I have imported over 3000 pics \ wallpapers that plays slideshow while the music plays. I have about 2000 mp3 songs uploaded on my ZUNE.I have 120 high quality music videos uploaded also. I have only used 9 gigabytes of the 30 gigabytes available. No need for that 80 gig drive yet. I obtained all this data from the great free internet information sharing without paying any recurring or extra fees.. The ZUNE is a great Microsoft Media player with Toshiba Gigabeat hardware combination .The ZUNE is constructed of a rubberized translucent plastic which feels very good in your hands. The controls are very easy to use ( play/pause, volume, fast forward, rewind, next, previous, enter). If you are looking for an Apple iPod alternative ,take a Microsoft ZUNE for a test drive. You wont be dissapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen, clear and smooth video, easy to use interface, ruggid casing, FM tuner, reliable software. 
Cons:. Accessories slow to come to market, no compatibility yet with car audio, no 80 Gig HD yet. 
Summary:. I own two iPods and an iTunes cell phone. I got my Zune this past Christmas. At first i wanted to return it and get the iPod video. You know....the hype. Everyone says how much the Zune sucks. Well I gave it a chance. I LOVE IT!! I've been glued to it for the past month. I went to look at an iPod video the other day and the screen was sooooooooo small. Reading text and distinguishing features on video was much more difficult on the iPod.. The latest version of iTunes is a nightmare! I've had to install that crap at least 5 times and I still get the ocassional error screen. The Zune's software has NEVER been a problem. It took a good while to download off of the disc but ever since then, its been very smooth. That might have to do with the fact that a software company created it.. The casing on my iPod looks like i've tossed it around in a sand box!! Its scratched really badly. The Zune casing seems much more rugid and much less prone to have the same scratching that you get with the iPod.. The FM tuner is great. I guess thats why iPod is the only MP3 player out there that doesnt have it. I take this thing to the gym and either watch a movie while riding the bike or tune the FM into the televisions. I take it to work and listen to the local talk shows. When a show comes on that I dont like, I start listening to my MP3s. Its great!. The interface on the iPod is pretty easy to use. So is the Zune's. However the Zune's interface just seems so much more interesting. To start off, you can add any of your pictures as your background. The menus are very well laid out and easy to understand.. All in all...I love my iPod. But since i've gotten the Zune, the iPod just seems like a toy. The Zune can do every single thing that the iPod video can do....and a LOT more.. Other than the accessories why would you buy an iPod?. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing sound quality, Easy to use, beautiful picture and video display, awesome radio play, sharing with other zune users. 
Cons:. bigger then the latest players, problems loading software in beginning, not many accessories currently but finding more and more (Ipod started off slow too). 
Summary:. I have had my zune since the 2nd day it was released, I saw it on display and played around with it for a little while. I was going to pick up a ipod nano because before the zune I had the imfamous ipod mini. Well truthfully I was happy with my ipod till the oh so certain death of its battery and other mechanical problems all mini's eventually faced. Ipod seems to have a history of having products that just happen to die the moment a new generation comes out, so I really didnt want to deal with that with my new MP3 player. So I came to the decision to buy the zune. My only 2 complaints were the first issues I had with it. I already knew about the first, the size was bigger then I was initially shooting for but its surprisingly not that heavy its just bulky which with me is probably good, its easy to hold in your hands and because of its size it has a nice big screen (I am addicted to looking at all my pictures and showing them off to friends). The second which I will warn to all of you who do not do automatic updates on their Windows you will have to update the service pack before being able to use your Zune if you purchase one. I got very frustrated but in all honestly its not their fault it was mine for not keeping my system up to date. After I installed all windows updates the software installed on my computer and I was ready to go. Now the next burning question was whether or not my media files from my ipod would be able to transfer automatically to the zune or would I start from scratch. Needless to say it did ALL the work for me that was a HUGE plus for me since I have over 800 songs and easily 100 CDs loaded onto my Ipod. The software to load the music onto the device is extremely easy to use and much easier to organize songs and files around then itunes ever was.. Well thats enough about the software, time for the device itself. Like I said the device is bulky and bigger then most would prefer so if a big MP3 player isnt what you want please stay clear and get something you would be comfortable with. But the bonus to it is the bigger screen which is very clear and very smooth when it comes to video play and its much easier to hold and operate in your hand without losing grip. I love the material of the body, its a non slick plastic that doesnt scratch and seems durable when dropped (havent dropped mine yet "knocks on wood"). The controls on this are SOOOO easy! Very basic and not confusing to operate, the only downfall is if your a previous ipod user you find yourself trying to roll your finger on the control pad but you get used to it. The wireless feature on this device is fun, I already connected with many people sharing music and getting pictures. The songs you only get to listen to 3 times within 3 days but the pictures you can keep, I havent exchanged videos yet. The radio is very nice feature to have when you just dont know what you want to listen to, and if you get a good frequency and the radio station is digital it will tell you the name of the station and the song its playing. The radio though I do have difficulty with but only in buildings which is understandable and I have no gripes on. The videos like I said awesome quality! The music quality is SOOOOO MUCH BETTER THEN IPOD!!!!!!!!! I hear the creative labs are better which I dont know too much about that, my mom got a creative v plus for christmas (she wanted small) its nice but I like the zune better. The headphones what come with it are perfect for me, but I might try for higher quality ones to get the full potential of the zune.. Ok I hope I helped someone, the only other negative to the zune is accessories, not many out but since it came out there has already been 25% more then started out, but hello people remember when the ipod came out and any other mp3 players? They had no accessories like they do today, so just give it a chance if thats what is keeping you from it. All in all I gave it a 9 because in all honesty no player is perfect but this is pretty darn close. I repeat this isnt a device good for everyone so if you buy it for yourself or as a gift make sure you know what you want, how much memory you would acutally need and the size that is right for you. I wish you luck in your search for MP3 player!. 

$$;
Pros:. screen size, interesting interface, reliability.. 
Cons:. ...nothing yet.. 
Summary:. I was waiting for my mp3 player to die before the replacement plan ran out. Luckily it happened so i went to best buy and replaced my mp3 player with a zune. I hadn't read anything about it but it looked cool at best buy and i liked how it was easy to use. I didn't have any problems installing the software and I haven't had a problem with my Zune for the month and a half that i have had it. Obviously, there is a possiblity that something can go wrong, that's what a replacement plan is for. Before buying the zune, i didn't have any preference for an mp3 player but after the abuse for buying the zune, i am leaning on the zune side. No other mp3 players have created such a stir as the zune...why? Because it is the first real competitor to the ipod from a big company. The only people you will hear complaining about the zune will be biased towards to ipod. The ipod works fine but it has had its share of problems so it's not fair to trash talk the zune. I didn't buy it because of song transfer option, I have all of the songs i want and i can buy a new cd if i want more. The zune is good, the ipod is good, but all of the ipod people need to relax and hope that the ipod can stay at the top. As for me, i am going to listen to my zune and go to bed.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use and sound quality. 
Cons:. Larger, still some format issues, video material scarce. 
Summary:. I have owned the IPOD for a number of years. I am not a mainstream music enthusiast, I am mostly interested in opera.. While I have generally liked the ipod, I have had frequent problems with the software. I have also not liked ITUNES because the volume of classical music was limited.. I am much happier with the Zune. I am running VISTA and Zune works fine with it. I found the sound quality a bit better than the IPOD, the sofware MUCH easier to work with, and it has been extremely easy to add music files from a variety of libraries.. Classical music selection from Zune Marketplace is adequate for now.. For just getting out of the gate, the Zune is doing just fine.. Caution, some older computers might have problems with the Zune software. Some earlier USB versions may not work with the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen size, menu, syncing songs, and online service. 
Cons:. External interface controls need some minor improvments. 
Summary:. The first generation of the Zune player and online music store is very good. The Zune player menu is well organized and easy to use. The screen size is very nice and crisp/clear. Syncing songs with the Zune software is easy and fast. The click wheel lacks the creativity found in the iPod controls, needs improvment. The Zune online store allows unlimited downloads with a monthly subscription, very nice! However, the online store lacks videos, TV shows, and movies found on iTunes. Hopefully this is a future addition to the service. You can use iTunes to download Pod Casts, which can be auto synced into the Zune library and downloaded to the Zune device. Once the Zune online store adds movies, TV shows, and music videos its goodbye to the iPod. Great first gen device and online store.. 

$$;
Pros:. read the review!!. 
Cons:. read the review!!. 
Summary:. I recently bought a Zune from ebay just before christmas- My god!!! it's amazing!! I was so suprised.. From research and other reviews, I thought it would be large and heavy- however, it was smaller and lighter than i'd expected. The most noticable feature was probaby the screen, but i was quite annoyed that i had to charge it first before I i could watch anything =P as soon as it had charged fully, i inserted the driver/setup disk into my laptop. It's overall incredibly easy to setup- although slightly confusing when windows live is introduced.. however i was overshrouded with excitement, therefore i wasn't really thinking straight =D The next thing i noticed was the player itself (zune media player). Many reviews suggested that the software was buggy and really not very thought out.. i'm honestly appauled at their opinion. Firstly it's ultra cool! In a black and orange colour scheme, yet with a small 'tab like' screen in the top right corner, which means that you can see the videos or films that your playing whilst scrolling through your media library!! It may seem very pointless.. But comon'!! it looks so cool! =D Another amazing factor of the software is the syncing speed.. it's unbelievably fast! I timed 0.23 second's per song! and i don't care how slow that may sound- but that's quick enough! after syncing some music to my zune, i added a music video (mp4), which took a short while be converted in the zune media player, however no longer than 2-3 minutes. I unplugged the usband turned it on.. The (well i think it's called UIF..) user inter-face..'? well scrolling through the media on your zune is so well thought out! I'ts smooth and cleverly designed, yet still looking cool and fashionable.. another thing (that as far as i know the ipod doesn't have), is that you have the ability to use a picture as a background, even whilst scrolling through the media on your zune. so this means that you can scroll through your songs with something else to look at other than.. well white (which in my opinion looks so boring..) and even though the pictures are viewed in landscape across the screen, the zune sets them to potrait if you choose them as a background, WITHOUT distorting the picture!!! unless its of poor quality or resolution, however I've not come across this problem yet =/ I've stumbled across one problem, of which i consider to be a disapointment, only towards my own fellings towards sound and music. And that is the sound settings/equalizer.. There aren't that many to choose from, and the other thing is that they're already set out for.. It would of been nice to have a 7 or even 5 stage equalizer to play around with.. Still, the presets sound good and match the music you listen to. Personally i find that the 'Acoustic setting' sounds quite nice.. The picture quality is amazing!! My friend has an ipod video, and not even HE can't tell the difference!! There's so much more i could mention.. however i'm bored and hungry ( XD ) hehe.. any questions about the zune and other stuff i haven't mentioned that you'd like to query me about, right a review commenting on mine and let me know... Regards Ky xx.

Pros:. Big, beautiful screen, great software, interface, FM radio. 
Cons:. A bit heavy, cant convert some video formats. 
Summary:. Hey, this is an easy one. If you need something small for the gym - go get an iPod shuffle. If you want the best portable media player, the Zune is the clear choice. Its large screen is far superior to the iPod and Zune's software blows the lousy iTunes out of the water. After installing the software it automatically found all of my media (yes, including some I may have acquired via less than ideal means) and it automatically downloaded the album info, album art, etc. The way it organized everything was just amazing. The FM radio is a nice touch too.. I have just one beef so far. For some reason it cannot automatically convert some video formats. I have same AVI files and it simply wont let me put them in my library. That means I have to find some other software to do the conversions. Oh well, its worth it for the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice big screen, simple control, many shortcuts, great supporting software, shows that microsoft learned from the others, does what it is supposed to, nifty "extras", great organization. 
Cons:. limited accessories, bigger than some "pocket players". 
Summary:. I bought my Zune over a week ago, but wanted to get some time with it before I provided a review. Before I bought it, I did plenty of research and read numerous reviews on this site. I spent most of my time looking at the reviews of 5 and lower, as I wanted to know what people were fussing about. I must say, that I have been delightfully impressed with the Zune, and most of that is because I knew what I was getting with this MP3 player. One of my main concerns, was getting a player that could show/store pictures. I didn't want a small screen, and the Zune delivers with a nice and large screen that you turn 90 degrees for viewing. The buttons are easy to use and very "purposeful". I think there are plenty of reviews that tell all of the other great things, so I will spend a little time debunking some of the "complaints".. First off, the wireless abilities were added to give a little more capabilities to this player. Yes, you can only keep "shared" songs for 3 days or 3 plays, but that is only because the record companies don't want people giving away music. It would be a wireless version of Kazaa otherwise. I don't see this feature as a "con", but rather a "pro" because, even being limited, it is far more than any other MP3 player. What you CAN do, is flag the tracks that you get transferred to your Zune, and download them when you get home. The Zune software even reminds you that you have some flagged music.. Not having a scroll-wheel doesn't seem to make it any more difficult to navigate the Zune either. I've never owned an iPod and I don't understand the hard-on that people get over the scroll-wheel. If you hold the button down on the Zune, it will scroll faster, and a large letter will appear to the right of the screen letting you know what part of the alphabet you are on in your list. In my opinion (and that of an iPod owner) it is better than the scroll wheel, particularly because it is more accurate when scrolling just one or two places.. It is big, bigger than an iPod video too, but I don't see that really giving an advantage to the iPod (or any other mp3/video player), as all of them are significantly larger than the Nano and other "tiny" players. If you are needing a very compact player, this isn't for you.. The resolution on the screen is the same as the iPod video, but is larger, so this does mean a slightly lower video quality. I, however, will gladly sacrifice the negligable difference in video quality for that awesomely larger screen. I have an HD TV at home for "quality videos".. The Zune software for your PC is great too. It is pretty intuitive, easy to find songs, and interfaces with Windows Media Player. Playlists that I had entered in my WMP were automatically created for the Zune as well. Furthermore, for a flat rate, you can have unlimited access to all of the available music on Zune. You do have the option of downloading songs at 79 cents a piece as well. So far, Frank Zappa is the only artist that I haven't been able to get.. Overall, this does everything that it is supposed to. I haven't found much (if anything) that Microsoft should have or could have done better. I think a lot of people look towards what some of the features could do if there were no regulations in place, but when you logically think about it, there is proper execution on Microsoft's part. For $249.99, you are getting everything that the other players in this price range have, plus a great interface for your PC, wireless sharing, FM radio, and a nice big picture. Kudos to Microsoft for making a wonderful player with some great capabilities.. 

$$;
Pros:. wi-fi, 30 GB, clear video, bright, beautiful display. 
Cons:. battery life. 
Summary:. Its just awesome. battery life is kinda crappy but not horrible. 

$$;
Pros:. Um, everything,. 
Cons:. I cant get it in any bright colors like yellow. 
Summary:. Well there isnt much to say, this thing is great! It even tells you the song names that are playing on the built in fm tuner. I with there were more speaker docks for it. Also if this were made by apple no one would be crying about the old 3 day 3 play thing, they would say apple is super! But sorry Ipod this one is better and the sooner people accept that this world will be a better place.. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen, simple contols, EQ, easy to use,. 
Cons:. Not much aftermarke support, YET, Sofware takes some getting use to,. 
Summary:. First of all, I've never owned an I-pod so I can't tell you which one is better but this is definately not my first MP3 player. The zune is not hard to use at all as far as the controls go. The screen is huge compard to other multimedia player I've owned and the I-pod. It sounds awesome. Very loud and clear. I have over 20 GB on my desktop and I trasfered it all seamlessly to the zune. It did douple folder some of the albums but it was an easy fix. Videos were clear and sharp with no skipping or stutturing. I love it what else can I say. I went back and forth for a long time between the zune and the I-pod and after much research I settled on the zune and I'm not disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wi-fi (limited for now), great interface, FM tuner, nice design. 
Cons:. Zune marketplace is cumbersome and buggy. 
Summary:. I'm neither a Zune of iPod fanboy and i honestly couldn't tell you which one is better but I have not put my Zune down since I got it as a gift. It appears to have a more user friendly interface than the iPod does. I like that I can put my own wallpaper on it. Hopefully the wi-fi limitations will be addressed with firmware updates in the future. It would be nice to download music straight from the player instead of synching with the computer. Zune Marketplace does need a little work. Movies should be downloadable from it in the future. The Zune works great with the Xbox 360 as well. Battery life is so-so but to all the people complaining about it, instead of holding the play/pause button down for 3 secs to turn it off, you can do a full shutdown of the unit by holding the directional button in a down position and holding the back arrow simultaneously for 3 seconds. This helps conserve battery life as the unit is fully shut down and not just in standby mode. Thanks to zunescene.com for that tip. Overall i'm very pleased with the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. Perfect screen size = not to big, not too small .... 
Cons:. needs more video playback options (ex. Vongo support). 
Summary:. Very simple to use. I love the finish and 2nd color around the edge. The zune is a great alternative to the iPod (larger screen/easier operation), and a better choice over other mp3 players out there in the same price range.. build: solid - exterior finish is top notch. sound: very clear - amongst the best of them. picture: amazing - love the size and clarity. I also like that it comes with an FM radio and you can customize it's display. The ability to use it as an external harddrive would have been nice, but I've got thumbdrives for that. I would have also liked to have seen lossless audio support and downloadable video content at it's own zune marketplace(zune's version of iTunes), but all in all, an excellent product. Very happy owner. * HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *. 

$$;
Pros:. radio, big screen, menu. 
Cons:. could have more video and music formats and more features. 
Summary:. I think the ZUNE is really nice. I suggest it to all. The more foramats kils me. but that could be easily updated. Way better than the ipod (no duhh). It is tied with the creative Zen vision: M but I would rather go with the zune becuase it is more newer and easy to update and the software is fantastic. 

$$;
Pros:. The features. 
Cons:. The Zune Marketplace. 
Summary:. As I first saw the Zune, I was totally interested in buying it. Next, I was thinking if it was worth the money. Now, I am happy that I bought it. The music feature is very excellent, giving you the album picture, and if you don't have it, it will have a color screen. If you want to, you can send it to any other Zune senders. Which leads me to the next feature, the wireless connection. I can not tell you how the connection is because no one else that lives near me has the Zune. The radio is decent, giving you an okay reception. I only have a few stations where they tell you the station and what you are listening to. What I use the most is the video feature. The feature is excellent and has a very clear viewing screen (3 inches). You can import all of your videos, songs and pictures from iTunes and Windows Media Player. Pictures are viewed just as well as videos are. Also, you can use your pictures as a background by selecting it when viewing it, and it says, place as background. The Zune Marketplace is very desirable to use, but it is very difficult to start with. The first thing that happened when we installed the program was that it imported all of my music, videos, and pictures from my iTunes, and you didn't have to press a button, you don't have to press import or anything. The hard thing about the Marketplace is syncing the video or song onto your Zune. You have to put it on you now playing list, then you go to the options section and you go to sync/sync "now playing to _______" (your Zune name). The upsetting thing to me is that the Zune Marketplace only has songs, and no videos. Overall, this system is absolutely excellent and I hope to keep it for a long time.. 

$$;
Pros:. FM Radio, Nice screen, great sound, good software. 
Cons:. not many accessories yet such as speakers etc.... 
Summary:. I was leary from all the press and reviews written about hte zune being ugly, bulky, stores don't display it properly, can't try before you buy like an apple store etc... But keeping a open mind I found some fair reviews and decided because of the FM radio and big video display to give it a try. It was easy to snyc my exsisting music "non protected" and rip my other albums. It even synced some full feature video that I owned. I work in a downtown 15 story steel building were I could barely pickup FM with a desktop radio the Zune did a better job to my surprise. My favorite station broadcasts the song title and author and the Zune displays that info which it good since DJ's rarely announce credits.. I like to make movies and slide shows and the Zune is excellent for playing back. I also have martial arts tapes of my forms so when I am practicing and forget somemoves I can review my Katas.. If your buying an MP3 for the firsttime or upgrading I would look at the Zune.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great video, easy to navigate. 
Cons:. limited on download sources. 
Summary:. Overall I think the Zune is great. I would purchase it again and for someone else.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has bigger and better screen than ipod, easy to use, good radio reception and is not a copy off the ipod. 
Cons:. Thicker than ipod but better so it doesn't bother me. 
Summary:. Has everything i need and it has a better amplifier than my ipod and bigger and better screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. super fast response. 
Cons:. i really dont have any :P. 
Summary:. one word... awesome. i have owned my fair share of pods. i have 4 at the moment... a shuffle, photo, video and nano (2nd gen product red).. nothing comes close to the speed of the zune. it is so fast switching tracks and browsing through the menu system. somehow microsoft has managed to get a HDD device to respond faster than my brand new flash memory nano...?. radio function i find super handy and can't live without it now.. if you're deciding between the pod of the zune, have faith in me... this is the first review response i have ever typed and i'm not typing for fun :P. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture and sound quailty!. 
Cons:. Battery life isn't the quailty I'd like, but I'm on my computer almost 24/7 so I can always charge it.. 
Summary:. I think the Zune is one amazing MP3 player. I'm out of town a lot, and having the ability to have picture of my family, friends, and great times all saved on my Zune, along with my favorite music, makes my trips seem to fly by. The picture quality in such a small screen is unbelievable, and what is really nice is the videos, music, and pictures that were uploaded thanks to Microsoft.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big Screen and quality of the audio.. 
Cons:. Not too many accesories yet. But soon to change with time.. 
Summary:. The Zune is great and it doesn't have useless features that are found in other MP3 players like a notepad. I mean...who uses a notepad in thier MP3 player anyway? Get a life if you do.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great sound, super easy to use, great screen. 
Cons:. WLAN is lame, Zune Marketplace needs more content. 
Summary:. I imagine that if iTunes offered subscription music, I would have bought an iPod a long time ago. But it doesn't, so I didn't. I struggled with an iRiver and Yahoo Music and later Urge, but the combination fell short on functionality, battery life, capacity, etc.. The Zune plus the Zune Marketplace solved all of those issues. It is very intuitive and the interaction with the Zune Marketplace is very seamless. Most of all, it sounds excellent.. Many reviews have discussed the shortcomings of Zune and the Zune Marketplace. I agree with those assessments but take heart that all can be corrected via software and content improvements. I don't think I'll have to buy a new player for a long time.. I don't care if it is an "iPod Killer" or not. The simple fact is that I don't want to pay for individual songs. I'll happily pay the subscription fee and download all I want.. My specific wants are a richer way of exploring new music and more functionality of the WLAN. I doubt that I'll ever share songs wirelessly but would like to synch wirelessly and maybe even access the web.. I doubt this will happen, but if CNET could delete all the reviews of people who obviously haven't actually used the Zune, that would be nice so potential users could get a true vote. Folks, this is just a dumb little $250 toy, it's not a religious movement.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Sound and Picture. 
Cons:. The software Sucks. 
Summary:. The Zune itself is a great little player and I am banking on the fact the the firmware will have better improvements in the future, otherwise this player will go by the wayside real soon, Microsoft really screwed up by letting it out this soon, I mean I know the rush to get it out before the holidays but it seems as though the software is only have completed, no movies, and no way to convert media center recorded TV shows.... I am fortunate that I can convert programs over but the average person won't have the programs to do it or want to for that matter.... anyway just my opinion all I can say is time will tell if this is going to make it.... but for now I am really glad I got one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great screen, great software, wireless sharing, basically everything but the weight. 
Cons:. the weight-battery. 
Summary:. The zunewas the best purchase ive made. this completely blows away the ipod. 

$$;
Pros:. Both of my kids can use wi-fi. Very easy to transfer videos from Windows Movie Maker.. 
Cons:. Limited colors and slightly larger than IPod. 
Summary:. One of my sons wanted an IPod for the holiday the other wanted a Zune. Personally I decided to get a Zune for myself. In the end after opening the gifts both sons wanted the Zunes so I got the IPod. They seem to like them, which is what counts. The screen is a plus, it is large enough to see videos clearly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen Quality Sound quality great great video playback. 
Cons:. Somewhat big but not to big. 
Summary:. Love the screen size to view pictures or to view videos on. You can charge you Zune while you have it connected to your computer and unlike Ipod's you can listen to your music while it's charging.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great User Interface, Wonderful FM Radio, Sturdy/Well Built, Awesome Marketplace, Great Sound, Large Hard Drive. 
Cons:. When deleting files from your library to free room for new ones, the songs unsync from the player. 
Summary:. I was a little skeptical at first about this player due to reviews from large companies, but the more I read consumer reviews, the more I wanted to give this player a try.. I couldn't be more happier with any other purchase.. I have never owned an iPOD in my life, just a couple of small memory MP3 players with text displays. I wanted an alternative to having to move around my cd collection from in and out of my car, and buying an in-dash MP3/CD player seemed out of the question. This player does a wonderful job of taking care of what I want.. You know when you pull it out of the box, that it's going to be a great player. It has some weight to it, looks great (I bought a black one), and feels great. The software was easy to set up, and I was downloading music onto the player within 10 minutes. It comes with a 15-day trial pass to the Marketplace, but once you realize what all they have to offer, you'll want to keep it. The player has options for different EQ settins, which can dramatically increase your listen experience, and the built in FM tuner is fantastic. I'm pretty sure the tuner is the best one that I have ever used, and it supports stations that send out information on the songs being played on the display.. My only complaint was that I couldn't keep the songs on the player if I deleted them from my computer. I have limited space on my laptop, which means that I would have to shuffle around what I wanted on the player at certain times. I got around this by using an external hard drive, and I got over my snafu right quick.. I have yet to try out the wireless function due to me not having anyone around me who owns another ZUNE, but I've heard it's pretty simple to use. The video on the display is sharp and bright, and the picture viewer is great, as well. I like the fact that it displays the album art for the music that you are listening to. Something small, but nice to have.. All in all, I recommend this device to anyone who is looking for a great MP3 player. I'm not going to compare it to an iPOD, since I've never owned one, but I'm sure that they are great players, too.. Microsoft and Toshiba have done a great job on this player for their first attempt (together as a team), and it can only get better from here.. 9.2 out of 10. 

$$;
Pros:. You are able to send Music to others. 
Cons:. A little thick. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Screen, Easy Navigation, Excellent sound, FM tuner nice touch, software easy to use esp using subscription plan, Awsome Xbox 360 integration - it will stream both from the player &#38; software. 
Cons:. No Divx play back, Does not play MSN music store DRM. 
Summary:. I have a Zen Vision :M to compare. The zune is far superior to the zune in every way except for Divx playback and size. The Zune screen really seals the deal. If you have an Xbox 360, this thing is really sweet. It will play music, video, pictures from both the pc software and the zune. This includes all DRM music purchased or through their subscription. I have tried Rhapsody's subscription plan for my Zen and is was a really pain. Zune.net is really easy to find music and upload is a simple.. I have not had any experience with the wireless sharing feature..

Pros:. I love the interface, sund is crisp and clear.

Pros:. Easy to use, looks great, great sound!. 
Cons:. Little bit big, not enough accessories yet.. 
Summary:. I used to have everything ipod. I liked my ipod video. However, I also like microsoft, so because I addicted to electronics bought the zune. Man it is so much better! The click wheel works, I dont need to fumble with it, the screen is nice and large and easy to read (except in bright sun light as with all devices like this), it looks cool! Changed for now!. 

$$;
Pros:. Case feels sturdy, screen size, All my hard work creating movies for ipod transfered over without me manually selecting them. stock headphones are comfy, sound N picture quality great!. 
Cons:. Marketplace needs podcasts section added, oh and videos when are those available? transfer movies from xbox360??. 
Summary:. Formats are good enough for me, AVI mp4 mp3 acc, etc... Quality of build is great, sound and video great, could always use a bigger drive but 30 is good already have 20 of my dvds on it. Only problems are marketplace wasnt ready yet. cant wait to see the updates. Video section needs market place and podcast section. also movies purchased on xbox360 should transfer over to the zune. and zune to 360. until then, you wont see me buy any movies on live. anyone considering buying a zune protect the screen www.sheildzone.com best!!! bad news for case companies. I put one of these on and never use a case the size of the zune right in my hands is all i need. no bulky case.. when transfering files from itunes (all the dvds rips I made) it converts and transfers that converted file to the zune..NOT duplicating files on hard drive as Itunes generally does. also when i tell the software to check a folder for content it does it everytime! unike itunes, you have to manually tell it to each time you add new content.. all those rumors of zune software crashing, I had no problems at all... on 3 computers.. you guys spreading that rumor need to upgrade your crappy PC's.. cant think of anything else. Fun Player love the way it organizes media on my laptop. oh and software isnt a ram hog as itunes is. GART.exe i think it was?? a program that runs causing system hang? running itunes takes up 40MB ram without content in the library!!! whats up with that?. 

$$;
Pros:. Wi-Fi, Great Video, impressive sound. 
Cons:. To much like the Ipod. 
Summary:. First off, notice who Rates the Zune high, and who Rates it low. Sadly there are jerks out there who decided that they dont like the Zune, and will give it a nice low score without even trying. I was one of them, until I decided to buy one for my brother for his birthday. A little more about me: I hate the IPOD. I was excited when I learned that Microsoft was working on an 'Ipod killer'. I was excited until I read more into it and realized that, thats all the Zune is going to be, competition for the Ipod.. I completely conformed to the Zune- My brother, his girlfriend and I spent his birthday with the Zune. Setting up the zune and getting everything installed was a piece of cake. The zune music software was a whole lot better then I thought. It was more visual appealing then Windows Media Players, and kick's Itune's butt in everything, except for Zune Marketplace, which was small compared to the Itunes online store.. We were able to sync about 3000 songs, a few hundred photos, and a few small videos with no problems at all. I did notice that low-bitrate music sounded worse on the Zune then on my brother's girlfriend's Ipod, but high-bitrate music excelled over the Ipod.. The user Interface was excellent, allowing customization, and smooth and easy navigating. The button layout was hard to use at first, but we got the hang of it quickly.. The downsides are basically the same as the the downsides of the Ipod. Limited accessories, the fact you have to use the Zune music software to sync.. I did not get to use the zune's wi-fi, but I plan to buy a zune for myself, and I'll test it out. As far as I am concerned, the wi-fi will seem limited, especially if you compare it archos 604 wi-fi, but it seems that there are many plans for the wi-fi that will be released in later firmware upgrades by Microsoft. I did a little of research about the possibility of zune viruses. (some apple-fan boys believe are inevitable of any Microsoft product) It seems that the zune's wifi is very secure.. To conclude- The zune is an excellent product, and a definite contender against the Ipod. On that not, be careful of those reviews of people who have not actually used the Zune, because odds are they are hardcore apple fans who can't have any competition for their precious Ipod.. 

$$;
Pros:. Another mainline MP3 Player. 
Cons:. Another mainline MP3 Player. 
Summary:. Where's the Web Browser? The PSP has one. Why not this device? Zune team, add it in the next firmware update if you haven't already planned to do so.. 

$$;
Pros:. very intuitive interface, great audio/video quality. 
Cons:. battery life, minimal accesseries included. 
Summary:. I have been shopping around for an mp3 player for a very long time now. I've never been a fan of the "touch sensitive" controls of other mainstream mp3 players, but I wanted the sheer capacity that they offered. The "wheel" on the Zune is not really a wheel at all. It is actually 4 buttons, cleverly disguised to fool us all. Upon seeing it in the store, I decided to test it out. It was very easy to play movies or music, or view pictures. I find myself instantly grasping the logical setup of all 3 of the aforementioned functions. Within 60 seconds of laying hands on the Zune, I already felt I knew exactly what I was doing. But I was a bit worried that maybe with a lot of content on it, the system would bog down and things may become hard to find. My cd collection is 300+ cds large, and it is still very easy and manageable to find a band, cd, or song. Audio quality is outstanding. I've had a problem with mp3 players in the past having too little volume, but in this case, limited volume is not a problem at all (in fact, I would caution users to be wary of the very high audio levels the Zune is capable of). The screen looks decent, but I find I'm not as picky about the video functionality as I am the audio, so perhaps I'm not the best person to critique that. But I have transcoded a few Seinfeld episodes to my Zune and have found watching them to be very enjoyable, minus a few areas of pixelated lighting. Admittedly, I have not used the picture interface since purchasing it, as I have minimal use for showing off pictures. But I can say with total confidence that no matter what you're using this for, if you need an intuitive control system with decent video and abhor any type of "touch" controls, consider the Microsoft Zune a viable option.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen for videos (better than my ipod video) with automatice landscape mode for videos for maximum viewing!. 
Cons:. Limited memory to 30GB only. 
Summary:. In my opinion, it's a good start for MS to enter the mobile media player market. It may not be the best product now but I'm sure we will expect more from them in the near future and could probably topple Ipod sooner than most people might think. Scratch free and matt finish look is great!. 

$$;
Pros:. Video screen size, radio tuner, bigger cd art display, made by microsoft. 
Cons:. shape, not enough capabilities for wi-fi, software marketplace needs some more features like video and podcast like downloads for free!. 
Summary:. I got my brown 30gig Zune and I love it. One of the reasons I bought it was because it is made by MS. The video playback is great and so is the sound quality. I love the screen size which is way bigger than the ipod. I have uploaded many videos from my library already and still got plenty of room left. The conversion by the Zune software is slow but I think it dependes on the file size. The Zune Marketplace needs some work. Things like a video store and podcast like downloads, I am sure this is in the works. I would like to see future Zune updtaes and enable the Zune to work as a hard drive, the possibility to support animated gif or even screen savers. Also hope to see the ability to utilize the wi-fi to surf the web and be able to see what other Zune users are litsening to.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome FM tuner, 3" screen, sound and video quality is wonderful.. 
Cons:. software is a bit cumbersome, can see it as a harddrive to carry other files from home to work. 
Summary:. I am a self professed "iPod hater", and when the video media player came out, I amost had to break down. I found out about the Zune and waited. And I'm glad I did. Side by side with my friends iPod, my Zune beats it out. Thanks again Microsoft..
