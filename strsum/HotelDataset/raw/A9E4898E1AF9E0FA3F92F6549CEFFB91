the dormy inn near muroran was the first stop on our road trip around hokkaido and was a convenient stopping off point after an afternoon in hell valley .
whilst the as others have observed , dormy inn is much more a 3* hotel rather than an `` inn '' , and the muroran branch is quite modern compared to some of the others .
typical with many other branches , they have a tower parking system ( jpy600 additional charge ) , free late evening noodles for anyone who turns up , and an onsite onsen/spa including an outdoor area .
the room was spotlessly clean , and the staff were helpful and had a reasonable command of english .
we even had a `` bonus '' during our stay - a minor earthquake .
amazingly the tv ( which was on a japanese channel as moving wallpaper ) had an audible alarm at the same time as we noticed the quake , and having been given a room on the top floor we could feel the building swaying .
all the encitement was over in a flash , but our stay at muroran will be extra memorable .
the town itself near the hotel is a little down at heel - there 's nothing wrong with it and its clean and well maintained , but there 's nothing we saw really to recommend .
muroran itself was a major steel making town , but many of the plants have been closed and the area is economically challenged .
however , we could n't fault any aspect of the service . . .

however , we could n't fault any aspect of the service and stay , and were pleased that we had chosen to stay here in the real japan as opposed to a more touristy hotel in jigokudai or toya.
