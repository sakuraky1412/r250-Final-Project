Friendly Staff Great Location !
Great hotel, great staff, great location not any problems what so ever .
Wonderful Hotel ,  Excellent Staff
The staff's professional, spirited attitude, , be they reservationist, valet, front desk, or housekeeper, , deserves 5 stars .
One of the friendliest desk concierge staffs I've encountered   .
The Staff helped make our stay a great experience .
Downsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms .
Staff was neither especially helpful or unhelpful .
DIsappointed in Front Desk Staff and Room Size
, pleasant staff, close to the Wharf, just a few blocks to the cable car turnaround, Pier 39 shopping,   ferry boat tours .
Every hotel should have this staff !
A staff member must have gone in right after we checked out .
