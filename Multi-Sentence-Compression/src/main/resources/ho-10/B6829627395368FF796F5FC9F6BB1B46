i booked some flights to gothenburg for a quick city break , only realising after i 'd booked that it was the weekend of the gothenburg half-marathon and hotels were pretty much sold out in the centre .
i booked this place through hostelworld , as it seemed to be easily accessible from the centre by tram and was also close to the docks area on the north side of the river which is being regenerated .
i stopped for a bite to eat near the hotel , so actually arrived there just after 12pm hoping to leave my bag and come back to check-in later .
i looked at the directions from the hotel website detailing the tram numbers that go past their stop and noticed it was n't actually that far so decided to walk as it was lovely weather .
it took me about 25 minutes to walk over the bridge and get to the hotel , good to know if i got stuck out in town late at night .
the room was quite compact and was a corner room which meant it had plenty of light but as you 're on the ground floor people walking past can see right inside .
there is free wi-fi throughout the hotel , and i had no problems with it and the speed was good .
there is a good size flat screen tv in the room , along with a mini fridge for storing drinks and a good size wadrobe and drawers .
overall i 'd have no problem staying here again , a good value choice and not too far from the centre .
i could only get an 'economy ' room which meant i did n't have an en-suite bathroom and had to walk down the corridor to use the showers .
