not much to dislike about this phone .
i just works for me .
in addition to calls , i use for email and texting and very little for surfing .
will keep this phone until verizon offers the iphone and then i will upgrade updated .
on jul 11 , 2010 .
over all a very well designed phone .
i is due for an upgrade , and is going to hold out for the latest bb release , but after reading many good articles about this phone , i decided to pull the trigger .
i am glad that i did , as this is by far the best bb i have owned .
no real problems or dislikes .
no trackball problems at all .
it looks like bb got that fixed for sure since this is my 3rd bb with trackball technology and i have noticed that this is by far the best working trackball yet i would buy this phone again for myself and highly recommend it to family members , co workers and friends .
the set up and use is so easy .
i got my phone just a couple of days before leaving for a trip to eastern europe and then egypt .
i had no problems whatsoever getting my emails , phone calls , connecting to the web -LRB- uploading photos at the great pyramids to my facebook page -RRB- .
once in a while i might be in a remote location and it would not connect right away , but as soon as it did , it would upload my emails , pics , etc .
i love this phone .
the clarity from one side of the world to the other -LRB- california -RRB- is amazing .
this is the first electronic device of 40 years of being computer savvy , that far exceeded by expectations .
i like the phones resolution i think that it is way better than the storm i tried that out and it is to sensitive .
i am really please with the tour it is by far the best in blackberry .
i love it .
the key pad is easy to use , the screen is just right , it looks sexy , and everyone tries to steal it from me .
trust me this phone is great , and i am not even talking about the papers i 've edited on it .
just get it .
its worth buying without the contract yes .
pay 400 500 ~ whatever it takes .
great phone , organizer , email utility , etc .
i is surprised most by the quality of the music player i had an ipod touch , and is waiting for the iphone to come to verizon , but i heard this is good and got it .
i now feel that i no longer need the ipod , because of the music player on this the external speaker is surprisingly loud if you want to listen without headphones for me , the fact that i can type someone 's name on the keyboard , and in one click have the option to text message , call , picture/video message , write on their facebook wall , send them a facebook message , or email them is amazing comparing with my use of the ipod touch and its applications -LRB- which are identical to the iphone 's -RRB- that is one area where blackberry falls short the quality of the applications is poor .
the facebook application itself -LRB- other than the contact syncing -RRB- is poor compared to the iphone .
also , the applications also seem much more expensive for organization and business use its great .
the ability to access word , excel , and powerpoint files is fantastic .
calendar contact utilities are easy to use and extremely useful bottom line great multi use device as far as practical usage it beats the iphone .
in terms of quality of applications it is not quite as good .
great for people wanting to stay organized at work , but still great for people who want it for personal use .
glad to be done with palm and be back with blackberry .
if u think u have fat or huge hands go to the store and hold one .
this is not my first smartphone , i just love this phone , it can do everything i want it to do and more .
i do not really like touch screen phones -LRB- too easy to break and freeze up -RRB- i like the tactile buttons on a phone and i believe that this is the best , most powerful phone on the market today better than the i phone yep i said it .
bottom line is that i love this phone , not that i travel that much , but knowing that i could and take it with me is a big plus .
i would recomend this phone to anyone who loves smart phones without a touch screen interface .
this powerfull gem is a multitasker 's dream .
i had the env touch and lovved it .
but there were issues with google on mobile email and unable to use my gmail .
it had been close two weeks and still not resolved .
i had 4 days left to make a decision and i decided to go with a blackberry .
before going into the store i had made up my mind on the curve .
this is my first blackberry and when i saw the tour i immediatley changed my mind .
i have not had any problems using it and figuring it out .
the more i find out and learn the more i love it and wonder why it took me so long to get a blackberry .
i absolutely love this device .
my only complaint is no wifi and the battery life is short .
i can go a full day and if not used a lot can get a day and a half .
the envtouch is short on battery life as well .
but i still like it and it does charge up quickly .
i highly recommend this blackberry .
you can not go wrong .
i have two brothers and one of them is also with verizon .
he said he would never use a blackberry but since i have told him how great this one is , he has checked it out and plans to upgrade updated .
on sep 15 , 2009 .
overall i think blackberry keeps getting better .
i have previously had the blackberry 8330 through sprint and although it is a great phone , each blackberry introduced seems to have just a little bit more than the last .
i now have verizon and love the availability of visual voicemail .
i can not think of a better way of spending a mere $ 2 .
99 a month .
it seems that setting up profiles has given even more choices than that of the curve , allowing the user to choose more sounds and vibrations for even more activities within mail , phone and messaging .
i do n't travel often , but when i do , communication wo not be a problem with the addition of global capabilities .
i have a slight electronic fetish , having tried almost every new high end phone on the market and the blackberry tour is by far my favorite .
will be heard to top .
what a smartphone with a keyboard hands down the phone for you .
my moms first tour had the notoriously bad trackball issue .
it would take some effort to scroll right .
after it is replaced hers the 2nd unit has worked perfectly so far i am very happy with my new phone updated .
on sep 16 , 2009 .
had it over a week and have no complaints .
2 minor tweaks changing horizontal sensitivity from 70 to 80 .
works perfect now .
changed headset volume to high treble and no volume issues .
many users complain about battery life or reception .
i have noticied better reception than my curve and battery life is slightly less but who does not charge their phone daily anyway .
this is the best bb verizon has hands down .
let me preface my comments by saying this is my first smart phone purchase .
i did an awful lot of research online , and did some hands on time with both an iphone and the blackberry tour .
the iphone is a sleek device , and it is not so much a matter of disliking that phone , as it is what i like about the tour .
i is also not inclined to go to at @t for my wireless service , so that is another strike against the iphone -LRB- again , for me -RRB- the qwerty keyboard is nice on this phone .
i have no problems composing texts or emails rather quickly and accurately .
tapping on the glass surface of an iphone is not the same -LRB- for me -RRB- .
this device is a messaging and e mail dynamo .
easy to use and manage the trackball makes navigation all around your tour quick .
again , this is the first smartphone i have purchased , and i is up and running rather comfortably on this phone almost immediately call quality is solid .
i is an alltel customer and is transitioning to verizon anyway due to the merger of those two , but verizon service and coverage has also been solid for me .
cnet takes a shot at this phone for not having wi fi built into it .
honestly , the speed on this phone has been absolutely a non issue .
i can get on anywhere , and being in a wi fi hotspot has therefore been a moot point .
i have a home wireless network like many of you , and i use my laptop at home for that not my blackberry .
i do n't feel as if i am missing out on something because my blackberry does not connect in a wi fi area .
the phone connects anywhere i want it to if you want nothing but apps and more apps , then the tour might not be your first choice .
but the apps i have downloaded -LRB- about 10 thus far -RRB- were easy and smooth through blackberry app world .
the newest version of app world is just released , and it has better streamlined the app browsing process as well overall , just a solid device .
the higher rating from cnet is deserved based on my experience with it .
i loved my 8830 and am even more impressed with the tour i wanted to add that many complain about battery life but i have had no issues with this myself .
i also really like the white backlighting at night .
my 8830 had blue backlighting on the keys and this made it difficult so see at night i would highly recommend this product to business users .
you will not be disappointed .
if you are not already a black berry user now is the time to make the switch .
i love it .
i have a storm also .
yes people either love the storm or they hate it .
i love mine and never thought i would say this but i love the tour just about as much .
i use storm for personal use and tour for business use .
when got the storm the day they came out i gave my wife my curve .
she has always been unimpressed with phones and says a phone is a phone .
the day i brought the tour home i made a mistake and showed it to her .
this it the first time she saw and tried out a phone that she said it reminded her of the verizon commercial where the guy says in his mind do not put that down or i 'll take it so the next day i went and got her one .
she abosolutely loves it and is the first smartphone or for that matter any phone she has ever used to it 's potential .
i never thought i would use anything except a touch after having the storm but i find myself carrying around the tour more than the storm .
fits the hand well , looks great and works very well .
i would definitely recommend the tour and so would my wife .
a world phone tht looks , functions and basically does what you need .
5 out of 5 best regards , .

i is a little scepticle about switching from a normal phone to a blackberry .
it has only been two days and i feel like i could never go back .
the tour seriously will replace my laptop .
it 's the best blackberry from verizon i 've had yet .
oh boy i am going to buy this on sunday and i am going to be the best person in the universe because it will make me that way .
i will then proceed to bonk iphone people in the face with my ultrabitchin blackberry on a network that functions with a company that uses lube when reaming you with a smile instead of the epically incompetent at t .
i look forward to being the best person in the universe .
great all around phone from watching movies , playing games , running business applications , and being reliable .
the battery life is poor , extremely poor as i use to close all programmes which is running on the phone but still it doesnt last for long .
and the other issue is that phone keeps on restarting on its own very frequently , i just dont get it as to why because iv got the new software as well .
i would highly recommend this phone to anybody looking for a business/corporate mobile office device .
i would also recommend to anybody on a personal level who is looking to better organize their life .
the calendar function is easy to use and integrates with outlook if you are a windows user i also like the camera that comes with it .
it is a 3 .
2 megapixel and it takes great photos .
i 've used it at several concerts and the flash feature is a plus the video capability of the camera is an added bonus ibseric .

after three bolds -LRB- two returned for warranty repair , the third abused by me -RRB- , i 'd finally had enough of the too frequent dropped calls , s l o w downloads , and apps that never seemed to work properly .
my beef is more with at t than the bold itself , so i switched to verizon wireless and settled on its slightly sleeker half brother , the tour .
after exhaustive research , i 've accepted the fact that there is no perfect smartphone , so my expectations were in line with the bold 's performance , only hoping for a better network .
i 'm shocked to say how much more i like this phone than i thought i would .
in all likelihood , verizon wireless ' network is what makes it so great , but after nearly a month of ownership , and not one single freeze by the o/s -LRB- and i think i 've actually turned it off only once in that entire time -RRB- tells me that the handset itself is also much better than the bold .
i love having a clear usable camera ; the bold 's is useless -LRB- even my old palm treo and helio ocean 's cameras had more functionality than the bold 's camera -RRB- .
calls no longer drop unless , ironically , i 'm talking to someone on the at t network .
the lack of wifi is a completely overrated complaint .
all three of my bolds ' browsers , while using wifi , were slower than my tour .
if web browsing is a big part of your smartphone use , skip blackberries altogether ; they do not have 1/10th of the usefulness of an iphone while verizon wireless is no corporate saint itself , not supporting many apps that i presume use too much data in their eyes , they provide a quality network that is reliable .
not having the daily frustrations of using at t 's overwhelmed network -LRB- thanks to the iphone -RRB- , has made my relationship with my smartphone a much better marriage .
ok first , this is to people who gave this amazing device bad reviews .
the first batch of tours had several devices with problems , such as loose battery door , and faulty trackball .
this has been fixed on devices with a manufacture date of august or later .
mine is manufacutred july 17th , and ive had no problems though , some of the original release tour 's are fine as well now on to my short review .
i love this blackberry .
it is my first , and i will never buy a non blackberry device again .
the web browsing is very fast , they keyboard took me 2 days to get used to , it seemed cramped at first .
i came from a big keyboard though -LRB- lg voyager -RRB- .
after my first 2 days , im just as fast at typing .
the speakerphone , or when playing music is very loud and clear .
voice quality on my part and from the other side is great .
batttery life is sub par until about 5 days of use , its much beter now .
trackball works terrific on my particular device , a new tour will be out shortyly -LRB- blackberry essex -RRB- and tour owners can make a simple swap that yes , will void warrenty , but you will be able to use the trackpad from the essex on your tour in short everything about this device is great .
i would reccomend it to anyone .
this is my third blackberry and it is by far the best .
similar in style to the curve and bold , almost a hybrid .
this phone is easy to use and has all the necessary smart phone features .
i am kind of bummed that it does not have wifi , but i blame that on verizon .
the keyboard is much more responsive and tighter than the curve .
the battery life kind of sucks , and the software is kind of laggy .
but that will probably be fixed with the new os update .
the phone is fast and has a great feel in the hand -LRB- does n't feel cheap -RRB- .
the keyboard takes some getting used to compared to the bold -LRB- at t -RRB- which is a bit larger .
the curve , which to me is a great phone , looks cheap compared to the tour .
overall i like the new look , faster processor and no memory leaks -LRB- like the storm -RRB- is hoping something groundbreaking from the storm ii but wifi and the same screen press concept is not worth sitting around waiting for .
the tour does what the curve did just faster , better keyboard , better looking , and nicer screen some complain that they 've received defective trackballs on the tour .
my advice , do n't buy one online and end up having to ship it back 3 4 times .
i know you can get instant rebates online , but i like to personally inspect it at the store and walk away satisfied , versus getting one in the mail only to find out it does not work right so far i love the tour .
thumbs up .
current handset bb tour .
current carrier verizon .
previous handsets used palm 600 , 700 , 755p , bb 7100i -LRB- all sprint or nextel -RRB- , bb curve -LRB- verizon -RRB- , bb bold 9000 -LRB- at t -RRB- previous carriers used t mobile , nextel -LRB- prior to sprint -RRB- , sprint , at t blackberry what a brand name editorial .
i 'll give it to apple .
but all that glitters is not always preceded by an i blackberry has redeemed itself nicely with the tour .
i do say redeemed because of the ridiculous attempts to throw handsets out to keep up with demand without qualifying their products first .
the bold size is absolutely too big and bulky and storm 's lame haptics and aggravatingly lack of screen response for most users , put planned obsolescence at the top of the board room meeting rather than quality out of the box int ' l charging adapters , an actual leather case that i really use , and you may , too handset .
better size than bold .
most rugged bb to date .
solid , rubber case is great , but bling style platinum bezel is a waste just get over your self and make the whole thing rubberized .
the only drawback that is major are the keyboard buttons .
if you look at the photos of the thing , do a close up of the keyboard .
you 'll notice a horseshoe shaped piece at the bottom of the face with no apparent use other than a convenient place to badge the carrier .
all of this room could have been utilized for keyboard space .
what a waste .
can not have everything life would be boring use .
no wifi bummer .
call quality is great and all the features you 'd expect from bb are included with some new extras -LRB- read $ -RRB- .
visual voicemail , etc for a smartphone , apple is popular think michael jackson .
pop , candy , bubble gum but not serious and most people that used to show them off now tire of it taking so much of their time but bb tour think u2 .
always striving to do better , always relevant , always innovating and gets better with time .
bb does not seek bad publicity with thinking that any publicity is good .
they just work .
and well keep it up bb .
tour is an achievement to be proud of .
now keep it up a solid leader .

this phone is so much better than the storm .
crackberry .
com has tips on how to free up memory if your tour is lagging .
great keyboard .
best bb i 've ever owned .
this is my first smartphone , and , as it 's nickname indicates , i am addicted to my crackberry .
this phone looks fantastic .
i originally was not sure how i would like the keyboard , seeing as i 've used other peoples ' curve and could n't adjust , but this keyboard feels really good .
i find it easy to type and the phone feels absolutely great in the hand call quality is the best i 've had on any phone , the display is great .
should my opinion change on this phone , i will update this review .
but i do not see that happening .
my hat 's off to verizon for carrying this phone and blackberry for designing and building it .
great phone and i 'd recommend to anyone .
being a crackberry addict is tough but the tour makes it all worth it .
first of all i must say that i am sick and tired of fools who do n't own products , yet opinions and offer reviews .
your lack of ownership and experience with the product is grossly apparent .
please stop wasting our time .
o , sorry this is a review of the verizon blackberry tour not a blasting of the foolish if you want a smartphone this is the best of what you can get on the verizon network .
the tour is a fine culmination of the blackberrys that preceded it .
having owned and used the pearl -LRB- 8130 -RRB- , the 8830 , 8703e and 3 weeks with a storm i can tell you this handset is fast , reliable , and easy to use some of the other reviews complained about the battery life of this phone .
during the first few days that i owned this phone i thought they were right , but now that i am not playing with the phone every minute of the day the battery life is as good or better than my other blackberrys another complaint that i have read about is that the resolution of the screen is too high and that it makes the fonts on the browser too tiny .
this is accurate ; the fonts are tiny but just click the pearl and it gets bigger .
the high resolution is a far greater asset for every other function of this phone to be worried about enlargeable fonts being too small this phone does not have wifi .
give me a break .
its a phone .
if you need to use the internet so much go get a netbook .
there is no debate that the verizon network is the best of all the wireless options out there .
this is after all a phone -LRB- a phone with some fantastic abilities -RRB- but it works primarily off of a cellular network not wifi so this should not be an issue when considering if this blackberry is for you if you are a blackberry power user this is the one .
i tried the storm for 3 weeks yes it has a nice screen and it does same thing as the tour but it is slow i is mad at it all the time .
the click screen on the storm is the worst idea ever , if the people at rim had used a touch screen like that of the ipod itouch and given the storm the 256mb of memory it would have been a contender in closing this is great blackberry .
it works well , it 's fast , it 's slick , it looks better in person than it does on line .
it comes with a nice case , it 's the right size , it feels good in your hand , the keyboard is very good -LRB- it takes a few days to get used to -RRB- , the battery life is very good , the battery doors does not wiggle , the micro usb location is just fine , the screen is sweet , the track ball works fine after it is broken in after a few days , it 's not heavy , it 's just the right weight .
if you want great a blackberry and you want verizon this is it .
if you have never had a blackberry , have be on verizon , do not mind a super slow and heavy phone , and value style above function and preformance give a storm a try .
as above , i recommend it for all users .
however , i bought it for corporate use and feel this is the best use of the features on the phone as i am on the go frequently out of the office .
this is my first blackberry , but thought it is easy to use after the first day of use and reviewing the manual .
i love my tour just need to get a car charger but easily fixable who needs wii fii anymore you have to get an unlimited data plan anyways so im pretty much ok without it call quality and speaker phone both really clear and loud i like my tour better then my friends bold , the bold is just bigger bigger is not always better , just wish the tour had better battery life and yeah it would be amazing i would recomend this to anyone looking for a smart for that like functional and organized so glad i got it .
i 've had the phone for about 2 weeks now and for the most part it 's been great .
email and messaging is very fast , and a lot of the apps are nicely integrated into the phone .
one example is itookthisonmyphone , an app which automatically uploads pictures taken to an online folder .
when viewing the images , an added upload to itook is placed right in the menu .
i really like being able to run multiple apps , though the toll on the battery becomes noticeable after 3 or 4 simultaneous .
cool perks like giving each alert a custom led color and other such features are nice but often not worth the $ 5 10 in the app store e .
, $ 5 for an app called flashlight that makes makes your led light up and work as a flashlight cool , but $ 5 for that .
personally , i am not that interested in it as an mp3 player , i usually have pandora running the background for music .
the sound is good and the media player and filing system seems fine but it 's honestly not what i use it for .
there is a 160 world limit on sms messages but like most things , there is a pay for app that threads longer messages together .
everything is very customizable .
battery usually gets me through the day without charging without heavy pandora use .
overall , i like the keyboard a lot i 'm personally not a fan of touch screens and find it easy to use , a bit easier than my gf 's 8900 i 've only had to restart thus far for installing apps and it really does take a while , often more than 5 minutes .
i do not find it that bothersome but it is something to be aware of .
i 've not had to reset it because of a problem so far .
everyone beats it to death but wi fi is sorely missing .
as a world phone , being able to use hotspots around the world without roaming would have been amazing , in addition to being able to use your local spots .
fortunately , this seems to be the last non wifi smartphone for verizon sound quality is good and quite loud , i usually keep it at half volume when talking .
reception is good but of course that depends on your coverage so i can not review that overally , i 've enjoyed the phone , largely for messaging , facebook , emailing and web browsing .
if you 're looking for a phone/mp3 player , i can not really say much except that the media player seems sufficient , with the normal features -LRB- playlists , shuffle , etc -RRB- but not with anything flashy .
it 's great for what i use it for and i plan to use it while the new lte blackberries are in production updated .
on aug 8 , 2009 .
thank you so much for your review of the 9630 .
i have been reviewing blackberries and is told this one has great features and now you have confirmed .
thank you so much for featuring this smart phone benigna marko .
updated .
on sep 1 , 2009 .
overall , i love this phone .
i got it on the day it came out , and is a little skeptical at first because of coming from the storm and having a couple issues with that phone .
but i is definitely wrong about that one .
the call quality is great and i usually have trouble hearing people on the phone , do n't ask me why , and this phone i can hear everyone clearly and with ease .
the applications such as facebook and myspace are great .
the e mail setup is fast and easy .
the phone is very customizable to what you want with it and that is a huge plus for me .
i am very picky about my phones and usually get a new phone every 6 7 months , but this one i could see having longer than that .
the keyboard is sometimes weird to type on but this is my first blackberry with an actual keyboard and i am getting used to it .
overall the keyboard is great and i love texting and e mailing on it .
and the ringer volume is so loud and i love it .
i have a big backyard and i can hear my phone ringing from inside the house when i 'm almost at the end of our fence .
overall i love this phone .
it 's a great phone and in my opinion has a better keyboard than the curve and is a lot easier to use .
the call quality which lets face it is the most important feature on a phone is amazing and so is the speakerphone .
if anyone is having second thoughts about getting this phone do n't you wo not regret it .
aside from the battery life -LRB- roughly 24 hours/charge with moderate to heavy use -RRB- i really have nothing bad to say about this phone .
even the battery issue could be rectified by purchasing an extended life battery it 's my first foray into the realm of blackberry , and it 's everything i 'd thought it would be with one minor exception .
it would be nice to have some sort of .
flv support , however that 's only a minor disappointment .
i 'll just have to keep looking forward to the release of the skyfire browser for blackberry to address that issue all in all , it 's a quality product that either meets or exceeds my expectations for a smartphone , and is well worth the money .
i have had the tour for a little of two weeks .
this is my 4th blackberry and is my favorite by far .
i have had the 8830 world , curve , storm and now the tour camera has the same mp as the storm but the quality is much better screen .
the resolution wicked , very crisp and bright menus .
they are much more user friendly .
reminds me of the storm .
s menus size .
sits between the curve and the bold .
very comfortable in the hand .
speed .
almost as fast as the bold and much faster then the other blackberrys on verizon wireless home screen dialing .
this is by far my favorite feature .
you just starting typing the name or the number of the person that you want to call and the name pops up and you click to dial .
no need to go to a phone app within the tour -LRB- or any keypad blackberry for that matter -RRB- case profile switching .
no need to go to a meeting and remember to switch your blackberry to vibrate .
all you have to do is customize your profile to silent when in case and to vibrate .
genius .
verizen customer service .
when ever i have had an issue or question they have an answer .
i have also been transferred directly to blackberry tech support when i had an issue with the desktop software .
verizon also called me back to make sure that the issues is solved .
big fan of customer service battery .
is a little on the weak side .
lasts about of the day .
this should improve with a device software update battery cover .
is a little loose but not as bad as many are saying start up time .
because data security is a hot button for rim .
i have been told that the long start time is because of security processes with the files on the device .
when you do a battery pull or a soft reset it takes about 5 minutes for the phone to be up and running again with that said , this is a great phone .
i still have a couple issues with 3rd party apps like facebook -LRB- calendar sync issue -RRB- and ubertwitter -LRB- not installing properly -RRB- but updates to the apps should solve the problems one way of extending the battery life is to turn off your connections when you know you are not going to have signal syncs great with pcs and comes with desktop software 5 .
0 which increases the speed of the sync process .
apple users not to fret , rim is going to be releasing an apple version of their desktop software in the 3rd quarter of the year .
both the tour and bold has a long cycling to start up .
can not just put in the batter and talk until about a two minutes later .
the tour screen is a bit more higher definition but virtually unnoticeable as an important improvement .
however the tour sports a 3 .
2 megapixel camera over the bold 2 .
0 for improved picture quality but rim blackberry did n't increase the shutter speeds both phones gives you fast 3g services and international use in over 185 countries .
i 've use my phones in both europe and latin american without any problems in connecting calls or texting or receiving emails .
just make sure you call your provider before disembarking outside the u .
so you phone will work qwerty keys works well on both phones even with fat fingers the keys feel great .
applications download with ease and works great .
just wish applications were cheaper to purchase .
however , the applications that are given with phone are great like documents to go if your use to web browsing on a bb then you 're satisfied enough .
if you 're use to web browsing on an iphone then you 'll scream for something better if you 're undecided over the tour vs bold then it may just boil down to which vendor or service carrier has the most coverage or better customer service for your area .
you wo not be displease with either phone as i use both but will soon drop my bold for the tour only because i prefer sprint over at t and verizon .
but wished the tour had wifi .
unfortunately the bb bold is only with at t but at least with the bb tour you have a choice of either sprint or verizon .
although i 've been stuck with at t for having the edge on carrying great phones -LRB- bb bold iphone -RRB- you can now buy the bb tour for only $ 199 at either sprint -LRB- online -RRB- or verizon -LRB- in stores -RRB- .
in my area verizon has the best service for non drop calls but sprint has the best lowest priced service plans .
so choose your poison .
great phone , very functional and practical for business and connectivity while remaining fun and entertaining .
i very much enjoy this product and it is beginning to make my laptop obsolete .
the apps and customization make it much more than just a business phone .
and the social networking apps along with texting , email support , and bbm make this a very good phone for people of any age or social group .
highly recommend .
great phone , leaps and bounds above any other phone i 've owned .
it 's light on the applications but heavy on the functions it has .
facebook contact attachment is super cool cause i like having photos on my contacts battery lasts about 2 days with normal use wifi would be nice , but i am extremely satisfied with this phone .
upgraded interface has a more polished feel .
sound quality is improved over the previous version .
keyboard has a better tactile feel making typing faster .
this device is an upgrade from the palm treo 700wx for me .
big difference in browser speed .
switches from one application to another very quickly almost no hesitation .
image clearity is outstanding .
of course bb has always been better with synching emails better then palm .
i didnt like that i had to pay for an app to work on spreadsheets and word doc 's -LRB- doc to go -RRB- .
full price of app is $ 69 .
95 wow .
when i downloaded the app it is $ 30 .
at least it is easier to use on a handheld then the office suite that comes on windows mobile .
i wish this device came with wi fi , verizon finly started to allow wi fi on there devices and the one i felt is the best didnt have it -LRB- sucks -RRB- .
the best bb i have owned .
does everything i need for work .
dude this phione totally rocks .
www .
total privacy .
net .
its a wonderful device and i highly reccomend it .
updated .
on dec 24 , 2009 .
i have only had the blackberry tour for a week , but i must say i am very impressed with it .
let me start of by saying that i use this phone for personal use and not business .
i had the blackberry curve before and found myself very board with it .
i did n't like the video quality , the web quality , or the graphics .
i also felt that it is lacking in the applications department .
i is seriously considering switching to at t so i could get the iphone , but really did n't want to because verizon has the best coverage out there now that i have the tour i no longer need to switch to the iphone .
the tour has excellent video quality , much better that the curve had .
the graphics are great , and it has plenty of free applications to choose from using the blackberry world download .
the web browser also looks better than the curve ; it looks more like a desktop computer browser now instead of a mobile one .
it does not have a touch screen like the iphone , but i find that if you like to text and email a lot , touch screens can be a huge hassle the only con about this phone so far is the battery life , but if you think about it , the blackberry is like a small computer and i know with my laptop if it 's not plugged up while i 'm using it , the battery is dead in 1 .
5 hrs so what can you expect i highly recommend this phone .
if you have never had a blackberry before , it may take some time getting used , but it 's totally worth it .
if you are coming from the pearl -LRB- as i was -RRB- you will love this phone .
easy transition except for the keyboard .
still an easier transition than when i got the pearl as my first bb then again i have only had it two days so ask me in a month if i still love it .
reviews of this phone in particular seem similar to our current political climate polarized and one extreme or the other .
in this case 4 5 star , ' i love it or 1 2 phone sucks reviews .
another general observation on cell phone reviews in general .
many , many phones seem to draw negative comments about battery life .
seems that people want their phones to do absolutely everything yet maintain battery power like the phone has only one function after a day of talking , messaging , and doing other miscellaneous functions , my phone usually has at least 3/4 charge .
i do not know what the big deal is that some folks think charging more than every 3 days is a huge problem can it be that our expectations are becoming unrealistic .
i am a mac user , and use the missing sync .
i love that the tour can be synced using bluetooth , and you only need to use the cable the first time .
blackberry and mac have some issues , but there are some good third party apps out there to address most of them i upgraded from a curve , and though there are not drastic differences in the phones interfaces , i find the tour to be the superior phone .
it has more options , a better screen , and at least for me , better call quality so when the verdict is in , i end up being in the i love this phone camp .
came from the curve 8330 , which i really liked .
overall , the tour is awesome .
love the apps/features , keyboard , phone quality .
was not sure i 'd like the keyboard compared to the curve , but i actually like it better my biggest complaint of the tour is horrible battery life .
i can not make it through the day on a single charge .
i did not have this problem with the curve .
my first blackberry is the curve on t mobile and i hated it so much that after using it for literally 5 minutes i put it back in the box .
then i had one of the first storms that is so bad it should not have left alpha testing .
now i figured i would give rim one last try , and boy , have they redeemed themselves atleast with me anyway .
i now know why they call it a crackberry .
it is missing that thing that the iphone has -LRB- i had that too , 2g , good phone just wish it had everything a blackberry has -RRB- .
if someone can make a phone that has the iphone 's touch screen , ease of use , and fluid os with blackberry 's productivity , mms .
, and multitasking , then that would be like the perfect phone .
in short this is my first blackberry and i love it .
heading back to school i is shopping around for something to consolidate my cell phone and pda .
i want to be organized but not having to lug around so many devices .
my 2 year contract with verizon had expired a few months back so i is free to shop around .
at first i is leaning toward the at t iphone , but after owning an ipod touch for awhile i find that typing on the iphone is not for me .
i also have been with at t before and had bad experience with reception .
the area that i am in right now have excellent verizon coverage .
also areas where i visit my family and friends have excellent verizon coverage .
verizon has a reputation for charging everything but i think that is why they have the funds to expand their network and coverage .
i looked at other phones and came across the rim blackberry 9630 tour .
the phone had high user ratings and overall excellent reviews .
i never owned a blackberry before but know a lot of people who have and they all love theirs .
after reading the good reviews and my good experience with verizon service i decided to give the blackberry tour a try .
i paid $ 249 up front for the phone , but after a mail in rebate it will be $ 150 .
driving home i used the navigator service that verizon let you try free for a month .
i really like this program and will probably keep it .
setting up email is very easy i set one up for my hotmail and gmail account .
i is impress on how fast mail get sent and arrive .
the contact book is very nice , you can pull the contacts information from online sites like facebook and myspace if they have one .
the voice command feature works great , you do not need to train a contacts name in advance .
the desktop manager like i stated is very buggy , but when it work i am able to transfer mp3 and pictures from my desktop onto the tour .
i can use the mp3 for ringtones and the pictures as wallpapers in conclusion this my first blackberry and it wont be my last .
this thing does everything that i need it to do .
i can make calls , keep my contacts at hand , read email , and keep organize for school .
not having the wifi feature is not a big deal .
it would be nice to have wifi but otherwise i can live without it .
if you are eligible for an upgrade and want to be organize get this phone .
this is a huge step up from the previous phone i had -LRB- palm centro -RRB- .
the os on the palm is horrible in comparrison to the blackberry 4 .
7 os .
its not really user friendly and is still taking some getting used to .
for example , setting up e mail on the phone .
when i first bought the phone , it prompted me to set up email via the email wizard , but since my phone wasnt even activated thought my service i declined .
it is almost impossible to figure out how to set it up again .
other than that this phone is one of a kind .
i can see why so many people love blackberries .
first i have had this phone for a week so i gave it time to write a legit review .
i passed on getting a storm when it is first released because of the touchscreen and the bad reviews the phone received .
verizon has a bad selection of phones but great service .
so after a looong wait , ive finally found the bberry for me .
great screen , great reception , and a nice looking phone .
i have an apple touch and loved the app store .
never wanted an iphone bcuz of the touchscreen and the phone being on at t .
the variety of apps you can get from the blackberry app store makes the phone even better .
i have a gps program , sports scores , weather etc .
all in the palm of my hands and internet .
i can go on and on about the great third party apps , but the most important thing is the phone call quality .
on verizon there is no need for wi fi .
reception is great and ive never had a dropped call yet .
the internet runs smooth and radio programs like pandora run without interruption .
blackberry email is great , i have it linked to my yahoo account and also have one bbery account .
blackberry messenger runs smooth and is good because i have many friend with bberries .
yahoo messenger runs without a problem .
i receive messages without a problem .
i text alot and the qwerty keyboard is better than any touchscreen .
one of my complaints is the keyboard being slightly cramped .
i guess they did this to slim down the phone .
i find myself pushing two buttons at once and my fingers are pretty normal sized .
the other minor complaint is the battery door slides around on the back of the phone .
it moves very slightly but its annoying when you pay this much for a phone .
i have my phone covered with a protective cover now , so i dont feel the door moving anymore .
if you make use of all the great third party apps you can turn this phone into a great phone .
i dont understand why some people buy a blackberry but never use email and never download other applications .
they prevent themselves from discovering about 90 % of what a bberry can do .
great phone , great quality , and great service .
this phone is a keeper for verizon customers that refuse to go the iphone or touchscreen route .
i live in nyc , where verizon wireless is the only network with decent coverage and reliability .
finally there is a blackberry available on vzw with true multimedia capabilities and a full keyboard .
i got a tour to replace my pearl , whose keyboard is beginning to drive me nuts anyway this is one sweet little phone .
in addition to blackberry 's usual email and phone strengths , it has a full set of multimedia capabilities .
it can play youtube videos and stream pandora internet radio without a hitch .
the camera takes crisp pictures -LRB- despite bonnie cha 's review -RRB- and has a strong flash , though the long shutter lag is a bit of a drag .
the sharp , bright display is a delight .
the keyboard is a joy to use ; no touch screens for me .
the biggest downside to the tour is short battery life .
daily recharging is a must ; recharging more than once a day is necessary if you use it heavily , such as for internet radio or video streaming .
another annoyance is vzw 's continued insistence on crippling third party gps applications , such as google maps and zagat to go , in order to drive people to the $ 10/month vz navigator service .
i 'm sorry , i will never sign up for vz navigator , on principle .
give it up , vzw , and compete on product features instead .
the other vzw related peeve i have is the lack of wifi compared to similar devices on other networks , so that people are forced to use air minutes on vzw instead of wifi networks run by other carriers a smaller peeve that will affect fewer users rhapsody to go is supposed to work on this device .
it does not ; the pc software will not recognize the phone for authorization .
i have spent about 3 hours on the phone with both vzw and realnetworks tech support and have yet to solve this issue but overall , this is a great phone .
blackberry users need no longer have iphone envy .
i have switched between verizon blackberries and iphones 3 times now .
i am on my third blackberry with the first two being the 8830 and the 8330 .
i switch , generally , because i easily bore with a phone after a while .
i am currently a law student , and right now a legal intern and love the speeding email and messaging capabilities of the blackberry with all of that useless info being said , i absolutely love this phone .
when i felt the loose battery covery i hardly cared after playing around with the os for a day .
it is very responsive and does not lag nearly as much as the older models .
i have not had to reset the phone once and i have had it since monday -LRB- today is thursday -RRB- my biggest gripe is the fact that rim decided to place the microphone on the bottom of the speaker which definitely causes a slight muffle to my voice going out .
luckily the incomming sound is so good , i decided to not care that other people probably can not hear me as well as i can hear them so far so good with this one .
test post .
come on blackberry we all know you guys know what the public wants and you can put a phone together we all would .
love .
radio/tv with good picture .
one touch features that are consistant and dont need to be re adjusted ect .
not complaining .
companies never get the idea of trying out products , manuals and websites with consumers .
if their employees are happy , they assume everyone can use it .
technical masterpieces are marvels , but usability creates frustrations with users who are the ones who tell other purchasers whether they like the phone or not nonetheless , after one gets through the frustrations , cognitive dissonance takes place and the features and capabilities of the phone make one forget the flaws and difficulties and frustrations of tring to use the phone .
i would recommend this phone for anyone that has a business need .
bes services run great and the phone is very nice with a great display i 'm disappointed by the lack of language support , especially russian inputs the selection of apps as well as those native to the phone is good .
the camera is a huge plus for this phone .
i 'm not sure why they even offer a model without .
after going through 3 pearls -LRB- 8130 -RRB- i decided it is time to move on .
the tour is definitely a step up .
the product is sleek and looks like the coveted bb bold but 2 notches better .
i do not notice that much of a difference from the small form factor of my pearl to this device the 4 .
7 os is great .
the higher resolution camera with auto focus is good but still too slow on loading .
the browser is the best -LRB- of bb 's -RRB- i 've seen yet .
-LRB- hush you iphone users , i know safari is # 1 -RRB- battery life and the os freezes are the downside for me .
2 hours of talk time will truly deplete your battery if it is below 80 % .
if your battery is below 30 % , then your battery will deplete quickly no matter what preventive steps you take great phone .
rim needs to work out some of the os kinks and release an update asap .
kudos to verizon for unlocking the gps for other apps and putting out a quad band gsm phone .
whew .
nice having all features .
i would say this is the best cdma blackberry on the market .
i really would recommend it to any verizon user .
some applications lag , my guess is to poor code , because others work well .
could be a much better with a new firmware update .
hoping for one soon , to fix several issues this phone has .
if i were you i 'd keep my current phone and wait for the next best thing on vz until , firmware upgrade .
updated .
on mar 4 , 2010 .
good solid phone .
it 's not an iphone killer , but it works almost everywhere with great call quality -LRB- speaker volumes , etc -RRB- .
pandora , shazam , bloomberg news , google maps , etc are all available which is a plus .
this review is about after 2 weeks , and much can be subject to change i have not ever had a perfect phone , and this is no exception , but so far i 'm satisfied .
this is my third bb through verizon .
i started with the curve and i upgraded to the storm , what a mistake that was .
i decided to switch back to my curve since the storm wasnt working out .
i decided to try my luck on the tour and i 've had it for a week and so far i have not been disappointed there are some minor changes that could have been made to put this phone over the top .
first off , the camera takes beautiful pictures but unfortunately the lag time is no good , similar to that of the storm .
no wi fi is kind of disappointing , but the verizon network makes up for that , still it would have been a nice option .
also , i noticed from the first moment i held my new phone that the battery cover seemed a little loose .
other then that , this is by far the best bb on the verizon network .
previously , i is carrying a phone and an ipod touch .
now i only need the one device to keep me company during my commute to work on the train .
since using bluetooth is a definite drain on the battery , i have had to go back to a tethered headset to avoid the battery being completely drained by the time i get home after work .
with pandora , podtrapper , and viigo , i have all the appls needed to keep me occupied .
i can update later about how the phone work outside the 48 states .
this is a definite great upgrade .
i bought this phone on the day it is released from verizon .
i am a former iphone 3g user .
the call quality is the most important thing for me , after all , its a phone first and i do not have a land line .
as compared to the iphone 3g , the tour blows it out of the water in call quality e mail is great with this phone as is the calendar section cnet complains about the browser but i find it to be equal to the tasks i use a mobile browser for .
facebook integration -LRB- admitted addict -RRB- is good in that i can read my friends updates and leave updates for myself .
the app store while not as extensive as apple 's offers similar apps though a drawback is you only have 256mb of phone memory to save them on the verizon net work is fast and seems to work much faster than at t 3g network as a mac user , it is a little aggravating that there is no workable sycing software for me to use but i managed to get my contacts and calendar 's over and that seems to be enough overall the phone is a good value , especially if you have that new every two credit .
if you are like me and verizon is the best carrier choice then this phone should suit you well .
of all bb i have had , the bold is the best but the service is horrible .
always heard verizon would probably get it , but we got the tour .
the bold casing and housing is way better built than the tour -LRB- which feels plastic y and cheap -RRB- but the bold is huge looking .
is looking for a first bb to run slingplayer on a great network like verizon and they finally did with a hack of loading another file on it .
the storm works with it but its touch screen is slow and i waited for a better bb .
the storm or any other phone will never be an iphone and will never beat it .
i pray one day verizon gets it .
until i see a phone with true browser capabilities -LRB- the iphone is real close -RRB- , no smartphone can compare .
this is the best smartphone for verizon right now and the only reason bb falls short is because of the bb os and hardware in it which causes it to lag .
simply a solid all around phone verizon keeps being evil and not adding the wi fi is simply retarded , adding all their crapware doesnt help either hands off verizon dont mess up a good product .
this phone would easily get 5 stars if -LRB- 1 -RRB- battery life were better -LRB- when using it heavily , you will run out in a few hours .
normal use less than 24 hours -RRB- , -LRB- 2 -RRB- give me my l feature on the front screen back .
overall , outstanding phone and an improvement over my former blackberry curve 8330 .
so far , so good .
i just left my curve 8900 w/t mobile and went to verizon a few weeks ago due to coverage issues .
i first went with a blackberry storm on verizon and hated it for so many reasons .
definitely not the phone for a power messaging gal .
i is able to exchange my storm for the tour yesterday , and am so happy i did .
the tour has many of the features i really missed from my curve 8900 .
a friend of mine who works a local i .
tech firm recently got his hands on this new handset through connections at verizon and i have to say it is a great improvement over verizon 's old blackberry series .
verizon is the best carrier it seems around the downtown los angeles and upper manhattan areas -LRB- where i split my time with work -RRB- i currently own a blackberry bold and can say that there are certain things that the bold has that the tour does n't .
firstly i think the tour 's back is more solid than the bold 's faux leather backing and just feels more secure .
secondly i think the tour 's red numeric accents add a nice touch -LRB- unlike the bold 's all white lettering -RRB- it just makes it easier to read .
style is subjective too so it all depends on what you want while using the phone as a phone/text/internet / email device while i is at work i felt confident while using the phone that it is powerful enough to do everything i needed it to .
i did n't have it long enough to find it worth it to set up my corporate email -LRB- microsoft exchange -RRB- so i can not say how it will work but it is smooth sailing on the blackberry bold which i 'm assuming will work just as well while i is traveling around downtown los angeles i had excellent reception and so did not need wi fi but it is a nice thing to have if you live inn area where you do not pull in 3g speeds .
while i waited for my flight at lax in terminal 4 to jfk signal did drop a bit and at times the web browser is slow although nothing major and nothing too much to complain about touching down at jfk the network automatically changed the time upon my turning on the handset once in the terminal .
signal strength is quite low at points in jfk but it never dropped signal and i is able to talk continuously to a business associate on my way through the terminal all the way out through baggage claim to the curb .
right on , verizon .
the phone also performed well in web browsing .
keep in mind that blackberry 's browser -LRB- while it is a full html browser -RRB- does not perform as well as apple 's safari or even htc 's android browser .
however for my needs it performed well .
text is easy to read and the small cursor makes clicking links a snap the phone itself -LRB- making calls and receiving calls -RRB- performed well -LRB- as previously stated -RRB- and call quality is a tad better over the bold 's .
i personally prefer at t coverage and customer support however it 's all up to the buyer as to what they want to go with .
verizon 's coverage is clear all the way from jfk up to central park and out and around manhattan .
the phone works and clearly excels as a phone .
the speakerphone works well -LRB- though the bold 's stereo speakers do project sound better than the speaker on the tour -RRB- battery life is incredible even with 3g .
-LRB- since blackberry took out wi fi that will make your battery last even longer -RRB- i 'm assuming that blackberry used the same powerhouse 1500mah battery found in my blackberry bold which lasts well up to three days with the phone fully performing .
i did have the phone off during the flight over from lax to jfk so that may also have lengthened the battery life .
however with email , text sms messaging , phone calls , and internet browsing the battery only dropped two and a half bars from 4 am in los angeles to 11 pm in new york city .
rock on , blackberry .
another feature that corporate users -LRB- and others , students too -RRB- will like is the documents to go suite now included in blackberry 's operating system .
i is able to open word , powerpoint , and excel files without a hitch from my email when sent as an attachment .
documents to go worked better than the office mobile on windows mobile phones .
just something to think about .
iphone does not have this capability .
just thought i 'd mention that .
i 'm not a big fan of the iphone since it seems way to standard now days .
it 's silly to compare an iphone to this since they 're in two different categories if you 're thinking about the tour and do not have verizon please check coverage in your area before signing on with them .
again the tour does not have wifi so you 're relying heavily on verizon having coverage in your area .
if you all ready have verizon , and you 're up for an upgrade , then heck .
go for it .
i personally would not choose this phone but it is one sick powerhouse phone that will outperform most other smartphones .
excellent work , blackberry and verizon .
updated .
on jul 7 , 2009 .
i still love my iphone .
play with one first before buying .
the tour does everything you want it to , and with the apps and ability to integrate ms office functionality this device really delivers the goods where it comes to productivity enhancements .
but how on earth do the folks at rim verizon expect us to get any work done with such a meager battery .
the rim website says this battery delivers 5 hours talk time 14 days standby nonsense .
if you give this phone a full charge , and let it sit overnight without any usage , you will wake up to a battery that is 10 % 20 % discharged -LRB- i .
5 1 battery meter bar missing -RRB- .
that really is very poor .
the bulk of my time is spent in areas with 3 5 bars of signal , and i am not a heavy user as such so i know i 'm not skewing the numbers in any significant way .
now condier the fact that lion batteries lose significant power over the course of 12 months , and you can see the real problem by the time i 'm due for a phone upgrade , i will have gone through 3 batteries .
i 've also noticed that when the radio signal is turned off due to low battery power , i can not get it reactivated immediatley after plugging in to a charger .
with my old 8703e , i could plug in , wait for about 3 minutes and then reactivate the radio signal which allowed me to continue to receive phone email service while my phone would recharge .
i have not yet seen that ability to resume service in the tour the only other issue , and its a minor one , is with the number of icons on the desktop and the fact that some of them are a bit redundant and identical too .
it creates a little more button pressing than needed , but this is not a huge issue the battery life , however , is a really significant problem , and its entirely possible that i may have to give this phone back which would be a shame since i otherwise really like it .
this is a great device that is darn near perfect , but with one serious flaw that has afflicted blackberry 's since the introduction of third party applications if you have a 32gb iphone , you can download 32gb worth of applications if you want .
for some reason on the blackberry they partition up the storage and do n't allow you to store a high volume of app 's even on a media card .
the result is a very limited ability to download applications from blackberry app world .
this takes what is otherwise a darn near perfect device and turns it into something that feels unnecessarily constrained .
blackberry should know that they are competing against the iphone , and the app store is arguably the biggest driver to iphone 's business .
blackberry released their version , called app world , which is growing in its usefulness everyday .
however , when you can only download 4 or 5 applications to your device , you suddenly miss the virtually limitless application abilities on the iphone the blackberry tour works on a better network -LRB- verizon -RRB- , using a far superior email platform to iphone 's activesync , has global capabilities including the option to have unlimited global data roaming for a fixed rate , which you can not do with an iphone .
you also get to enjoy using a network that is not oversubscribed , such as is the case with at t thanks to millions of iphones added to the network virtually overnight reliability is rock solid .
battery life is great .
it does n't have wi fi , but i really do n't think you need it with verizon 's 3g speed i is going to give this thing 5 stars , but the continued inability to store a reasonable number of applications seems downright foolish and inexcusable .
blackberry 's product development team needs to wake up and update the os so we can install applications on a media card .
do that and you have a 5 star device with the blackberry tour oh yea , and it does not have a touchscreen hallelujah .

i love rim and the blackberry , my last three devices have all been blackberrys , but this just feels like a qwerty rehash of the storm .
when will rim realize that they are trailing others and get to developing a new os , one that consumers will be happy with as well as secure for the business minded .
we need wi fi .
not having wi fi in a smarphone in 2009 is just absurd .
we consumers need the option to connect via wi fi , its inexcusable that rim makes it for us im tired of the ugly and boring black text on white background that is bb 's os .
at least give us option to change the background like we can the fonts , and not by downloading some half ass theme overall , the device is decent , it just feels like other device makers are leaving rim in the dust .
im going to return this and wait for a better device to come out , hopefully sooner than later .
the volume for phone ring and messages and the microscopic print and having to attempt to read web sites that are not apps when zooming in are my biggest gripes .
i love the speed on the apps and the lay out on the screen where all the options are that took quite a bit of thinking .
i think that i would prefer have stayed with my blackberry curve though .
things might get better after the learning curve i am in updated .
on may 16 , 2010 .
add wifi and i would consider buying it , otherwise i am keeping my old crackberry with wifi , till i die .
having used this type of hand held device , i must say it would be so nice to just have a screen and no more qwerty board interference .
yes , mother .
i can type as much as i need to , which is no more typing , thanks .
and those laptops and netbooks could use two screens with gui qwertys if they absolutly must go the way of the typewriter hang up thing .
i have owned this phone for a year and a half and have really regretted it .
it does not perform well and takes way too may steps to make it do anything .
the icons all look the same so it 's hard to find things quickly .
to make phone calls you have to select the person , click , select home or mobile , click , then it asks you if you want to call and you have to click again .
i have no idea why this phone has received such rave reviews .
i can not imagine what the phones before it must have been like .
i can not wait until my 2 years on this phone are up and i can get a new phone using verizon 's new in two program .
hopefully the iphone will be available on verizon then .
i will never buy a blackberry again .
to do the most basic functions , like send a text message , you have to pick through a menu with hoards of items you do n't need at the time .
this phone is the opposite of intuitive .
it is often the case that the most needed function buried .
and named similarly with other items that are not needed .
the text log is not chat style , and a conversation with one person may take up screens full of texts .
i 'm not sure an easy way to describe this , except to say that text conversations are easy to start but hard to continue on this device coming from a palm treo , where i had up , down , right , left , buttons , several more useful buttons , and the entire touch screen , i is immediately disabled by this phone .
evidently , style is more important to this blackberry than function there is a back button , which has no consistent meaning it sometimes means go back , sometimes means exit and choose to save or discard , sometimes means exit without saving and losing everything you took time to enter .
there is a red hangup / poweroff button which sometimes means exit , sometimes means go back .
consistency is not a concept with the designers of this phone the button which brings you context menus will give you all the options in the world .
if you want to send your text message , good luck send is half way down the list you can not train yourself to do anything quickly on this phone , or else risk losing data .
it 's hard to convey the frustration i 've had with this phone except to say that i often have the thought do they think i have all the time in the world to deal with their phone .
there are shortcuts and shortkeys that solve some of these hassles , if you do not mind to study crackberry .
com , and if you have all the time in the world one of the biggest limitations to me is the inability to select some text and copy it to another application .
sometimes it 's possible , sometimes not .
selecting is a minefield anyway because the same scroll wheel you use to select is also the one that takes you out of the frame a good example of utter stupidity is the media player .
try to increase the volume with the volume buttons .
suddenly it has advanced to the next track , because the buttons mean the same .
the up button is also the advance button .
it depends on how long you pushed it .
but only sometimes , not all situations .
let 's say you want to stop playback because you are in a quiet place .
if you were in another application at the time , good luck .
you can not stop the playback until you navigate through all the applications back to the media player , find the album you were playing , or the now playing function , open it , and find the pause button .
but beware , pause only works for so long .
an hour later in the meeting , suddenly the player starts booming your song again and you have no way to hush it immediately .
sound is a big hassle with this device , because the silent setting does not listen to the other settings .
my phone has been on silent in a meeting with new clients and suddenly broadcast the sound of an incoming text very loudly .
you have to go deep to find the fault .
it is a volume set specifically for that sound , that overruled the silent mode many of these hassles can be mitigated through careful study and possibly some expense in better applications .
if you really want to have this phone , it will honor your needs and wishes some of the time , and you may be satisfied .
especially if you have a lot of time on your hands to set it up right .
which reminds me of the settings very very limited .
on treo , i had a setting menu for everything .
boy is i spoiled last item which affects me a lot if the phone runs out of batteries , and i plug in a charger and need to make a call .
the charger does not bring the phone back to life immediately .
rather , it starts a 2 10 minute process of recharging before the phone will let me use it again .
blackberry must view it 's customers with disdain , like our time is worthless .
not a good phone , is flimsy , as i described can not even use it , i am using my old blackberry world edition phone , the 8830 now , which has no camera you can not depend on the tour to last any amount of time , it is a shame .
so , now we have to genuflect because this is an upgrade .
what a waste of resources and time i changed units because i ditched at t 's lousy service and switched to verizon .
in the process , the default is to give me a better phone .
so i accepted the tour , thought it about equal to the world edition i used for years , and then shockingly tried to charge it with one of the dozen bb chargers in my three households , and found that it is not compatible .
what the ^ ^ ^ % .
what were they thinking .
i am currently using the bb curve 8330 on verizon .
i 'm up for ne2 , and have been in and out of the verizon store playing with this phone , but just see no reason to change .
first of all , this phone , like the curve , has no wi fi .
i du n no , not that i really need it , but hey bb , you put wi fi on the storm , and the storm2 -LRB- which also is going to suck -LRB- with a slightly better version of the same horrible keyboard what are you guys doing . -RRB-
-LRB- please prove me wrong -RRB- why not put wi fi on the tour .
i like the screen , but the browser seems about as -LRB- un -RRB- usable as the one on my current curve .
i mean , on a continuum of web browsers on phones , between my curve and the geohdee iphone , there is no question that the tour 's browser is way closer to the curve .
why spend more money on the same sht .
you do n't get rich wasting money .
i 'd rather be rich than throw $ 200 at some bs .
the worldphone feature of this will have way more value as something to brag about -LRB- for most dudes , than females -RRB- than any real life practicality .
if i 'm not here , i 'm somewhere for work , they can figure out my world internet solution thanks plus , the 8820 already had the worldphone feature .
if i had that , no way i 'm getting this .
unless i wanted a camera lol .
this is just a higher res 8830 with a camera , or , a higher res 8330 with world features .
congratulations for such leaps forward two years later bberry .
while the screen is nicer , the overall benefit over other phones is minimal as the web browser still sucks and there is still not enough real estate to truly surf .
my hope for the droid stems at least 40 % from the fact that i want to upgrade and berry 's current options are so uncompelling .
i can not believe you guys stuck with a different version of the same horrible hardware for the storm2 as well -LRB- nah this one vibrates yeah you still have to press the screen hard , but at least the screen does not move this time -RRB- .
get a life .
or , more preferable , please prove me wrong .
i purchased the blackberry pearl after having a full size blackberry phone for work .
i expected them to work the same , with the pearl being smaller .
well , they do not work the same .
this device randomly decides when it will erase all text messages on my phone .
it typically occurs when someone sends me a message -LRB- and if i 'm looking at the phone when the message is received , i 'll see the text received indicator light up , go off and then everything is erased before i can even get to the new text i know this because i texted it from my other phone to ensure it is working and discovered this ` glitch ' is taking place -RRB- .
at this point , the blackberry pearl will not receive another text message without immediately deleting it unless the device is shut completely down and then turned back on .
this would n't be so bad if it only took 30 seconds to turn back on but my blackberry pearl literally takes 5 minutes to restart from being completely off .
i do n't typically ever turn my phone off so with this being a requirement on the blackberry pearl -LRB- to restart every few days -RRB- , it 's a big inconvenience and becomes frustrating .
especially when you do n't know who texted you or for what also , there are many times the device wo n't ring for incoming calls and goes straight to voicemail for the incoming caller so if they do n't leave a message , you do n't even know you missed a call .
i also like listening to music via the media player and if you receive a text or phone call while using this feature , the phone will continue to play the song and will not give you the option to pause or stop the song unless you do the 5 minute restart , yet again also , you can not send normal picturemail using this device .
you have to send it via email .
also , if you want to dial a phone number containing letters , you better remember the lay out of the letters on the traditional phone as the blackberry pearl does not have them listed with the qwerty lay out .
so if you want to dial a , b , or c , you must know that 's a 2 .
may not be a big deal to some , but it gets frustrating .
also , sending a picture with a normal network phone , it takes moments but with the blackberry pearl windows based phone , it takes minutes , like 3 5 minutes and sometimes after waiting that long , it wo n't send unless you do the 5 minute restart again .
also , videos take even longer and if the video is over say like 20 seconds , good luck with getting it uploaded because i 've never succeeded and i have tried .
i had downloaded the yahoo application on my phone to have easy access to my yahoo email but the phone does not have enough memory to handle that and then function as it should -LRB- even worse with any application installed -RRB- .
so i have removed the yahoo application to get back the majority of function and only have to restart my phone every other day or so .
i like the look of the phone , but that 's it .
also , the cover on the battery is just a very thin piece of plastic and this appears to not be a very durable phone , it has n't broken yet , but i am very careful with it ; however the back does normally pop off with any little bump .
the trackball also freezes up -LRB- like it 's gummed up which is normal with use the oils from your fingers are going to adhere to the trackball so there must be a way to clean it -RRB- .
i see no way to clean it so i will have to take it in to test my patience as i wait in line at sprint so that hopefully i get a representative that will actually know how to do this and send me back on my way with the flawed device .
lastly , if you have the phone on vibrate and in your pocket , you will never feel it vibrate unless you are extremely still .
any move of the trackball and the vibration stops .
personally , this phone is the worst choice i have made .
i have only had this phone for about 8 months or so and i am completely dissatisfied with it and am now looking at paying for another phone to replace it since i 'm not eligible for an upgrade just yet .
so do not buy a blackberry pearl , if someone gives you one , enjoy smashing it to little pieces or explore different ways to destroy it because that 's the only joyful thing i can see in my phones future .
good luck to you .
a must have bb if you travel out of the us and use verizon if you get one with a bad track ball , just trade it out get vlingo for dictating texts and emails it keeps you hands free while driving visual voicemail is a real time saver .
get a case from seidio .

updated .
on sep 9 , 2009 .
in my personal opinion i like the bberry curve 8330 much better .
i had a lot more cons to list but is limited to 250 characters in the cons field .
i 'm on my 2nd tour due to ppl complaining that my voice sounds muffled which is a common problem .
i never had a problem with the curve .
its definitely not a batch issue since the 1st i got directly from vz shipped to my house and 2nd from vz store -LRB- in box -RRB- .
battery life sucks and the os is buggy with delays .
i tried updating os and removing apps i did n't need but still have delays .
i do n't know why rim could n't use the old mini usb charger and leave the port location in the same location as the curve .
battery cover is jiggley on both phones -LRB- once again poor design -RRB- .
this is not a durable phone , if dropped there is a good chance it would break .
if you sit on this phone by mistake there is a good chance the lcd will be damaged .
on the curve there is a tough screen cover that is more durable .
i sat on my curve mistakenly many times and never damaged the lcd .
the trackball is more recessed , some ppl like it and some dont and i do not .
however the trackball is more accurate the main issue with this phone is that ppl on the other end can not hear you clearly unless you hold it a specific way to speak directly into the mic .
the person will not be able to hear you clearly if you hold it with shoulder .
i is really looking fwd to this phone and am really disappointed .
i am definitely going back to my curve 8330 for now .
i hope this critical review helps .
i wish someone wrote this for me before i bought this phone .
this phone is not for someone who is critical , picky , comparitive , or geeky .
i fit all of those .
how can rim ignore imap users .
the cnet review is wrong about the tour supporting imap email battery life is not what i expected from a blackberry web browser is limited at best , not much better than my 2 yr old moto q do not buy a blackberry if you are an independent power user .
it is geared towards enterprise server users .
just not the right bb for me i went back to my pearl and am hoping for a new suretype keypad from rim -LRB- not that silly pearl flip -RRB- in the relatively near future .
after switching over finally from alltel to verizon this past week saw the tour decided on getting it rather than the env touch after three days of playing with the tour just not for me i 'm sure i 'm in the minority on this one as it is probably rated the best bb around right now seems to be more geared for bizness folks just did not have what i need or want in a multi functional cell phone bottomline i returned it to verizon and got the lg env touch for me the best of both worlds a touch screen and a ` full ' keyboard inside i like it a lot so far .
i 'm horribly disappointed the blackberry continues to produce phones with anemic amounts of memory .
i 've waited 2 years to upgrade my blackberry 8830 .
wow , i can go from 64 mb to 256 mb of application and data memory .
or i can buy a 32 gb iphone .
tough choice i can add an sd card to the blackberry , but that 's only good for media -LRB- photos and music -RRB- not applications and data .
bummer .
i guess they must have some very fundamental limitations in their os that they can not manage to program around -LRB- even though they have no had years to do so .
nice keyboard but other manufacturers have now matched blackberry 's ease of use thumb texting style qwerty .
claiming to be a world phone but no with wifi .
very disappointed .
this is my 3rd blackberry and my last one .
the locked down operating system wo n't let you change the default browser , it 's always blackberry 's way or the highway with everything .
they are almost as bad as iphone .
you have to dance around they operating system with patience and reservedness .
do not the manufacturers understand that we are living in the information age , all the power is in the hands of the consumers , not the higher hierarchy marketing machine .
no more for me .
next phone android .
goodbye blackberry .
thanks for the 1000 's of battery pulls .
short battery life .
dropped calls .
poor call quality -LRB- to the other person -RRB- .
calls go straight to voicemail without phone ringing .
takes hours for voicemail / text message alerts .
poor reception .
charging port loose , often wo n't charge when plugged in .
track ball gets stuck .
phone freezes up .
random restarts and upgrades that leave the phone down for hours .
memory wipe out -LRB- including address book -RRB- after restarts and upgrades .
wo not sync with computer .
world 's s l o w e s t internet .
i 've been through 3 phones in 5 months and finally convinced verizon to replace it with a different model .
i 've spent more time on hold with customer service for verizon and blackberry over the last 5 months than i spent over my previous 7 years of cell phone ownership .
i am getting a droid as soon as my contract will let me .
if my replacement phone is as big of a headache as the tour has been , then i will just pay the penalty to break my contract and change providers .
nightmare .
i really wanted to give 0 start because of horrendous experience with this phone .
i mean the way phone is designed is fine .
i liked working with it .
but it crashed too many times and at times , it would crash with the fatal 552 error .
if you type error 552 blackberry on google , you 'll see what i mean .
this problem is so rampant , it happened to me many times causing me to replace the phone 4 times already .
of course , verizon techs and rim techs deny that this is widespread or common problem , but the simeple google search will tell you otherwise let me back track a bit .
when i first got this phone , it is very easy to get accustomed to with low learning curve , very easy to use ui , functional , i just loved the phone .
i did n't care it did n't have the trendy touch screen .
the phone is practically perfect for me however , when i installed several apps like ap news , poynt and so on , it started acting weird .
i would see that delay icon -LRB- clock -RRB- often and system became very sluggish .
also , battery drain is very severe .
it actually drained in half a day on a full charge without calling anyone .
this happens often and to clear it up , you need to do battery pull which clears the memory .
however , even with battery pull , battery barely lasted a day with very light call volume .
i could n't use this phone the following day without charging it overnight every night now , about the battery pull , i 'm still not sure what the exact problem was .
rim tech would n't tell me the real answer either .
in fact , he told me this is a very rare problem .
load of bull they had a work around for this problem on their web site months ago which did n't work .
so they 've been aware of this problem for quite some time .
again do the google search on error 552 .
very common problem so what exactly is a error 552 .
i have no idea .
but what it does is the phone hangs with error message 552 and does n't finish booting up .
only way to work around it is -LRB- which verizon techs did n't know how to do -RRB- reinstall the operating system basically wiping everything in the memory .
you 'll essentially lose everything since last backup initially , verizon techs claimed it 's certain unstable 3rd party software that were causing this problem .
google it and it becomes obvious very fast that there is not certain program that causes it , but this happens from installing or unstalling wide array of softwares which mostly are approved by rim and verizon -LRB- since they are available on blackberry appworld -RRB- but also from battery pull which is essential to keep the system marginally functional so how rampant is this problem .
in january , i had to replace my phone twice because every known work around did n't work .
on february , i had to replace it twice because of same reason .
however , to give them credit , rim finally found work around which verizon techs were n't aware of .
however , after doing the work around , it happened to same phone on the same day .
so verizon determined it might be hardware problem and replace it second time for february i got so sick of spending hours of trying to restore it and failing , days of waiting for new phones to arrive , i asked them to give me a different phone .
anything but this one .
currently , i 'm waiting for a new storm 2 to arrive in replacement .
i 'm not sure if that 's a good thing or what as storm tends to have bad track record with quality issues .
reading reviews from other users , it seems that all blackberries have mechanical key not working issues and this necessity of battery pull due to sluggish performance after replacing the phone average of 2 times a month , i 'd advice anyone to stay clear of this phone .
i do n't care how good ui is or email client is .
if it keeps having irrecoverable crashes , product does not belong in the market as it is too unstable for release .
my 2 cents .
the first few days with this phone , i thought it is great .
this is in the summer of 2009 when it first came out .
now , here at the end of january , i 'm ready to switch from verizon because of the problems with this phone .
they are sending me a replacement phone on wednesday , but if the replacement still has a trackball and does n't get better reception and allow me to not drop as many calls , i 'm going back to at t .
for the reception problem , i 've removed the global sim , turned off the global choice and set to 1exv signal at all time all to no avail .
still have 2 -LRB- really 1 .
5 -RRB- bars in my house -LRB- almost pinpoint in the middle of miami -RRB- and lose almost every call that i receive at home .
-LRB- it happens away from home also . -RRB-
i am really hoping that the replacement they send me is better .
if not , i 'm going to try to downgrade to an earlier version blackberry -LRB- bold or curve -RRB- and if they wo n't let me do that , it 's so long verizon they do not have a map for that .
1 -RRB- the battery is sub par and runs out of juice before your day is done .
the curve lasted all day 2 -RRB- the mouse ball is too close the the key board , so when i type messages , i frequently accidentally brush the mouse ball which then inserts the cursor into the middle of the message .
this requires a re write of almost every email , text and bbm i send .
the curve did not have this problem 3 -RRB- many of these devices -LRB- including the original one i bought -RRB- have defective mouse balls and bugs in the software that render the mouse ball useless when moving horizontally .
this problem is only solved when i exchanged the device for a new one -LRB- which required hours of transferring contacts and other data -RRB- .
the curve did not have this problem i would not buy the tour unless you have verizon and absolutely must have the sim card feature .
even then , if you can , find another phone .
would have been a great phone if research in motion 's quality control is better than this .
not only does the tour have faulty hardware , it does not work well as a phone .
this is a wonderful , expensive pda , not a smartphone .
i replaced the phone twice and ultimately returned it .
shame on rim for putting out such a poorly constructed phone .
bought this for advertised e mail capability .
i can not access my work e mail nor can my wife to hers .
i can not even access my personal e mail account as the broswer keeps kicking me off .
what good is getting an e mail -LRB- business -RRB- then having to cc your self on the replies .
log in to the company outlook is not possible so that 's that .
went to a birthday party for a relative and my 17 yr old nephew with his goofy i phone could easily do what my new fangled blackberry could not like get on my e mail .
total crap do not buy .
save your money and do not listen to hype .
i am a hard core business person and this thing is useless .
i could careless which phone anyone gets so this is unbiased proof is my pimpled nephew who easily logged on to a three different -LRB- secured -RRB- sites and my wife and i were able to get into our stuff .
blackberry no .
you do the math .
no , not getting an i phone just a regular phone and a lot less aggravation .
i got the tour thinking that it 's going to be better than at ts bold .
i is wrong .
the phone freezes on a regular basis .
the microphone is horrible .
you have to keep the microphone on a certain angle .
if you lay down and talk , the person on the other sided will not hear you .
if you think my phone is defective , try it yourself .
call yourself with your land line and put some music on the tour and move it a little .
you 'll see what i am talking about .
the browser is bad .
last but definitely not least the bluetooth is horrible .
i have has several different cell phones from verizon and they work fine .
motorola , lg , and even the blackberry curve .
i have a 2007 acura tl stype and when the tour connects to it , the person on the other side say that they can barely hear me .
i just want to know why verizon has such good service , but they do not come out with working phones .
bottom line if you want to get yourself in more stress buy the tour .
i recommend the blackberry curve .
it will cost you $ 50 rather than $ 200 after all the rebates .
the curve compared to the tour is flawless .
i 've had this phone 7 months .
it 's my first blackberry -LRB- well , technically 2nd , because my first one had such a loud whine in the speakers i had to trade it in .
the 2nd one still has it , just not as bad -RRB- .
as soon as my contract is done , i 'm out .
the service truly is great -LRB- except for the high # of dropped calls at least 1 2/day -RRB- , but that 's verizon , not the blackberry .
i 'd be totally willing to compromise that to have a phone that works .
what i wrote above is about 1/2 of all the little things that have gone wrong with this phone , with the latest being how often it freezes , sometimes taking a half hour to come out save yourself a huge headache and go with the company that knows how to create a quality electronic product .
every friend of mine with an iphone loves , it , every friend with a blackberry either hates it or is less than pleased .
first , i have been a smartphone user since the original flip phone treo , moving to various palm devices , several iterations of the blackberry curve .
this tour is the worst smartphone device i have owned it is virtually unusable for me .
i am a power user , constantly on internet , texting , calling , etc .
my blackberry curve handled this workload fine .
the tour struggles voice quality is very poor , listeners struggle to understand what i 'm saying .
likewise , reception is very poor , and i struggle to understand what the other person is saying .
i have many dead areas in verizon reception that i am trying to have them resolve -LRB- and i live in a major city , san antonio -RRB- .
the texting has about a 15 second delay from when you push enter to send how annoying is that .
and when i receive a text that someone in my directory has sent me an email , it takes 15 20 minutes for that email to actually arrive in my inbox so that i can respond to it .
ridiculous .
web surfing is an absolute pain , taking much longer than at t 's web experience .
some sites -LRB- eg espn on weekends -RRB- wo not even come up .
and battery life is much less than the curve , which could last for days it seemed , the tour is lucky to make it through the day .
i would highly recommend someone looking at this device go with the at t bold 9700 , which i am in the process of switching to .
it seems many of these faults have been corrected in the bold 9700 , in reading the reviews from engadget , boy genius report , cnet , crackberry , etc .
i switched to verizon because my company switched , i is perfectly happy with my at t bold so to throw pity my way my company let me upgrade to the tour while all the other pee ons at my company had to slum it with the curve haaaaa .
i thought to myself as i un boxed what i thought is simply a smaller , more streamlined bold i is a fool .
this device is no bold .
they should call it the blackberry booooo .
it 's trackball is possessed .
it jumps over apps , zips over text , you roll right it rolls left , sometimes it wont move at all .
aargh .
the phone resets itself twice a day , the bluetooth stays connected even after you end the call worthless .
it looks as though the status quo for verizon is to always get it right the second time around so skip the tour and wait for tour 2 im going to a storm 2 at least after a year all the bugs should be gone and there is no trackball for them to ruin .
essentially , whenever you have an incoming call , text , email and are using any audio or video player , it locks up .
it does this to my camera , video , internet radio -LRB- slacker pandora -RRB- and even when i do n't get a call just it searching for a tower i have returned one of these already in the first 10 days of ownership and will ultimately switch either phones , or manufacturers entirely .
in my 13 years with wireless devices , this is the worst one ever not because it does not have cool features , but because the software platform is not stable do not buy one .
i do not know what rim did to the antenna on this model , but i recommend staying with your older blackberry or try another .
verizon swapped out the unit at no charge and it made no difference .
stay away .
wait for the next phone .
wish i had .
do n't waste your time with this phone .
it is indeed a huge disappointment .
i decided to go back to my old 8830 with no camera until vzw comes out with something more solid .
i had the iphone for a ver short time and liked it but unfortunately it is on att 's service which is awful .
the iphone has its issues too but the tour is a huge disappointment .
i truly do n't understand rim 's quality assurance .
for them to release the tour and the storm and the phones to have so many issues really shows how terrible their quality control is .
they really need to get it together and produce a solid phone that does not delete messages and fail miserably when really put to use .
i already sent back one tour and got a second that 's almost as bad .
i 'm sending that back too because i can not take that people can not hear me .
bberry produced a lemon .
go with anything else in the bberry lineup .
not this one .
hi everyone , .
i 'm officially giving up on the tour .
i 've gone through multiple units each have had issues including faulty trackball -LRB- no horizontal movement -RRB- , poor reception/muffled sounds clarity , and even not being able to charge .
i returned them all and am happy to be back on my 8830 .
maybe i 'll try again in a few months , but for a device that has a full retail of close to $ 500 , these issues should not be happening .
i encourage you not to settle or feel bad about getting a refund or exchange .
how will rim ever learn otherwise .
it 's your money , your going to be stuck with this device for the next 2 years , get what you want http / / forums .
crackberry .
com/f141/tour number five bs 292732 / .
two dixie cups and 20 feet os string is a major upgrade .
do not waste your time on this one .
you can not clean the trackball .
they told me at verizon that this phone has had lots of trackball problems .
headphone jack on first tour broke after three uses .
took it back to verizon .
they sent me refurbished one .
that jack did n't even fit .
while in store , i checked my cable on all the display phones .
it fit fine in all the curves , storms and every other phone with a 3 .
5 jack .
they sent me a third one -LRB- new this time -RRB- .
still did not work .
rim completely missed it here .
if you want to listen to music through your car 's aux jack , get something else .
the worst phone i ever had .
i have used many smart phones over the years and blackberry had been producing a good product in the past , but my tour sucks .
the replacement tour they sent me also sucks .
the trackball is very unreliable and moves left when you want it to go to the right .
i have done everything recommended including adjusting the sensativity and i have to say that after 6 months i am actually pissed at how much my phone sucks .
i would strongly recommend against purchasing this phone as i have buyers remorse x10 .
i just bought a motorola android for my wife and that is a good phone .
overall a so so phone but the new curve is much better in terms of internet and trackball -LRB- or track pad -RRB- .
very unhappy with it if i had to pay the full price for it , i 'd be really mad .
tmobile $ 35 less .
w / wifi too , that the bb tour does not .
and the mytouch is lots more fun .
battery lasts 2 days .
which is amazing after just returning that phone and especially dont forget the jacked up prices verizon has .
-LRB- more than any other cell carrier -RRB- .
i live in ca , where hands free is a mandate by law .
i am a big user of bluetooth headsets and , unfortunately , the tour is plagued with either a hardware or software issue that prevents the outbound call receiving party from hearing the conversation .
i have tried multiple tours , with multiple headsets .
i eventually had to return my latest tour and unwind my contract .
i hope to be able to re purchase another tour some day , but not until i have some level of comfort that they have corrected and tested the next release of the product .
it took the storm 7 months for an os update and i do not wish to lock myself to verizon for 2 years without some assurances of a well functioning product .

Rolling track ball can drive you insane Very good display , call quality and internet speeds. ; Battery Life ; Slightly Cluttered Menu Interface .
Great screen resolution , nice keyboard , nice response time. ; No Wi-Fi , ca n't save apps to memory card .
Blackberry rock !
I would always choose the brand ... So useful ... email on the go ... .

Read below Good sound , decent picture , and durable. ; Fair picture for tv , no radio am/fm .
Needs better track ball , I change the phone , min three times , maybe 4 none bad phone ; locks up sound phone crash and leaves you with out phone verizon want stand behind the phone the say no one has trouble The display , keyboard , and camera are all improved over the 8330 ; none so far , 2 months in Size , keyboard , sound -LRB- thru speaker phone and receiver -RRB- , screen , trackball , body , speaker phone quality , sound quality of call , accessories included in box. ; MIcro USB , camera , bezel , button size on keypad , Everything - design , keyboard , easy to use ; Bluetooth - callers can barely hear me when I 'm using the car bluetooth kit .
track ball lags a bit .
no wi fii Bright screen , unmatched email , Bberry apps , VERIZON RECEPTION !
, nice size , qwerty keyboard ; Keyboard is cramped , trackball can numb your thumb after long use , battery cover slides around more of a nuisance .
camera , size , mms and finally Verizon has preloaded more software than previous models ; no wifi and stil has buggy BB OS -LRB- freezes , reboots , lags -RRB- , browser is better but still not great graphics are good .
Keys are ok for typing ; Browser is bad , can not connct to any e-mail server , Business e-mail come through byt replies are not logged on to work out look so you better Cc yourself !!
It has all the features I will need. ; A little heavier than the curve but not a big deal .
I agree with many complimentary observations , i.e. display , G3 etc. ; WHY OH &#38; * ^ $ % ^ WHY did the CHANGE THE POWER INPUT !!!!????!!!! This is NOT a standard mini USB connection .
EVERY LEGACY power supply is USELESS .
And not compatible with EVERY OTHER BB CHARGER IN EVERYONE 's POSSESSION !!!???? So far good phone quality , very fast web browsing , uploading my own ringtones. ; When it arrived it was slow at first .
But its picked up and has been good so far .
Beautiful display , camera takes good pictures , nice looking device ; Others I called complained of muffled sounding call quality , screen is incredibly sensitive , trackball malfunctioned , loose battery door , LONG reboot time , poor charging port placement Pros : 1 .

Some have had faulty trackball .
2 .
Battery life .
3 .
Fingerprint magnet .
4 .
Browser is just OK , could be better Its a very slick phone .
Camera takes good pictures , but it 's slow !!
; Read my Cons and bottom line in the bottom line section .
Not enough room in this section .
Size , menu , camera quality , screen , verizon network , copy/paste , beside mode ; Battery could be a bit better , but at least the phone charges very rapidly .
Its pretty , not real heavy. ; This model seems to have a lot of problems .
Changes ringtone , sometimes calls go straight to voice-mail , locks up , texting problems -- do n't get all texts that are sent .
This last one keypad totally stopped working maybe loose connection .
-LRB- test post -RRB- Very speedy , feels nice in your hands , touch mouse is light years ahead of the mechanical mouse that often failed in previous Blackberry models. ; This is a test post .
I do a great deal of work from my phones and Blackberry had always been a reliable phone previously. ; Track ball sucks Nice screen , device feels nice in hand , nice qwerty keyboard , good music player .
Camera actually took nice pictures. ; No WI-FI , same antiquated OS , cant save apps to memory card , outrageous price for MS Office Apps .
Awful browser , although you can download better ones .
Camera needs to be faster , sending pics via MMS took forever , emailing them was quicker .
Awesome Call Quality .
Great E-mail .
Good integration with Facebook ; Keyboard is difficult for someone with big fingers .
No good syncing software for the Mac .
Ca n't save apps to Micro SD card Excellent call quality .
It is very easy to use .
This is my first Blackberry after being a long time Treo user .
This is much more reliable than my Treos ... no resets !
Excellent form factor. ; None to date Screen . .
Keyboard -LRB- I like the non-cheap feeling keys .
Curve keys feel `` loose '' to me -RRB- . .
Weight - feels solid .
Display - way more sharp and modern than the Pearl . .
Trackball - Smoother and less rattly than the Pearl .
Case - Silicone case fits better. ; Almost too wide for me to use with one hand .
I just love the qwerty keyboard , and the size of the tour , i love all the feathers as well. ; No WI-FI , and no Verizon Mobile TV Qwerty keyboard w / backlighting .
ease of use .
camera is solid .
Quality messaging capabilities of Blackberry devices .
Set up was easy ; App process could be a little simpler , though updates to Blackberry App World have improved this .
Visual Voicemail , Slightly raised corners on keys make texting a little easier , ease of use , easy email integration , almost endless possibilities in profile setup for phone , mail and messaging , overall astethics. ; Could have had a better camera and more ` theme ' choices .
Works well , mostly intuitive. ; BB assumes you understand their language .
Search for calendar on their website and you find nothing -- you need to know they call it desktop manager .
The keys are very small .
The earphones are too small to fit in my ears and are worthless .
Clear screen display , looks nice , bedside mode , easy lock button on top , clear camera w / auto focus , charges quick. ; Different charger &#38; usb port location , slightly larger in height and width , microphone is horrible -LRB- on my 2nd phone -RRB- , easy to fatfinger when typing since keyboard is tightly packed with slant , buggy OS , not durable , LCD screen is very sensitive to damage It 's pretty .
That 's all I like about the phone. ; No software updates to correct the software issues . .
LOW Device Memory . .
Over 5 minutes to RESTART device . .
Ca n't send picturemail using this device . .
LOCKS UP , FREEZES &#38; FREQUENTLY DELETES TEXTS which requires a 5 minute RESTART for a temporary fix .
- Thin size .
- Excellent Color .
- Excellent Speed .
- Nicely Equipped with features such as Navigation system and multiple work and home emails addresses . .
- Facebook friendly ; Battery Life -- get the car charger , it is $ 10 cheaper at Wal-Mart . .
Otherwise , I like it and recommend it .
nice bright LCD screen ... allows POP3 email for Thunderbird ; tiny keys and keyboard ... .
browser disappointed ... heavy and chrome surrounding rim very slippery which along with it being too thin and heavy which means you better have insurance on this one . .
that tiny lil ' scroll button is one annoying booger It 's fast , convenient , looks great , feels great , functions great . .
the Keyboard is AMAZING ; No Wifi . .
the 3mp camera is good , but it could be better . .
trackball .
it looses sensitivity after a while but only affects games and really really long messages .
The look and feel ; Had 3 previous blackberries all with the same power plug , why did they change this one ?
Just so I have to go buy another car charger and extra travel charger ?
Global capabilities on a Verizon phone , screen , battery life , performance , size , call quality , email performance is perfect ; Still ca n't save applications to media card , and internal app storage is limited , no wi-fi Everything .
Compared to my Curve , I love the new sleek black color , keyboard , and it has all the features I need. ; None to date so far .
- Its not a Storm .
- Fantastic Screen .
- Great size , weight and shape .
- Blackberry Maps work better than my Garmin -LRB- in a downtown area -RRB- .
- Best Media Player and Manager on a Verizonberry .
- Sweet camera ; - Keyboard is a bit on the small side .
- Charger that is included -LRB- international version -RRB- is too large and make a high pitched hum Email , multi-tasking , battery life , screen resolution ; No WiFi , would have been nice to have a lot of the customizability offered by apps as part of the phone -LRB- different LED colors , flashlight , one key SMS , etc -RRB- , SMS limit of 160 words .
High-Res Screen -LRB- smaller than , and way less useful than the iPhone 's -RRB- .
Verizon 's Service .
The 8830 needed a camera ; No real updates from the Curve . .
For someone with a current VZW Berry -LRB- Curve , and ESPECIALLY 8820 -RRB- there is no real reason to upgrade .
Great , large screen ; QWERTY keyboard ; fast data speeds for emails , browsing .
Works as a PDA. ; When you use the car bluetooth , I sound very far away .
Callers sound muffled .
Trackball feels like it has sand in when going left/right .
Battery door was very loose .
Screen ripples when pressing keypad near the screen .
Nice phone &#38; features , as the old blackberry but this phone just seem to be better ; The battery life is poor , extremely poor &#38; the phone keeps on restarting on its own Decent browser compared to the Curve , 90 % of websites are better , 10 % are nearly impossible to read , high resolution display. ; This phone wo n't go an entire day without locking up , battery life is way shorter -- even with no new apps installed , More RAM , therefore less freezing like the Pearl. ; The cell reception got worse than any Verizon phone I have ever owned .
I have 5 lines with different model phones .
I can be sitting beside another Verizon user with a different Blackberry or other phone .
They have service and I have none .
Small enough to fit in pocket , good OS and looks .
3G speeds and international for Sprint , Camera , Video MMS SMS Multimedia , Expansion Card etc ; No Wi-Fi , but who really uses it that much anyway !?
A-lot of surfing on a Phone ?
Email , browser , camera and screen are all excellent.first blackberry and I am so happy I bought this device .
I say device because it is so much more than a phone. ; OS alittle slow some times but after update from verizon it runs greay Brilliant display .
Large screen .
High amount of memory -LRB- does n't seem to leak -LRB- yet -RRB- the way my Pearl did -RRB- .
Good Camera pic quality for a phone -- though ca n't exactly compare others first hand ; Battery Life seems to drain ridiculously fast . .
Keys take getting used to going from larger SureType Pearl Great screen resolution , Keypad is solid and lets face it no other smart phone can touch B-Berry for email and Calendar sync ... ; Trackball , Trackball , Trackball , and trackball !
Its the center point of the dang phone you would think they would at least get that right !!
bright screen , fast , ability to download apps .
The call quality is fine but people say you are muffled. ; It feels a little frail in your hands .
I almost think that if I drop it anywhere it will break .
no wifi .
mini usb .
GPS , SIM Card , and Resolution. ; I 'm not mad that this phone does n't have wi-fi because wi-fi is highly susceptible to hacks , I do hope that the camera is n't as bad as Bonnie says .
Great phone !
Many new smartphones forget about actual CALLS !
This phone is very easy to hear and be heard and the speakerphone is plenty loud .
The BB App store keeps improving , the new OS is great , and everything is VERY fast !
; No wifi , battery lasts less than 24 hours during normal use -LRB- web browsing , playing games , frequent texting , email , etc -RRB- .
Great keyboard functionality = easy to type .
Blows the iPhone away in this area . .
Love the logical setup of the operating system .
The 10 mailbox ability of the OS is highly functional . .
Applications are plentiful . .
Verizon network is simply the best. ; The phone quality itself is not the absolute best , but it is decent .
The internet works almost like a netbook , with a few exceptions .
Many apps available to expand the functionality. ; Severely limited user interface .
Charger does not make phone operate immediately -LRB- up to 5 minute wait -RRB- .
Makes noise during meetings even when set to silent .
Stupid and slow in general .
A big time waster .
Not ideal for a professional .
Great screen .
I like the built-in GPS for use with Google Maps. ; Battery life is horrible .
Stupid trackball in the middle means I move my cursor by accident when typing .
Blutooth is useless .
Speakerphone is useless .
People say I 'm muffled when on handset .
It takes 11 minutes to reboot .
ELEVEN !
lots of speed on apps and mobile web sites ; I do n't like the part that I ca n't set the amount of rings for the phone and messages or the volume .
At most I have only `` heard '' 3 rings for phone , at the most I have felt 2-3 vibrations.I hate the microscopic print and having to zoom in .
This Phone is awesome it is a major upgrade from the curve that just went out on me .
The Screen is what really makes this phone really nice the resolution is Nuts. ; Nothing at all I love it .
nice upgrade from the 8703e ... love having a camera and messaging upgrades etc ; much harder to type on than the 8703 , why the ` slanted '' keys , thinking about returning this device .
What 's the point of a Blackberry if you ca n't seed type ? .
impossible to see web pages because of small screen and a pain to keep zooming .
- Fast processor .
- minimal lag .
- clear screen .
- great incomming sound .
- best 3g out there with verizon 's evdo -LRB- not technically fastest , but my experience works fastest -RRB- ; - microphone is on bottom of phone , biggest con .
- blackberry changed to a smaller usb charger .
- does n't ship with slip case as curve 8330 did .
I hate holsters , I 'm not batman , do n't need a utility belt .
- loose battery cover I did n't have to pay for it and the company is wasting their money on the monthly bills. ; User interface is the worst .
Phone audio quality is bad .
Web is super slow and unusable .
Over all worst phone ever .
Great Screen Quality . .
Speakerphone .
Keyboard .
Customizable .
Easy to use .
Fast .
Call Quality .
E-mail is quick and easy to set up ; Battery life but thats mostly me because I use my applications a lot . .
Vibrate could be stronger but definitely not a deal breaker .
It 's a Blackberry .
Nice Scrren ; Browser Slow .
Battery Drains way too fast .
Track Ball had fatal issues .
I have had 4 phones in 6 months with track ball issues .
Each time they give me another refurbished phone and it is not any better .
The last phone lasted 48 hours .
Solid , quick , stuning display , ok battery life , media player not bad , great photos and camera , great call quality , reliable , verizon , keyboard is slick and sweet. ; What in the hell where they thinking with this trackball ?
There is some defect with the trackball that is a known issue ; not just me .
Hummm ... I guess the battery life could be a bit longer and ... ummm ... the battery door ; it 's a bit loose .
Design pulls the Curve 8900 , the Storm , and the Bold all into one sleek package .
QWERTY keyboard is like the one featured on the Bold and the 8800 series .
Updated Blackberry OS adds nice design touches and brings a nice update to the older aging OS ; WIFI !!!
Where did it go ?
This is the first blackberry without wifi in recent months . .
Design could use some tweaking love the tour .
its pretty , lovey they keyboard , screen , camera , spell check , design .
to me its almost flawless. ; battery life dosent really compair to my curve 8330 , sad it dosent have a normal usb charger , and reboot time is 9 mins ... my curve was 3 mins . .
I like the features and functions that OS 4.7 gave to the Blackberry , not to mention the 3G capability and the camera missing from my 8830 .
; The fit and finish leaves much to be desired in the initial batches of the device , not to mention the Bluetooth inabilities that the initial batches of the device are plagued with .
They just do n't work as advertised , at least not yet .
Corporate email is pretty solid - still have a few issues with getting my inboxes set up - unable to see messages stored in folders , but I think that 's a setting issue. ; Where to begin ?
Standby button works intermittently , phone freezes regularly , track ball catches terribly , phone drops calls when cradled on shoulder , number pad works 1/2 the time , LED goes off irregularly , speaker has a high-pitched whine , etc. . .
Clear and good-sized screen , comes with the latest BB software which I like , excellent camera. ; I am a prior BB Pearl user and just ca n't get used to the tiny keys on the tour .
I am also disappointed by the weight of the tour .
VZW should have gone with the BB Curve 8900 - MUCH sleeker !
AND - why is the USB port on the other side of the phone ?!
Verizon coverage .
Good phone ; BB Tour is crippled for a non-enterprise user using IMAP .
I could n't get my old emails on my server and worse , when I delete on the Tour , it does n't delete on the server , so I have to also delete when I get back to the office .
Switching between applications , great network reception , and call quality is great .
Blackberry App World is nice to have , more apps each day .
Battery life is excellent . .
Voice dialing thus far has been very accurate. ; Little base memory and apps install to main memory , not exandable SD card .
GPS is slow to receive at first .
Could be easier to manage photos from the camera .
It may look beautiful but believe me you do n't want to date it. ; After using this phone for over a year now feel like I got ripped off .
It was the prototype for the 9700 .
Providers took it off their inventory quick .
It has a buggy roller ball and no wifi .
I ca n't think of a whole lot. ; Very poor camera , virtually useless .
Takes blurry pics , and low-light pics have a red haze .
Browser is super-slow .
Anytime you update the system you have to start from scratch configuring everything as if the phone was brand new .
Edgy style , world travel , bigger screen and bright display , better sound , heavier weight , flash , streaming video ... what 's not to love. ; Ok , I do admit that the shutter lag bugs me a tad and the picture quality could be better , but if there are only two cons for a phone ... come on that 's excellent !
The BB Tour has a sleeker and lower profile design over the BB Bold .
Tour Feels better in palm of hands &#38; fits easier in shirt or pants pockets .
Basically the Tour is a mini Bold in looks &#38; design having a better finished edge &#38; less bulky tha ; No Wifi is a big lost to me over the Bold .
Downloaded Applications ca n't be stored onto Micro SD card .
That 's about it .
Do n't have many Cons .
The pros : The Tour comes with a SIM card so when you travel internationally , you can purchase local SIM cards with a local phone number and save heaps of cash using the local phone system , rather than Verizon 's super expensive off shore rates. ; Terrible battery life . .
Mouse ball too close the the key board .
Many devices have defective mouse balls and bugs in mouse software . .
USB charger has new size plug so you have to buy new chargers and cables to replace the old format used with Curve .
Had to replace the curve 6 times and now I have the Tour .
It is sleek and sexy although the screen reminds me of the storm and its applications , it gives a whole new meaning to my blackberry experience. ; None so far Very nice looking screen and the physical keyboard is nice ; Poor Sound Quality .
Friends ask if I 'm eating my phone .
Trackball sticks &#38; you ca n't navigate the screen .
Battery life is n't very good as well as the os freezes .
Reboot time is too long being that you have to reboot so often .
- Camera is awesome .
- Operating system has yet to reboot/reset , or freeze up .
- NO DROPPED CALLS -LRB- Verizon vs. AT &#38; T -RRB- .
- Much faster downloads than AT &#38; T 3G ; even faster than WiFi .
- Battery life on Tour is far , far better than Bold ; - Verizon limits/restricts some of the Blackberry apps that AT &#38; T allows .
- Call quality ; I 've heard repeated complaints from other end .
- Small internal memory .
- Speaker on Bold -LRB- music and talk -RRB- is better .
- All my Bold chargers are worthless now Improved speed and stability over my previous phone .
Sound quality on my calls is much improved .
I like the keyboard as it is easier to type on ; WIFI would have been great .
Battery life could be better -LRB- 1 -RRB- OS 4.7 is fast and stable , -LRB- 2 -RRB- keyboard is COMFORTABLE !
-LRB- 3 -RRB- browser has improved -LRB- still prefer opera however -RRB- -LRB- 4 -RRB- love the recessed lock and standby buttons , -LRB- 5 -RRB- Rev-A , -LRB- 6 -RRB- SEXY !
;-RRB- ; -LRB- 1 -RRB- Battery Life is horrible !
-LRB- 2 -RRB- because of battery life , Wi-fi would n't be a good option anyway , but i would like both !
-LRB- 3 -RRB- Only 6 icons on the home screen ... what happended to the `` L '' feature ?
its fast , does n't glitch up often , and the internet pages load really well .
I also love how its smaller then the bolder and i can comfortably slide it into my pocket in my jeans. ; NO WI-FI .
That 's the only thing this phones seems not to have , and may be a multiple alarm type deal but i could prob find an application for that .
Well it was a diff , neat look if you will phone. ; Battery life 7-8 hrs , no matter stand by/talk .
Wake up to draind phone every morning .
Need to take charger everywhere .
Colors of and the Apps are horrible .
Manuvering bad .
Music not that good compared to most others .
Text tooo small to type for any1 - Very Fast .
- This really IS a handheld computer .
- Integrates your Facebook contacts with your phone contacts -LRB- even updates the Caller ID photo -RRB- .
- 5 people called me back to back ... and i patched them all in on the same call !
; - Huge Lag on the tracking ball .
Allthough not a deal breaker , still is very annoying !
I 've had to scroll over 9 times before the next icon/app is selected . .
- Still no html view for email .
Everything comes in plain text . .
- Battery Life is mediocre .
I 'm on my 3rd Tour and am extremely unsatisfied .
While the screen is nice and the body has a sleek design , read the cons ... ; INCOMPATIBLE WITH STANDARD BLUETOOTH !
While I had no problems with previous phones , callers can not hear me when I use Bluetooth . .
Battery life is very short . .
Poor audio quality on regular calls . .
SMALL keyboard .
1 .
Beautiful screen .
2 .
Plenty of installed apps . .
3 .
Inclusion of `` docs to go . ''
No subscription this time around . .
4 .
Camera .
5 .
Keyboard is different but easy to use .
6 .
Inclusion of Sounds profile on home screen .
7 .
Speaker phone ; 1 .
Call quality is pretty good but sometimes muffled .
Not a deal breaker but not as clear as my Env Touch . .
2 .
Early reviews noted track ball problems and loose battery cover .
Those issues seem to be fixed .
A good light design for a phone .
It has a brilliant display .
Videos look great on the small screen. ; The two detractors are that the speaker is not as loud and clear as the one that came with the Storm and the battery life really needs to be improved .
Nicest look , touch , feel of any BB to date .
High resolution display , good trackball and keypad layout .
Very good sound quality for phone and music playback. ; Lack of Wi-Fi , but it is not a deal breaker since I would n't have much use for Wi-Fi anyway .
Nice screen , keyboard is easy to use , navigation and web works fine .
options are not hard to navigate around , good picture and video quality. ; short battery life .
I use it for business and keep a car charger handy .
If you do n't listen to tunes and browse all day you should not have a problem .
Remember It 's a phone not your ipod and computer .
Long battery life .
Can use any mp3 you have as a ring tone .
Upload your own pictures and use as wallpaper .
Lots of useful applications for business and students .
Nice crisp pictures and clear sound .
Everything work together seamlessly. ; The Desktop Manager used to transfer files off and onto BlackBerry is very buggy .
The application frozed up on me a few times .
It could also be because I am using Windows Vista .
The usual BB strengths of email , apps and texting . .
Nice to be able to go international now ! .
Camera better , but not as good as DARE. ; Reception down by 2 bars as compared to Curve in same location .
Short battery life - wo n't last all day .
Sound quality is a REAL issue - customers saying they ca n't understand me is a PROBLEM ! .
OS buggy - still get screen freezes that last up to 10 sec .
Fast Processing speeds , snappy with most applications/programs , looks pretty , CDMA and GSM Push emails , etc. . .
, comes with a great holster/case .
Keyboard is not bad to type on , screen good res , camera takes good pics/video .
Takes microSD cards ; So stinkin buggy , Phone call quality mediocre , gets less than the best signal possible , new microUSB , battery life not too good ~ 1 day , Media player goes to beginning if you get a message or phone call !
-LRB- really ? -RRB-
poor position for microusb from watching video 's to email to watching movies this phone does it all .
with the new 5.0 software up date the phone just got a whole lot better .
if you looking for a do it all phone this is the one i have had it for a year and works great ; if you use it like i do get extended life battery or stay close to a plug in it burns battery fast It is so familiar to me as it is so close to the 8830 that I had previously .
It is just a little better , faster , prettier , and has a camera to boot !
I really like the addition of the visual voice mail .
This feature is very productive. ; Just a little smaller than my 8830 and the keyboard is just a bit tighter .
I am genetically cursed with fat thumbs so may not be an issue with those with normal digits .
The phone sound quality is great !
There are a lot of very good apps and I really like the calendar and contact applications . .
The camera is incredible. ; This phone does n't have the Russian language available on it which is a huge problem for me .
For some reason Google Maps runs slow when trying to search for or input information .
Great screen in HD .
Call quality as good or slightly better than my previous Curve .
Faster loading than the Curve .
Have never dropped a call except two floors underground in a parking garage .
Maybe more related to the excellent service of Verizon ; Keys a little on the small side but not a big deal if you have ever used a virtual keyboard .
No Wi Fi not important to me as I have an iPad for that .
Apps not plentiful , but seems to always be one for the important stuff .
The internet is slow .
Organization aspects are amazing - this is my first blackberry so I ca n't compare to others .
But the syncing of the phone book with email contacts and facebook contacts is great .
Calendar , notes , etc. is great .
Easy to use for first time BB owners ; I guess lack of wifi is a con , but it has n't bothered me so far .
Some minor annoyances getting used to the interface , but that probably stems from my unfamiliarity with BB .
Would also like to have more icons on the home screen .
Great functionality , ease of use , capabilities , connectibility , picture and video quality is great , etc. .
I love just about everything on this phone .
I am techno savvy and for my first smartphone , it has been a totally great experience. ; The battery life could be better , but what do you expect for a phone that does all this one does .
The shutter lag on the camera does take a bit getting use too .
But the picture quality is great !
and worth the wait .
