Pros:. -Terrific UI. -Compatible with Word, Excel, Powerpoint. -iWork online integration to distribute copies to PC and Mac users. -Loads of templates. -Easy drag and drop functionality. -Apple retail stores offer FREE group tutorials every week. 
Cons:. None whatsoever!. 
Summary:. I have been using iWork '09 ever since I got my new mac. It is the best office suite I have used to date. It was launched before Office 2010 and it was ages ahead of it already. The fact that I could comfortable import xls, doc, ppt and modify them, and then export them back to the doc, xls, ppt was terrific. I am the only Mac user among a class full of PC users. I needed the compatibility. It is a very intuitive suite and the drag-drop functionality is terrific. Kudos to Apple!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Many templates, can make flashy presentations. 
Cons:. cannot migrate all animations to powerpint. 
Summary:. A great program suite that is cheap and easy to use. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features, easy to use, great looking documents and presentation. Intuitive way of doing things and fantastic transitions for both professional and personal presentations. Best productivity software for Mac.. 
Cons:. Some small flaws in formatting of text boxes, lack of support for saving documents in the .docx, ,pptx etc.. 
Summary:. This product is far better than any other productivity software out there for Mac. I have used Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac and compared to iWork it is terrible. It is missing features and is not completely compatible with the PC equivalent of the product. Office is also missing key features and everything is hidden in a hundred different menus and pop up toolboxes. While iWork is intuitive with its great features and high quality looking documents and presentations, Office for Mac is years behind Office 2007 for PC. Buy iWork, its the best choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Hugely flexible and creative. Might push Microsoft Word and Excel teams to make some real improvements in order to compete - then the benefits will continue to flow to all users, even though for Windows, it will be stuck at trickle-down level.. 
Cons:. iWork is just not widely enough used yet, but that will change.. 
Summary:. 20 yrs ago I championed Word on Mac over Wordperfect. It served me well for many years, but now Pages outshines Word immeasurably. Same goes for Numbers vs Excel. The first issue at stake is to invest the time to learn new ways of working - that's entirely within your control.. The second issue is that the Windows world doesn't use iWork which unfortunately is not within your control. However iWork files convert well to their Windows counterparts, yielding even better-looking documents than if they had been created in Word or Excel from the beginning. (But then, even sharing Word and Excel files from Mac to Windows is crippled because of the constipated constraints many Windows users are forced to live with.). 

$$;
Pros:. Pages and Keynote.. 
Cons:. Numbers still needs some work.. No thesaurus (but can use Apple Dictionary).. 
Summary:. For university, I have now replaced MS Word and Powerpoint with i'Work Pages and Keynote. Most notably, Keynote is far superior to Powerpoint, and regularly makes my presentations stand out a little from the rest of the class. Pages is faster and easier to use, and I can just exported to PDF to send/print for the professors. Can always export to MS format if I wanted to. Numbers still needs some work for me to consider it as a replacement for Excel, but it's well on its way. Great stuff!. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. Easy to use. 2. Looks Great. 3. Create good looking documents. 4. Works a lot better with a Mac than Office 2008. 5. THE BEST THING IS THE PRICE!!. 6. Compatibility and the range files you can export.. 
Cons:. Somethings you can do in iWork won't work properly with MS Office e.g. Magic Move. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive, easy to learn, excellent handling of graphics. 
Cons:. Weak support for Website designers, no html support. 
Summary:. I switched to iWork from Mac Office some three years ago, and once I realized there would be no problems sharing documents with MS Office users I have never looked back. I liked MS Office, but it was unnecessarily complex where it didn't need to be, and it was at times buggy. iWork is very stable (?It just works?) and refreshingly intuitive. I quickly learn to carry out complex formatting and document creation tasks in a refreshingly easy manner. Keynote is a lot of fun to use, and is at least as powerful as Powerpoint, if not more so because of the Mac's unexcelled graphics abilities.. For those still concerned about letting go of Office, I can without hesitation recommend taking the step both in terms of productivity improvements and because of the cheaper costs in keeping up with new versions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keynote runs circles around PowerPoint. Pages is the best graphic layout application I've used (different class from InDesign entirely). I use it mainly for marketing posters and MS Word is no match. The "instant alpha" feature is a Godsend.. 
Cons:. No major cons, although I would like to see a more conservative resume template. The ones included are still to flamboyant for professional-type careers, and there is often too much white space on the page.. 
Summary:. I have no idea what CNET's Jason Parker was thinking when he criticized iWork for lack of a "business-grade e-mail client." No one is really asking for that, and it's a totally unnecessary feature. Mail.app is perfect; if bloated is your think, go with Entourage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very useful, userfriendly. Good integration with OS and other Apple software. 
Cons:. Please add support for Google applications like spreadsheets etc. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple easy to use apps pages, keynote, Numbers doesn't require a lot of learning to get the most out of the suite. 
Cons:. None that I can think of. 
Summary:. I've used IWork '08 and 09 is deferentially worth the money to upgrade and i've been using macs since 2006 so I know a thing or to about apples products and this one is top notch.. 

$$;
Pros:. It works great for average users, and allows the user to make stunning presentations, documents, or spreadsheets to share with the world.. 
Cons:. The Support section is sometimes unhelpful, and it took me a while to figure out how to make a chart in Numbers.. 
Summary:. Stability 5. Ease of Use 3. Functionality 4. Appearance 5. Compatibility 4. Total Average 4.2. This software, is great for the average user. keynote has thus far proven to be a better presentation application than PowerPoint, because of it's elegant 3D transitions. I would say however that Apple make some sort of Wizard in the chart making process in numbers. It took me a while to figure out how to make one. In the long run I would say that I would recommend this software to those whom wish to get things done with little hassle. I would also recommend this over Microsoft Office for most people.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice templates, easy to share with iwork.com, good user interface.. 
Cons:. No issues till now but it takes more time to startup.. 
Summary:. Overall, i would recommend it. Its is better than MS Office 2008.. 

$$;
Pros:. A ton of great new features, some new templates, and full screen, which i use every day, make this a great alternative to the Microsoft Office Suite for Mac.It is also almost half the price!!!! (neat visual fade in/out effects make it even better!). 
Cons:. seems to take a little longer to start up then the old 2008 version. 
Summary:. Wonderful, and totally agree with my one line summary!. 

$$;
Pros:. All the power most users will ever need. Keynote beats Power Point hands down. 
Cons:. Some of the formatting doesn't port well to MS Office. 
Summary:. For the price you'll be hard pressed to find a better suite to use for the Mac. It's quick to open, full of features and solid in operation. I'm not a heavy spreadsheet user, but Pages and Keynote absolutely are worth the money, and Keynote is a dream to use. The review stated that MS Word has better layout features, but I don't see it. In fact, I do better with Pages than Word in the layout.. If you don't have to have Word/Excel you owe it to yourself to try it out. The only reason I didn't give it a solid 5 star is some trouble I had porting some documents over - not all the formatting transferred as well as I would have liked. Other than that, no problem and worth the money for a native Mac program.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just similar enough to MS Office to make for a smooth transition from one to the other. Many more templates than MS Office. Nice looking, smooth graphics. "Inspector" in each of the programs makes for simple and precise corrections and edits.. 
Cons:. Would love to see an auto-save feature. A few small bug fixes here and there for the first version are needed.. 
Summary:. Overall, iWork '09 is one of the best office clients I have ever encountered. It is simple and familiar for even the computer-shy. Runs logically; If you would like to drag and drop something, or resize something to exactly the size of the item above it, there are actions in place assisting you with all of this. If any program can read your mind and give you what you want... it's iWork '09.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keynote.... 
Cons:. Microsoft office options. 
Summary:. I think that iWork its a great product... specially Keynote, its outstading. The integration for exporting to PDF and images, etc etc its awesome, but it needs to be tuned. For example the shapes, table options, diagrams and other easy quick stuff of the Microsoft Office for Mac.. Please do a better version with more improvements soon... Microsoft Office 2010 its coming for mac and so far it looks outstading.. 

$$;
Pros:. Have used Microsoft Office for years, and think this software is much superior.. 
Cons:. Excel compatibility could use a little work.. 
Summary:. Great business software for the Mac.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and comprehensive suite with improved integration. 
Cons:. Professional users will want a compare documents feature for Pages similar to Word. 
Summary:. Has caught up with Office in many respects but not yet all, especially more sophisticated functions a pro user will want.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's very intuitive, easy to use, and I personally prefer iWork to MS Office. (OK I admit it a fanboy since the 90's). 
Cons:. Am never going to use iWork for work until I can open Word and Excel documents, edit, save and then send on to clients without any one being aware that I am not using a MS product.. 
Summary:. At this time MSWord and MSExel are the defacto standard in my industry. Until iWork allows seamless integration to MS Office in a corporate environment, I cant use it. Could use it at home, but why have twice the number of programmes and formats to use?. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy interface, many convenient and beautiful templates. 
Cons:. No auto save feature, simply pressing a key can ruin everything, no advanced options -- you're stuck with what Apple gives you. 
Summary:. Coming from Microsoft Office, I have to say... MS Office is better.. MS gives you more options, even if it takes a little more time and is a little harder to use. With MS it's easier to paste stuff from webpages and make something truly original. With Keynote you're stuck with Apple's silly templates.. Numbers is, pretty much, Excel. I haven't really noticed a big difference.. I absolutely hate Pages.. First of all, MS Word, believe it or not, is MUCH more user friendly. Unlike Apple, right? But, anyway, that's not my real gripe about it.. Coming from MS, when I was changing the font size, I figured you could just type in a number and change the font to that. Wrong. If you type anything with that little window open, it deletes your entire document. I lost a five page essay doing this while scaling down the font size to make it actually fit into five pages. Thanks to Pages, I had to re-write a five page report. Thanks, Apple.. I'll pay the extra $50 for MS office next time.. 

$$;
Pros:. The hype sounds nice but can't really tell what it does BETTER than iWork '08. We don't have a review like MaximumPC that get into the nitty gritty and rates numerically from 1-10. Every mag and reviewer are sales types.. 
Cons:. Seems more of an upgrade than a new app. One year old '08 shouldn't need a replacement.. 
Summary:. Nothing to add to the above. Really try to maintain loyalty and appreciation for Apple products but this sort of thing is pretty questionanle.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, excellent MS Office 2007 compatibility. 
Cons:. Need many more complex features.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tries to do the work of a office system. 
Cons:. "Tries" to do the work of a office system. 

$$;
Pros:. Pages templates, Numbers number crunching and Keynote updates are very good and well worth a look.. Keynote is still the one to beat.. 
Cons:. Poor handling of tables, line numbering as well as word/excel compatibility and auto save issues still make Pages and Numbers the second choice when it comes to word processing and spreadsheets. Although the gap is closing fast.. 
Summary:. Why is line numbering such a pain in the neck?. Nearly there but not quite.. 

$$;
Pros:. Like the Numbers program better than Excel, but cannot save in program readable by both Numbers and Excel which we still have on our PC machines. Like Word better than Pages. Like Keynote just fine.. 
Cons:. We have used used PCs for many years, &#38; are migrating to MACs. However we still have PCs in house and a lot of files generated in Microsoft Office. We can read them fine, but cannot save in a file that can still be read by PCs. MACs read them fine.. 
Summary:. Fix the Office/iWork compatibility and I am sold. Until that time, we will use Office for Mac only because we have not fully migrated over to MACs yet. We still have 2 PCs in the house and a lot of files for which we need access on both MACs and PCs.. 

$$;
Pros:. ok for a fun and games machine. 
Cons:. can't sync with hand held device. 

$$;
Pros:. Pages will translate Word documents with fair accuracy, although some formatting is not translated perfectly. Pages will easily produce a PDF formatted document.. 
Cons:. After using AppleWorks with great satisfaction for years for word processing, spread sheets, and data bases, I find Pages and Numbers complex and very difficult to learn.These programs do things "for me" that I didn't ask for and find hard to undo.. 
Summary:. I have liked and used AppleWorks for years, but Mac OS 10.5 regrettable causes occasional "quirkiness" in AppleWorks. In comparison to AppleWorks, I dislike Pages and Numbers because the programs are needlessly complex and difficult to learn. (I don't use Keynotes.) I've bought three books to seek help, but it's not ben worth the trouble. The highly-touted templates offer me almost nothing since I don't want to do what the templates allegedly make easy. There is no database in iWorks even though one can try to make Numbers serve. But why? The programs do things "for me" that I don't want to do?but it's hard to undo them. I have stopped using iWorks and have switched to NeoOffice. I find the latter easy to learn and easy to use. And the price is only a voluntary donation of any amount.. 

$$;
Pros:. imaginative. 
Cons:. cannot use because instructions are unintelligible. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing that I can think of.. 
Cons:. Did not accept all macros and formatting from Windows based Office. Don't buy this thinking you will be able to bring in Excel spreadsheets and Word docs home to work.. 
Summary:. Did some really strange stuff with my documents and I stopped using it after about 15 minutes. Sure, I could have spent more time but I had work to do. So, believe it or not, I fell back onto Google Docs, which is better and free. If you require a standalone package that is free then I suggest Open Office.. Ultimately, MS Office for Mac is the way to go. iWorks really is not worth it for a working professional. If you originate your stuff from iWorks or are a student writing from scratch. Maybe. But, why buy this when you can get OpenOffice for free?.
