sufficiently sensitive touch screen

> better screen touch sensitivity

the home screen shows four options :

screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .

3 inches screen and steady performance .

also, push every icon on every screen you see .

3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .

screen size is good and i didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' i wouldn't use .

> more responsive that my old 760  , plus a better looking screen

> same screen size as the other 4 .

3 love the touch screen technology

,  its a touch screen and a 4 .

the screen is large so that it is easily read while you're driving .

the screen is big enough to view maps, street names, etc easily .

when attached to the pc, the screen just indicates the connection .

i had a nuvi 205 and i really liked it but i wanted a bigger screen .

the wide screen and spoken street names are a must .

on the 750 the zoom buttons are on opposite sides of the screen .

i can even see the screen without my reading glasses .

the background of the screen turns black when it's nighttime .
