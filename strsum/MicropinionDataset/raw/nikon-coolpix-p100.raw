Pros:. Optical Zoom 26x. 
Cons:. No shutter speed. 
Summary:. Looking at its price, design and features it is a great cam to buy!!. Updated. on Aug 24, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The pros are that the images are very high quality. They came out very good on my computer. I love the HD videos! There are a ton of features to this camera. I recommended this camera for professional photographers!. 
Cons:. The only con is that there is a lot of background noise on videos. A lot of times, the camera will have a pop-up saying there us a kens cap problem. If that happens, take out the battery and then place it back in. It should work fine then.. 
Summary:. This camera is good for people who are on a budget and who don't want to go buy a very high-tech DSLR . This camera is very professional. It is good for taking photos all the way from a simple portrait to a very interesting night landscape photo. I also want to point out one more pro. I love the fact that you don't have go out to the store and have to but AA batteries. I love the rechargeable batteries. This a good camera for starters and experts!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy accessibility to buttons. Feels like a dSLR, but you don't have to spend the dSLR price. Very fun camera, makes you feel like a professional.. 
Cons:. Don't know enough about cameras to really give this negative feedback.. 
Summary:. I bought this camera because my wife and I are traveling to Italy and have been pretty dissatisfied with our Canon ELPH 6.0 megapixel. Basically, the camera at low light settings came out horrible. We stumbled upon the P100 and instantly felt like we had to have it for our trip. Since owning the camera, I have been playing with all of the settings, read the manual, and have been experimenting with close-up and far away shots. I have to admit that I have been really satisfied with this camera, and don't understand why people have been giving this camera poor reviews based on the photo quality. I understand that photo quality is a huge deal, but if you are going to be a stickler about photo quality then you should have forked over the extra $200 and got yourself a dSLR (a mediocre one at best), and have fun spending another $2-300 for a lens that gives you a long zoom.. I would definitely recommend this camera who is wanting a solid camera that will take a great photograph in any situation, without having to spend a ton of money.. 

$$;
Pros:. 26x optical zoom wide, full hd movie, 10.3 mega pixels,. display screen desire to move. there are plenty of features to use. function is very easy. anybody can use this. very awesome.. 
Cons:. nothing to tell about on this line. coz this p100 is worth for money.. 
Summary:. 21/4/2010 i bought this and I'm very happy. coz i got a nice camera Nikon p100 :-) . before i bought this i read so many reviews about this product. ppl are giving good reviews for this product. and u see this camera its very sexy look. if u have this in your hand u got a very rich look on you. and this is my fist time i bought this zoom camera. i'm very happy .. and the price is $422. its worth.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, extremely fast and acurate focussing. Brilliant high speed shots.. Excellent battery life, I average 400 photos from half the battery (using viewfinder only). Brilliant, clear &#38; detailed viewfinder display.. Huge LCD good quality. 
Cons:. Dont like the charge times and the fact it is done whilst battery inside the camera, making it expensive to add another battery as for convenience you would want an external charger.. 
Summary:. In my opinion this camera is an extremely smooth, easy to use with heaps of optional functions.. The zoom is amazing and extremely accurate. 

$$;
Pros:. Feels like an easy-to-use DSLR, Great features for a hobbyist and a point-and-shoot alike, Can find light in any situation. 
Cons:. White balance is off on some photos, Weight. 
Summary:. I am a hobbyist who broke her DSLR and wanted a cheaper replacement. I am very impressed with the quality of photos it takes. I know you get what you pay for, and this is no exception. If you want something nicer, go all out (and pay the money for it), but if you just want a great camera that takes great, detailed images, this is it. I did not expect to be this happy with a downgrade from Nikon's higher-priced cameras. Thank you Nikon.. 

$$;
Pros:. shutter speed, photo quality, size of camera, autofocus, 3 inch screen, Microsoft software, ease of use, nightshots, easy startup instructions. 
Cons:. plastic case, no photo editing or raw files, limited flash. 
Summary:. good overall camera if you are not a camera buff. it works for me. however if you drop this thing it does seem to be to me not as strong as some.. 

$$;
Pros:. Weight--speed of capture~zoom~variable position lcd screen OR viewfinder overcomes problems composing your photo~performance in low light situations~incredible range of shooting modes~panorama assist-smart portrait technology~sport (burst) feature. 
Cons:. Can't capture camera raw &#38; no hotshoe. I will always have my Nikon D200 SLR at the ready, but this little puppy sometimes outperforms it. I have NOT used the movie capture feature yet, but am impressed with all other attributes of the Nikon P100.. 
Summary:. The extreme light weight of the camera challenges the photographer's ability to hold the camera still. The vibration reduction feature, however, is superb and I have turned out very few unusable images due to camera shake. I like using the fine settings, and have been pleased with the flexibility and the ease of use of the P100. The new mirrorless capture technology is incredible in this camera. I bought this camera for someone else ---but kept it for myself when I saw how it rivaled other cameras I have. I love it!. 

$$;
Pros:. The 26x zoom and Vibration Reduction in my opinion are the best features on this camera. I got some really great shots that I would have not otherwise been able to get with lower zooms. The folding LCD screen comes in handy for taking high/low shots.. 
Cons:. Doesn't happen very often but the camera has frozen up a few times to the point where you have to take the battery out. HD-Video does not use the optical stabilization so its hard to get non-jerky video at 26x zoom unless you have a sturdy tripod.. 
Summary:. Just took this camera with me on a Mediterranean cruise to Spain, France, and Italy and got some really nice shots with minimum hassle. The optical stabilization works great for photos and the scene settings seem to work well. I haven't played with the manual settings but they are there if I ever feel adventurous :) I was able to get sharp shots in good light at full optical zoom with no tripod. The 26x zoom makes all the difference when trying to get that small detail. It does a fairly decent job with the HD video as long as you don't expect to be able to use the full zoom range without a tripod.. Some photos (mostly low-light ones) look a bit grainy at 100% size, tho good at around 80% so if you consider this an 8MP camera, then it does an excellent job.. Overall, this is a solid camera. I really like the pics I'm able to get with the big zoom and I'm able to overlook the rare annoyance for this.. 

$$;
Pros:. LOVE the macro setting. I have been obsessed with the minutia of my backyard but unable to capture it before-I took a pic of a 2 ml bug on a peony bud &#38; when zoomed in he is perfectly clear &#38; you can see the detail of pollen all over him - gorgeo. 
Cons:. The zoom - it is just not as clear a pic as I had hoped for, having a Rebel, I had high expectations for it, but still love the camera! And the sports setting, the number of frames cuts down quite a bit on the quality of each frame.. 
Summary:. GET IT! It is no bigger in size than my Canon Powershot (that I still adore) but much lighter than it. I am a mom of fast moving children, avid but amateur photographer and family archivist and historian, so I need a camera on me at all times. Besides, I've purchased all of my hand bags for the last five years based on fitting my "stuff" and my camera. Once you've had a Canon Powershot and enjoyed the speed of capture, the quality of the pictures, you can't go backwards to the small pocket sized camera's. They just don't provide the same joy. Now having moved to this Nikon, well, that cemented it. My handbags will continue to be large and utilitarian because this camera is worth carrying around for every and all "Nikon Moment" that presents itself. The zoom was not as good as I expected, but I expect too much, it is certainly an awesome zoom and with it I captured a Baltimore Oriole that I have sat in my backyard for three years trying to get a shot of and never could, as I was lacking zoom, Powershot, Rebel, and all. I have a thing for photographing the moon. My Powershot took awesome pics of it, you could see all the divits in it, enough that I wondered if NASA knew about that camera. The zoom on this Nikon got in so close that the entire moon didn't even fit in the very large screen on the camera - and you can see clearly both spots where meteors hit the moon, the Powershot only captured one - this camera is AWESOME!!!! I wouldn't be able to obtain the macro shots that I've gotten with the Nikon if using my Rebel without buying addt'l and costly lenses. When my husband gave me the Nikon Coolpix P100 for Mothers Day I thought he was crazy. Now I praise him for it! It was worth every penny.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feels great in the hands and everything falls ergonomically into place. You HAVE to have an electric viewfinder for the 26X zoom (which coupled with the digital on top is awesome).For the best picture quality get into the settings and pick "fine".. 
Cons:. I had a Lumix ZS before and liked the portability but I will get used to this size. Could always use my Iphone in a pinch.. 
Summary:. For $399.00 (or a little less) it offers flexibility in this compact package which if you had a separate body and the lenses needed to shoot the variety of shots offered by the P100, you would need a lot more cash but a huge bag to carry it all. Picture quality of course is not like the big boys but I am not at all disappointed after "fine" tuning the menu. Great product with 1080p movie-making ability.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is very easy to use and it's operating software are good enough.. 
Cons:. its weight is very high to carry with it.. 
Summary:. Overall it's an excellent product. http://www.smallhome.com. 

$$;
Pros:. Very, very powerful in low light conditions and full HD video.. 
Cons:. The sticky side is the image quality. For a camera of its kind, I'd expect some more.. 
Summary:. If you are interested in pictures quality, maybe you should think it again, but if not, go ahead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, no need to change lences et very nice display, options and awesome pictures (for that price) you can charge your battery connecting your camera to your computer. 
Cons:. nothing bad to say for now!. 
Summary:. good deal price/quality. 

$$;
Pros:. The zoom is quite good and quick and the camera is quite easy to carry and use. Easy to grip and has a large LCD.. 
Cons:. Cannot take clear and sharp photos despite trying many settings. The battery takes more than 3 hours to fully charge and the SD HC card is only a 4 gb (4) and not (6).. 
Summary:. I must start by saying that I do not know how to take good photos and the P 100 seemed a good way to learn before I took the plunge to an expensive SLR. Unfortunately I have tried and tried but cannot take consistent good quality photos. The automatic setting is to say the least pitiful and photos taken with the Scene menu are very poor indeed. I have taken the same photo with the P 100 and my 7 years old Fujifiml F 700 and I have to say that despite the same settings the old camera is far superior to the P 100. Having spend more that 500 Aus$ in China (I have to live here for a few years) i feel that the name Nikon has lost some of his shine with this product. After having read many glowing reviews I start to think that maybe is my inexperience and will try to learn more about photography.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent in: - design, zooming, low light capturing, picture quality, speed shooting, HD1080 video recording. 
Cons:. Sound recording is BAD. There is a loud big noise like wishsh.. in the sound recording even when recording in a quiet room and using the wind noise reduction that this camera offers.I exchanged the camera by another one but the problem seems general. 
Summary:. I can?t be happy with this sound problem so this camera model is not mine. Finally, I returend two of this camera model.. 

$$;
Pros:. 26x zoom in is great, the features and function is almost DSLR. Advantage for user to go more advance in photography.. 
Cons:. Poor image quality, the results is not as per expected [as per spec].. 
Summary:. I bought this camera. I used it for several trip in the period of 2 months only. Found that it's totally unsatisfied. Due to the size, storage and portability, also the performance, I've decided to buy a DSLR. Then bought Cxxxx Rxxxx x2x. It is much defferent feelings. At the moment, I am still very happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. wide lens. 
Cons:. overexposure - colour aberation, in all default settings, resulting in pour quality images. 

$$;
Pros:. Zoom length is nice.. 
Cons:. Photo quality poor, also the image in the view finder goes black for about 2 seconds when you hit the record button.. 
Summary:. Because of the 26X zoom, I wanted to use it to replace my Panasonic FZ28 &#38; FZ35 which I use primarily for video due to you can't find over 18X zoom on an HD video camera. Also the overall length of video camera make it hard to zoom on fast moving objects, you get a fish tail effect. After trying the camera I found that the photo quality wasn't good. It also has an electronic view finder which works well on my panasonic, however with the P100 when you hit the video record button the image in the viewfinder goes black for at least 2 seconds. When you are trying to video fast moving objects once the picture comes back on in the viewfinder that object has moved and you can no longer see it in the viewfinder. This doesn't happen with the Panasonic camera which only has a 18X zoom and 720p video, but the photo quality is better.. 

$$;
Pros:. good zoom, options, light weight for the most part (compared to another I was looking at),. 
Cons:. Havent masted taking shoots while the lighting is bad, LOCKING UP. 
Summary:. Im still playing with this camera, but for the price I paid I didnt expect to have problems with it within the very short time I had it. I had it only a few hours and had it lock up on me 3x needless to say Im not happy. I will be taking it back, but first I need to try it out at the local ice hockey rink to see the quality that I can get since that is the reason Im moving up to a bigger camera campared to my little kodak. If it does what I want it to do there then I will just exchange and try it out again and if not its going back for good.. 

$$;
Pros:. Camera has many setting; lightweight; good wide angle; good landscape pictures. 
Cons:. The camera locked up 4 times when I used the camera for the first time. As a result the camera would not take a picture nor would it shut off. Eventually shut off but after using it again in the zoom mode would lock up again.. 
Summary:. I have returned the camera. Very unreliable. The zoom although large should not become fixed when used. The zoom locked 4 time when I used the camera on the first day. This was in taking about 160 pictures. I also did not like how soft the pictures were when I reviewed them later. I had high hopes when I bought the camera because it had many features that I wanted. I also did not like the fact that you had to charge the battery unless you bought a seperate charger that did not come with the camera. The battery took about 3 hrs to charge. The flap that you lift to charge the camera is very flimsy and I am sure will not hold up and it will seperate from the camera body. Returned the camera after 3 days.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good grip, large screen, decent viewfinder, familiar controls, looks real pretty. Too bad it doesn't take very good pictures. Oh yes, the big screen tilts very nicely.. 
Cons:. Basically, it takes terrible pictures. Unfortunately that's what I bought it for in the first place.. 
Summary:. I have a suspicion that someone got the decimal place on the megapixel rating wrong. The images resemble my dirst digital with 1.3 megapixels and awful pink fringing on the skintones. Color Temp is way off, especially with flash. Images lack detail as a result. Surely the delay between pressing the shutter button and the actual exposure does not have to be so long. Maybe Nikon has found a way to recycle the guts of very old cameras or has found a stash of old CCDs that they want to get rid of. My Kodak 6490 is looking pretty good right now. Too bad I can't return this thing. I didn't realize that the name Nikon no longer means anything close to quality and integrity. For pity sakes, get the 10.3 megapixels off the camera and advertising. A Nikon is supposed to be able to take very good pictures. Bottom Line: a camera should first and foremost be engineered to record acceptable images. In spite of all the cool features this camera is supposed to possess, picture-taking is not one of its attributes. PS I have been using Nikons since 1973 and presently own two D200's. Compared to my wife's Kodak 6490, the Nikon Coolpix P100 is an overpriced piece of junk. Sorry, but I cannot get over what a sham this camers is.... 

$$;
Pros:. The ability to Zoom 26x, nice optical veiwer, decent sized screen, great hand grip, takes SDHC cards. 
Cons:. The zoom freezes, poor picture quality on SO many of the shots. Not reliable, VERY poor quality control, loud zoom-when it worked.. 
Summary:. I tried this camera twice. First one froze in full zoom and I had to remove and re put in the battery and then it SLOWLY shut down. Sometimes the buttons wouldn't respond. So I returned it and tried another on. That one would sometimes not zoom at all, or would take off and zoom all the way out AND the bar would indicate it was even in digital zoom as well. The on off button would not respond worth a darn. Those pics , when I could get it to work, looked slightly orange. NO I was not willing to 'play' with the settings. At that point I had had the camera less than one day. WHAT THE %#^ is up with Nikon and the P series? I am extremely dissapointed and DONE with that line...possibly Nikon, for quite awhile.. 

$$;
Pros:. looks video quality is much better.. 
Cons:. In this column there is too much to say.. Firstly there is lots of background noise in video so taking video is worthless. zoom locks. picture quality is not as per expectation. While playing video on laptop there is too much jurks. 
Summary:. there is no good words to say for this coolpix P100 camera.taking video is of no use as too much back ground noise.I spent too much money on this camera but in reply got a BIG 0.
