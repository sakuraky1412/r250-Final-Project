i used a file retrieval program to get back all my files and pictures which i is afraid is totally gone when it crashed as i had scanned thousands of pictures that are totally irreplaceable from my childhood till to date , that would have been gone forever  .

however i did retrieve everything  .

i reformatted my drive again after the retrieval and i have had no problems with it since , (knock on wood) for the past 7 months  .

however being an older person i have learned that to buy anything today is taking a chance as no matter how far we have come to in advancements , the quality of todays mass produced products are a roll of the dice at best  .

products are not made to last as they were in my era as everything depends on sales , sales , sales , money , money , money , greed , greed , greed  .

it is not about the consumer it is all about the almighty dollar and how quickly and how much the corporations can make it however the demand is great and people are to quick to purchase without doing their homework so i guess we are just as guilty  .

remember in life , you get what you pay for and buyer beware  .

if this is done there would be less crying about how you were taken you let yourselves be taken .

this a good product  .

it is simple , not a big space hog , and large amount of space to save your information  .

do not move it a lot or it can cause hardware failure ( i did and i had to send it in for an exchange)  .

i cannot speak to the seagates    have not owned one  .

but i would , i do , and i am recommending the western digital to friends and family  .

retired programmer/analyst  .

i have had this drive for several months now and i have not had any problems at all  .

it is a great simple plug and play drive for anyone that needs additional storage  .

i have it plugged into a battery backup in case of power failure  .

i never have any issue transferring or accessing data even after long periods of not using it  .

overall great drive .

over the last year , i've purchased ten of these units  .

each and every one of them worked great out    of    the    box  .

i've so far used these drives on a dell optiplex with built    in usb 2  .

0 , as well as a dell optiplex with an adaptec usb 2  .

0 pci card i don't understand why some people have problems with this drive  .

some tips i'll offer   1) don't use usb hard drives off a usb hub  .

hard drives need as much power and bandwidth off the usb bus as possible  .

2) format the drive to either fat32 or ntfs before use  .

even if the drive comes pre    formatted , format it anyway  .

3) make sure the drive is connected to a usb 2  .

0 port  .

hard drives connected to a usb 1  .

x port simply does not work .

i have recently set up a windows home server (rc1) on an old computer of mine  .

with this easy to use software i can connect all of my computers to it and have complete back ups made in a snap  .

microsoft did a good job here  .

all i had to do is plug the drive in and the home server set everything else up  .

if i need more storage i just simply add another one  .

its cheap , sleek , cool (tempreture wise) and to this point in time stable  .

i have no real need for high speed since i am operating most of my computers over wifi .

this drive has performed outstandingly since attaching it to both my server and also swapping onto my laptops  .

all computers have acknowledged the drive immediately and has given no failures  .

the speed of the drive is consistent and exceedingly fast , through a usb 2  .

0 interface  .

the drive is backwards compatible to usb 1 but always double check that your usb is enhanced (2  .

0) otherwise the best suggestion is to install a nominal 2  .

0 add    on card  .

most problems arise from this oversight  .

best buy ran this drive for over $100 off it's regular price which brought down to $190 it's an outstanding drive and an outstanding deal  .

it's extermely quiet both horizontal and vertical , venting heat efficiently .

first thing i did is to reformat it into ntfs so that it could hold large files    since then i have not had to do a thing with it .

works   very fast and its nice looking  .

if you're smart you would know it's best to format it to hfs+ if you're using a mac  .

it boosts the speed by a lot .

i have owned my 500gb wd for some time now as far as i am concerned , it is well worth the money i suppose it depends upon what you expect and or use an external hard drive for , as to whether you would be satisfied with this drive for me it rates 10 out of 10 , excellent .

after using this hard drive for a few days it works great  .

i backup my xp then put it on my vista up loaded my vids photos to it  .

interface easy to use  .

though slow , i am happy with my purchase  .

it has 30 day trail auto backup which works perfectly  .

gladly pay small fee  .

turn pc on it works silently in the background .

i download/upload a ton of items directly to/from these drives and they work flawlessly  .

those comments stating that they didn't work or failed are most likely due to the users inability to plug it in because that is about how simple it is to use  .

i reformatted my drives from fat32 to ntfs before using them which is recommended for drives of this size  .

you cannot go wrong with this drive  .

i wo not be able to buy many more since i'm running out of usb ports  .

note that the way western digital calculates disk space results in these being 465 gb drives  .

there are lawsuits against them for not disclosing this up front to buyers , however , that has not stopped me from purchasing them since they work great and still provide a ton of disk space for the money  .

best buy just had these on sale last weekend 6/16/2007 for $129 .

this is just a big external hard drive  .

it does what it says  .

500 gb of extra room  .

even though it is usb , i do not find it to be all that slow and i am a very impatient person  .

it is extremely easy to install  .

i just plugged it in and then started using it  .

i love it .

i like the way it looks  .

it doesn't require any attachments to stand vertically  .

it works flawlessly with vista  .

i would have given 10 out of 10 but there is 1 thing i did not like about this device ; it turns on by itself when the pc is turned on  .

it would be better if this is optional .

the first thing i did upon recieving my my book is to remove the wd junk software that is included  .

i hate storage devices that come with software and the wd    my book cleaned up nicely  .

i have been using this device for months now and i have 288 gb of data stored on it without issue  .

after clearing off the included software , the next thing i did is to transfer approx  .

160gb of data  .

data transfer went smoothly and the device did not become excessively hot as others often do  .

i travel with the my book quite often and have dropped it on several occasions , yet it continues to perform  .

my only complaint would be that even when the power button is pressed to turn it off , the device tends to turn itself back on  .

i can confidently say that the wd    my book is one of the best computer hardware purchases i've ever made .

i've had the drive for a little over a week and am very impressed by it  .

it is sleek , worked like a charm via plug n play and massive while it is true that it is a little slow when transfering large files  .

so if you are planning on moving dvd backups or anything in that size range from your local hard drive to the external hard drive often expect it to take roughly 5 minutes on the other hand i have moved all of my music files to the drive and when in itunes the seek times are amazing  .

sometimes it feels like it's playing the next song before i click next one thing i did not like about this drive is that the case is a very thin cheap plastic material and does not look as good as in the pictures (things rarely do)  .

the drive still looks good compared to others in the market today also the power button on the front is a little too easy to push or hit accidentally  .

i've had a couple instances where i've been shuffling things around on my desk and powered down the drive by accident for ~$230 it's a hell of a drive  .

would definitely recommend it .

i am very impressed with this storeage device  .

it is plug and play on my system and i modified the storeage settings by reading the online turtorial in minutes i have ripped my dvd collection to the device and have not experienced any problems  .

in fact , i am stunned by the product  .

it looks great and operates great  .

i have been watching movies over my network and cannot tell that i am watching a stored copy  .

to top it all off i purchased the drive for $199 at best buy .

i bought this drive so i can rip my cd collection to high    quality mp3 files  .

it's set up to go out of the box and comes with google's picasa , and western digital should probably look into bundling an mp3 management program (like monkey) with this drive  .

i do not like that it comes formatted with fat32 (although of course this is more compatible with various os's)  .

is not pretty much any windows user buying this using xp  .

aside from that , the drive is very fast much faster than the other external hard drives i have , including another western digital drive  .

i like the fact that it shuts itself off with the computer i got this for $133 (250gb version) at sam's club , and that's pretty good considering a bare drive that size plus a cheap enclosure will set you back nearly that much anyway .

i've owned a few external drives and this is my favorite by far  .

it's quiet , powers itself on and off (so no pesky on/off switch) , has a smaller power brick than most , looks good sitting on your desk and is fast  .

especially great as a multimedia drive (i use this with my media center edition to record tv) the only downside is that you cannot crack the case and swap drives , which is not really something most consumers will be doing anyway the essential edition is perfect for those that do not really need the glowing disk space gauge of the pro edition and like myself already have more than enough usb and firewire ports on every other device .

this hd is honestly the best external hd i have encountered  .

plug and play , it is lightning fast and almost completely silent  .

easy to use and to stow  .

i'd recommend it over any of the competition , especially seagate , which has given me way too many problems .

i purchased this to back up my remote drive  .

i do not save anything except programs to hard drive  .

worked like a charm , but has only the simplest graphical pix  .

copied tons of file like a charm .

i immediately transfered my mp3s , movies , psp games and other documents and it went smoothly  .

so far , i do not have any problems with it .

its pretty difficult finding reputable 500gb internal drives let alone a usb drive  .

to be honest i didnt really feel like putting one in my computer anyway although im sure im capable i think i got this for $139 at cc  .

is this or the seagate  .

the seagate is 159  .

i do not want to use any backup software , so i dont know if im missing anything , but this thing works right out of the box i plugged it in so i could move stuff off my full 160gb internal to do my yearly reformat its quieter than my internal drive which i love  .

one thing i hate about it though is when its connected the lime green light flashes all freaking night long , i dont really wanna electrical tape the sucker but i just might have to i changed the volume label to blackbox , that is pretty neat i had to do some research to figure out how to change the filesystem from fat32 to ntfs without reformatting worked other than no flashing status lights only think i would ask for would be a gigabit lan port and ftp server and print server and upnp media server but then i would need to pay like $200 more and i'll pass .

alright , so here i am ready to finally write my mybook review  .

at this moment i am reformatting the thing b/c it became unrecognized with my new computer  .

so am i here to flame it  .

no , but i want to inform folks of what happened so as they can hopefully avoid it  .

this drive is a good drive , it doesnt get to hot even with major transfers  .

and 1/2 a terrabyte for around $125 avg , what can you complain about  .

the transfer is fast too  .

so what happened  .

i did a new system build  .

new mobo with new drivers and unexpectedly plugged add played it onto my new system  .

i think because of the configuration , the drivers did not take , and it reformatted it on its own  .

the stuff is still there , based on scans with data recovery software , and the drive is still healthy via xp dsk management and wd diags , so i must warn , if you pull this baby off one pc onto another , or multiples , be careful and install the wd data software  .

i've read that some folks remove this stuff , and that may work with single pc setups , but beware with cross overs  .

cons  .

as someone else wrote , the thing will turn itself on every so often , and i think this is part of my reformat issue , so im gonna keep an eye on it  .

also the note pc cross over issue , be careful  .

lastly , i paid over $200 at staples , b4 meeting the supreme newegg , my fault , but even staples had it at half the price a month later , dorsnt it burn you up when this happens  .

ok win98se peeps here's the how2  .

brought to you by me    just minutes after success installing on windows 98se  .

mine is the wd 320gig essential ed 2  .

wd my book essential edition 2  .

0    win98se  .

no win98se driver  .

none on web or wd site  .

here's what i did to get it (the usb hd) to run on windows 98se  .

after pc is booted to desktop plug in usb hd  .

windows detected clicked thru the driver install unknown device  .

my computer properrties device manager    select unkown usb device  .

properties reinstall driver  .

select display a list of drivers in a specific location  .

select from list  .

select hard drive  .

select usb ( do not select usb product )  .

windows 98 message    found wd3200aaj external    installs driver  .

check my computer should see (2) new drives appear  .

reboot    done  .

the drive doesn't need to be formatted  .

it is already fat32  .

it also works plug    n    play with win2k , xp (even as a fat32)  .

no need to fomat    just dump the oem folders for more space    the reasson two drives appear instead of one is because the  .

product has an integrated raid controller which causes the  .

ghost drive to show up  .

whatever you write to one , shows up on both    if you unplug the usb hd while the pc is running drive my book  .

remains shown but is not there , and the other drive immediately  .

disappears from the system (as it should) please take note     .

any subsequent attempted read/write to the removed usb hd  .

will blue screen ya  .

may be best to power down before removal and they said it could not be done .

if it fails on you unplug it from the crowded power strip and plug it into one that does not have any thing pluged into it and you will be back up and running  .

i bought the 400gb version almost a year ago to the day  .

when it worked , it worked pretty well  .

when shutting down , you had to go into your task bar and safely remove hardware otherwise it wouldnt start up the next time without a battle  .

most importantly , there's no back    up software and mine just died within the last couple days  .

contacted support 4 days ago for some help and still havent heard from them i would encourage those looking to vear away from these units  .

they're just not stable .

i bought this drive for only $130  .

great deal for 500gb hard drive that you can carry almost anywhere  .

it did work with a windows vista laptop first time around  .

however , this drive only worked for a day or so , then started exhibiting all sorts of errors  .

at first , i thought it is a driver problem since i then connected to a machine using a form of windows server 2003  .

then , i connected it to a windows xp computer and found the same problems  .

after only three weeks i had to rma the drive through western digital  .

luckily this second drive works well  .

but only a couple of weeks is not long enough to tell whether something will last when you get the drive , you will have to format it to ntfs since it comes formatted as fat32 which only win '98 and me recognize properly updated  .

on mar 14 , 2010  .

i was not expecting a box full of awesome but this thing is seriously bare bones  .

it's also fat32 which i neglected to notice  .

easy fix , just format it  .

it's incredibly cheap feeling  .

i've seen mcdonald's toys made of higher quality plastic  .

fingers crossed it survives a while  .

warranty recommended .

basically the problem with the product is mine is a recepticle for an unwanted recertified disk  .

combine this with poor thermal design (no ventilation and plastic enclosure) and the results is a short expected life  .

if you buy this to serve as one of multiple backups , you might want to take a chance  .

if you want a mission critical disk pass on this .

will not replace with another wd product .

very disappointed with this product  .

the software for backup that comes with it is clunky and practically useless  .

also , we bought a couple at my office two of them didn't work  .

one would only work with usb , the firewire wouldn't work  .

the other wouldn't mount at all  .

just a junky box lighting up  .

do not buy this .

don't rely on this product  .

there are many other decent wd products , this one sucks  .

the safest place for your data (as the box implies) , is on another device  .

don't buy this one  .

wd needs to rework this product  .

the mini usb port also does not seat very well  .

it would have been nice to also see regular usb with type a and b connector and in the future e    sata  .

if you insist on the purchase , then please have a disaster plan in place to recover those beloved pics and mp3's .

i've relied on a western digital essentials drive to back up my data since november of 2007  .

last week , i backed up some old emails , and all my photographs disappeared or were corrupted  .

western digital will do nothing since the warranty has expired  .

on one level i get that       warranties expire  .

but if the warranty on a car , or a toaster , or whatever expires , you can always say , well , at least i got to use it during for a certain period of time  .

but with backup drives , nothing matters but whether the data is there today  .

now  .

and mine is gone , gone , gone  .

western digital got the money ; i lost the most important data i entrusted to them , and that is that  .

never , ever would i trust a product from this company again .

do not buy it  .

you lose so much material  .

get something else other than a western digital .

woo  .

bottom line i really would love to have some pull in this world  .

i really wish i was not just some guy sitting in my home in some city  .

i wish i could reach out and scream that i have been fooled  .

fooled by a company that says they're progressive and useful  .

nope  .

useless is my opinion of this gear again , i'm just one customer ( who is told that it's my computer that's having this slowdown problem , not the hard drive  .

um , my computer is just fine  .

ask the 150+ programs i have on it and the 5gig of ram that keeps me moving  .

or even the fact that my laptop mini hard drive outperforms this machine in every test i have tried  .

oh yeah , as i said before the customer support actually said , we do not support apple macintosh products , never stated that we did , and will not attempt to for future designs of this or any other drive  .

essentially , they said f () (k you buddy , you bought it , now live with it i'd love to live with it , if i could  .

too bad it takes 3    4 attempts to retrieve any info or files from this western digital mybook  .

wd mybook    poop  .

just my $300 worth of 2 cents garbage .

the problems are with the drive itself  .

i though it might be the controller , or something else with the enclosure , but not so   after i is no longer able to access the drive , i opened the case , took the drive out and installed it in a desktop  .

it had the same problems as in the enclosure , but i is able to copy files from the drive to another drive during the first few minutes after switching on the computer  .

so i opened the pc case and put a fan right in front of the drive and it worked  .

so there is an overheating problem  .

with enough cooling , the drive is still working and i is able to recover all my data before throwing it into the trash  .

never wd mybooks again  .

no matter how cheap  .

you do not even get what you pay for  .

first i put important business data on one of them  .

then i backed it up on another one of them  .

the third is just for music  .

the business one failed first , but because i lacked faith i is able to back up the data on another hard drive next one contained only favorite music that is backed up  .

however a lot time went into picking out that music  .

now i will tear apart the drives and see if i can re    initiate the drive in my computer and use one of them as a secondary internal drive highly recommend not buying these drives  .

i first started seeing intermittent problems with this drive about 6 months ago  .

i thought that perhaps something is overheating , so i transplanted the enclosed wd hard drive into a vantec enclosure , and everything worked ok for a while all of a sudden a few weeks ago the drive stopped being recognized , and i have had to take it in to a data recovery firm to retrieve the data  .

it will cost me about $900 cad to recover the data onto a new drive  .

it's my own fault for having no usable backup , but nonetheless , i cannot recommend this drive  .

you get what you pay for .

this drive is great up until the point where it stops working for no reason  .

i owned this drive for about 1  .

5 years 3 months of that is spent in storage  .

i used the drive very lightly and is never rough with it  .

the other day when i pulled it out to use it all the drive would do is spin up and click , and then shut down  .

put on top of this wd's horrible customer support  .

i have also had many problems with the drive losing all of the data on it before so i think its time to get a much better drive .

this unit lasted less than 24 hrs before crashing , is moving 40 gig package , when unit crashed , followed manufactures shut down procedure , unit says that unit needs to be formated , loss some files that are now nonrecoverable my wd 250 oio pocket drive works like a charm , expected the same from my book  .

is extremely excited about the low price for a 500gb drive  .

i've had the drive for a few months now  .

although drive is a little slow it seemed fine until a week ago when it is no longer recognized by windows  .

now i've lost data and by the sounds of other reviews wd is not very helpful at resolving this issue either  .

does not sound like i'm the first this has happened to either .

this drive is too good to be true       500gb external drive with a small case and a cheap price  .

the drive repeatedly malfunctioned when writing       i tried operating it using usb 2  .

0 on two different windows xp boxes as a side note , the case while wonderfully small is made of very cheap plastic and has the fit and finish of a product you'd expect to cost $20       it's odd to put a 500gb drive in a flimsy plastic case that looks like a toy unplugging power to drive and then reattaching helped a little , but this is just too risky for data  .

it's like gambling  .

it repeatedly was not recognized as a drive by the computer and had data copy and erase errors it took two hours to copy over 400gb of data and then another half hour to do an rma at buy  .

com because i could not speak to a live person at western digital or buy  .

com  .

the phone tree at both locations would require the patience of a monk to navigate over half a day i is not once able to stream video or audio using usb 2  .

0 although i could open several files i copied to the drive i is seduced by the price for this size drive , but now i have to wait to get my money back , i wasted hours copying data and i'm going to have to do it all over again  .

is it worth saving $100 or $200  .

unless you are retired and eating out of cans , spend an extra $100 or $200 and save a lot of trouble .

it does not function as marketed no updates/backups after the intial installation  .

cannot update the latest firmware and software updates .

all companies have problem products and , although i don't like the inconvenience of having to return a product , within the first hour of use , the thing died  .

knowledge base is terrible  .

wd's replacement is immediate with no questions asked  .

that's because it is only an online form  .

i did think at the time there must be something weird to have an automated return policy  .

the replacement arrived quickly but it died in the same manner within an hour  .

i've had it  .

i guess i'll go back and get a seagate even though that brand conked out on me but i got about a year out of it  .

do not buy this product  .

read all the reviews and save yourself the aggrevation .

western digital has burned the bridge for me  .

i'll stick with other brands of hard drives in the future  .

i bought 3 of these drives , all randomly loose connection and i have to unplug and plug back in to gain access  .

i cannot get one of the drives to reconnect at all , trying it on 3 different computers , both vista and xp  .

i cannot find update drivers on the wd website  .

wd is my brand of choice , never again .

it is an ok drive  .

the drive should have lasted alot longer  .

unit is out of warranty  .

wd is would not help even with the premature failure and blamed it on the low cost of the drive which offset the longer warranties they offer on others ,  .

do not buy this product  .

i'm writing this review since i want to warn others so that they can avoid the mistake i made  .

i used this product to back    up my data for 2 years  .

today , i connected it to my computer (+ two other laptops to make sure) it informed me that in order for me to use it i would had to re    format it  .

hence , all my data is lost now  .

i always make sure that i disconnect the device safely , so that cannot be the problem  .

also , see 'cons' for other problems .

it lost all my data and memories , my mac hd outlived my bu drive sad save your data and memories never buy a wd hd again  .

we bought 2 of these 10 months ago  .

the first one stopped working in the summer when it fell 4 inches (4       not 6 , not 10 , not 12 , but 4) , on to a carpeted (read soft and cushioned) floor  .

it whirrs and clicks , but doesn't show up on the pc  .

no way to fix it , best buy , of course , wouldn't touch it without a service agreement , etc  .

data lost the second one worked throughout the summer , then sat for 2 months , undisturbed , untouched , safe , and secure  .

now it is generating the following message   the disk you inserted is not readable by this computer  .

hmmm  .

and why is that  .

it's the same computer and the same drive and the same port and the same cables  .

it's even the same outlet in the wall  .

data inaccessible lost  .

before the summer , when first using the drive , the inadequate instructions led to a frustrating and costly (time and data) sequence of events  .

my book is formatted fat32 , which works with both mac and pc but only for some things  .

there are no instructions saying it needs to be reformatted for optimal use with a mac  .

problems arose when trying to transfer video via idvd  .

to solve the problem , the all previously stored data had to be backed up on another external drive , then the my book is reformatted  .

but transferring the data back is also problematic (it took a technician several days to get what she could back) and some of it is lost  .

simple instructions would have circumvented this issue if you are one of the lucky ones who have no problems with this drive , then great  .

otherwise , do not take a chance with your data       we have lost so much that we valued both personally and professionally  .

find something with a better track record , even if it is more expensive updated  .

on oct 19 , 2008  .

what else need to be said  .

just one more product that vista cannot load drivers for  .

funny thing is , my mac recognizes it with no problem .

support is impossible  .

downloads do not work and you cannot contact them by email or by phone  .

if you buy it toss it  .

i is excited when i bought this drive  .

i is upgrading from a 6 year old que 60gb drive , because my computer no longer had a firewire port , and i needed more space  .

the my book drive was not too expensive , and i could back up my data , and expand my storage space  .

however , within 2 months of having this drive , it completely failed on me  .

it still powers up  .

the computer still recognizes that something is being plugged in  .

however , the drive does not mount  .

it just does nothing  .

i cannot access it  .

when i look at it with disk management , it shows an unknown not initialized drive errors occur if i try to initialize it or format it  .

and , other hdd tools do not even recognize that it is plugged into my system  .

it is never dropped  .

nothing ever happened to it  .

it just simply quit working  .

so to make a long story short , my advice is to avoid this item at all costs  .

do not purchase  .

go for something more reliable .

i have now been burned twice by western digital's (wd) crap drives  .

i cannot believe i is stupid enough to buy a second one (essential , 500 gb) , after the 1 tb my book world edition had to be replaced twice (wd sent me a defective drive on the first replacement attempt)  .

i don't know who is designing/manufacturing/testing these door    stops , but that's about all they're good for  .

please do not make the mistake i did and buy a wd product .

half an year ago i bought an external mybook ssential 320gb (first edition)  .

it worked and still works fine , and as i need more extrenal capacity for backups and photos , i decided to buy mybook essential 500 gb (this time second edition)  .

and it is a bad mistake  .

after plug    in i got message   installing new device driver , after that no driver found  .

so i chose to search on internet , no driver found again , tried to search on system disk i got message driver found but could not be installed  .

this made me angry  .

again i tried old 320 gb , still working  .

so i tried to seatch on western digital web    and i found an article about this problem , in which author tried to persuade me to delete file infosys  .

fortunately i did not because i found later on ms web info that deleted file wonï¿½t be created again            ))) ms offers some hotfix kb 940199 , so i downloaded it , but what a surprise your system does not require this hotfix , or something like this  .

so , i really do not know what to do first    not to buy anything from western digital anymore , second uninstall vista (downgrade to old good xp )  .

does somebody have another solution  .

by te way , why old drive is working and new one needs some extra drivers  .

the longer i use vista tho longer i feel , that this product is not finished    even after sp1 installation  .

already olved problems in xp are now appearing again howgh now i am waiting if ms support and also wd support gives me some useful info if i got this drive work i will write again by until then , jan  .

the harddrive crashed after 1 year of service , anyone know how much data recovery costs  .

ok so       i bought this lovely sleek looking product caught at a great price plugged it in and away i went i had gbs and gbs of data on all kinds of media and thi slook like the perfect solution if is effortless to send files bakc and forth download went righ tot the drive it is quiet i is like a crackhead with a hidden stash the size of fort knox 265 gb later          yes fans  .

265 gigabytes later i go to plug the turn it on and                voila  .

usb cannot identify the device error  .

no problem       i have a 2nd computer       oh see usb found the device and installed except i cannot see the drive (hmm did i mention i had 265gb of mf data on this damn thing) my entire mp3 collection and family photos , movies etc etc etc so now i'm stuck with the thing that does not but make clicking sounds which i found out later meant the heads were screwed wd yea i mean western digital must be a scam company form a third world country because i cannot find them anywhere or any help for this product which i know they must've have realized this would happen hard drive recovery of my data is going to cost me a whopping $1700 to send the driv eto a clean room lab that would take this thing apart and recover the data from the disk therein so yes all i could is throw it in the garbage and find something better and rebuild if i did not say it already         western digital  .

main directory is not clean , full of some programs and klasors  .

some of this programs are just trials 2  .

slow  .

i couldn't finish my backup for hours  .

and in 2    3 weeks fat damaged and i lost all these backup hours and days of data 4  .

fat formatted  .

so my datas gone  .

while recording power got down and no any my book around  .

why ntfs is not default  .

this is backup tool  .

i saw it after transferred much data unfortunately and i didn't change 5  .

now i'm trying recover my datas  .

sure from usb it is not possible and i have to open the case  .

i must connect the hard disk to the machine directly  .

but ;  .

guaranty will go down  .

still i could not open  .

wd designers worked so hard about to make opening this case really difficult  .

they had to work hard to make the product safe for data i will open it by anyway .

thought i is getting a premiere drive from a premiere company to keep my backups on but i is mistaken  .

the first drive lasted 6 months before i had to replace it under the warranty  .

the replacement drive lasted 8 months and of course the warranty has expired  .

i wo not be replacing it with anything from western digital especially considering drives from other manufacturers have lasted me for years without a hiccup .

western digital products and company are horrible i have been back and forth on the phone with india (wester digital support) for the past month and a half  .

i purchased an elements drive which did not work they instead shipped me out a refurbished my book which did not work then they sent me another refurbished my book which is not working  .

i am left with two refurbished drives that dont work and they have my original purchased drive  .

they tried to convince me that i need to call my motherboard manufacturer mean while i have two passports that worked and installed properly on my gateway laptop  .

be aware stay away i am definetly one of the unlucky ones 3 drives in a row that dont work thats not unlucky thats bad business and bad manufacturing  .

if this issue does not get resolved i am reporting them to the better business bureau this is ridiculous  .

just understand what you are getting yourself into and this goes for most drives that they manufacture not just this my book .

i am sitting looking at the sticker that says 'works with windows vista' on the box  .

this product does not work with vista , and if i could be bothered , i'd sue western digital for a complete wasted day of stuffing around  .

there is not even a cd that comes in the box , the website is completely unhelpful , and there seem to be no resources whatsoever to get this thing going  .

the annoying thing is that i managed to see the drive for about two hours , and copied all my personal data onto it  .

now it's disappeared , and i cannot even reformat it to take it back to the shop  .

no amount of system tools will even recognise that the thing exists  .

a complete and absolute waste of money .

buyer beware i did the research and finally decided to buy a 500gb external drive only i bought the wrong one  .

there are glowing reviews at buy  .

com , dell  .

com , etc with no neg reviews posted  .

just google [ my book essential vista ] and you'll find numerous postings about this drive not being recognized by windows , or becoming unrecognizable after you've loaded valuable data on it  .

don't be fooled by the low price  .

if you get this drive and it is unrecognized by windows       there's nothing you can do to make it be recognized no drivers anywhere for vista or xp  .

just the fact that wdc  .

com does not have xp or vista drivers for download at their own website should tell you that they don't even know how to get it to work with anything more than win98se  .

furthermore cnet did not even plug in and test this essential edition before posting their review here read it yourself this is supposed to be vista    compatible , meaning i plug it in and start using it as others have reported in their glowing reviews  .

instead , i've wasted 2 hours of my saturday morning with a stupid ext hard drive that is not recognized by my (up    to    date) vista home premium there's no friggin' driver at western digital's website for downloading and installing  .

there's no cd    rom containing drivers included  .

so i'm sitting here looking at the quietest hard drive i've ever owned  .

in fact , it's about to boxed back up and returned to dell because i'm tired of dealing with it  .

fortunately , for the 2 people still using win98 se , there's a downloadable driver at www  .

wdc  .

com what a complete joke  .

you've been warned .

do not buy this drive  .

the drive worked for about 2 months then one day my computer suddenly could not locate the drivers  .

on restart , the drive could not be recognized  .

i've tried all necessary troubleshooting but the drive no longer spins , does not get warm and cannot be recognized  .

my best friend had an identical experience with the my book 250gb drive  .

western digital tech support is completely useless and will not make recommendations in data recovery  .

do not waste your money or your time with western digital drives .

worked find for a couple of days then then bamm  .

computer cannot recognize the hard drive  .

i tried calling there tech support what a joke cannot reach a live person with a pulse to talk with , the message says someone will assist you in 15 min waited for an hour and still no answer  .

i tried to email tech support but still no response  .

i will never buy another wd product  .

save your money .

after 3 failed installation attempts finally returned  .

virtually no documentation with drive , no support on website and no easy way to find drivers or software  .

installation crashed my system  .

poor product , poor support .

i bought this and is real excited to get it  .

500 drive so cheap  .

well you get what you pay for is true here  .

i unwrap it , plug it in and it worked for like 20 mins , and then it just dissapeared off my computer  .

i unplugged the usb and plugged it back in , and nothing  .

there is only one way to turn it off , the round button on the front  .

i hold it down for a year and try everything but it wont turn off  .

so i unplug it and plug it back in and finally the computer sees it  .

a few mins later again it dissapears  .

so again i unplug and replug but this time it wont even turn on  .

save your money and your hair  .

dont buy this piece of junk  .
