the second room was bigger , but not such a good shower the pool is mainly out side and was too cold to use as the pump had broken .
breakfast was very good on the saturday and sunday , freshly cooked , but on monday it seemed they were running out of fresh food our first room seemed fine until we tried to turn on the tv. .

3 years ago by chance we popped in for a meal , it was absolutely excellent even if expensive , so when an advert came through it triggered my memory and decided a good time to visit it again and to walk on the chilterns and combine it with national trust properties , previously we had concentrated on the sites of windsor .

so what was not quite right , the food was expensive , but although nothing wrong with it i do not think it warranted the price tag .

no problem we were given another room , but i do not think the room should have been let in the first place .
