i read a lot of reviews and did a ton of research on gps's  .
the 360 is incredibly user friendly , portable and the screen size is not too small  .
i have had the unit two months and paid $350  .
i love it  .
while many reviewers mentioned that you need not read the manual , i found it (on line version) to be wonderfully helpful  .
as mentioned the mounting hardware is excellent  .
i think windshield mounts work great in a rental car but are dangerous as they obscure vision  .
i had mine hard wired in my audi  .
i also had an fm modulator installed so the mp3 player and voice prompts and bluetooth phone all come through the bose stereo system in the car  .
they used the head phone jack on the nuvi to accomplish this  .
because they used the dc power supply (cigarette plug in) for the power installation i had to buy another so i can move the unit to other vehicles  .
i went to garmin's site and bought ($30) an accessory package that included dc pwr dash mt  .
great nav , music , pic viewer and portable  .
first i got tomtom gps because it is less expensive  .
good $100 less expensive  .
but , i returned tomtom very quickly after it could not find my home address and it had trouble locating other locations i pickup garmin 360 and after using it for few days i knew that the extra cost of this unit is well worth it  .
garmin 360 is very precise with directions  .
it does not have trouble with finding addresses like tomtom  .
garmin is extremely easy to use , just type an address and you are on your way  .
i really like that garmin can find different points of interest in immediate area like restaurants , grocery stores , gas stations etc  .
user can also type specific point of interest like for example wal    mart and garmin will look up all wal    mart superstores in immediate area  .
garmin has other handy features like currency converter , measurement converter and others which are very useful trawling outside your country  .
garmin is more expensive then competition but you definitely get what you paid for .
i work in sales , and my car is my office  .
i is in the market for a navigation system that needed to have a friendly interface , along with bluetooth and mp3 functionality  .
after spending months of research both on and off line , it is easy to conclude the nuvi 360 is the best of breed it essentially came down between the nuvi 360 and the tom tom go 910  .
i had the opportunity to experiment in person with both units , and the 360's interface is simply tighter , the calculations seemed faster , and touch screen is more responsive i've only had the nuvi for a little over two weeks , and i could not be more satisfied  .
i should note that i had the unit professional hard    wired into my car's cd changer input using the nuvi's 3  .
5 mm headphone jack  .
this allows the sound to come through my speakers , and all i can say is awesome  .
i also have the flexibility to connect my 30gb mp3 player , but with the nuvi 360's mp3 capabilities there's really no need  .
the interface is just so damn friendly while driving (much easier to read and select through the tracks) the bluetooth functionality is hands    down my favorite feature  .
ordering take    out on the way home from work has never been easier (or more fun)  .
simply tap food to locate restaurants within your area , then tap the phone number displayed with your desired listing and the call is made  .
no longer any need for 411 my motorola q had no problems connecting to the 360 , and all my contacts (hundreds) were easily downloaded into the nuvi's phone book making dialing calls a breeze (also makes for a great caller id)  .
people are amazed when i tell them i'm calling from the nuvi because of the call's clarity (it may help that the unit is mounted to the side of the center consel) most importantly is the navigation itself  .
great graphics , very responsive touch screen , quick calculations , and excellent info/stats (including estamted arrival time , speedometer , compass , total drive time , ability to add stops to final destination , etc) overall , i am very much more than satisfied with the nuvi 360  .
i would not recommend anything else for the money (now around $400 on most online retailers)  .
i can say without any hesitation that you will not be disappointed  .
i've only have this new gadget for about a week now  .
i'm very impressed with it so far  .
i is in phoenix , az when i bought it  .
so , i wanted to see my dad who i havent seen in over 18+ yrs  .
well , i typed in his address and it took me right to his door  .
i is impressed  .
and my dad wanted to check it out  .
so , we put it in his car and it drove us to a particular restaurant and also back to his house i'm doing a road trip for now and already done over 3 , 000 miles  .
the 360 has not dissappointed me yet  .
i've still gotta go to las vegas and a few other stops people , this 360 is perfect  .
not too high and could be lower , lol  .
u wont be dissappointed with it  .
this is a truly remarkable device  .
it is easy to use , accurate , and reasonable  .
i did hours and hours of internet research  .
this model came up over and over again  .
it is perfect for my price range  .
when i ordered , it only showed an a/c adapter , but when it came , the cigarette lighter adapter is there  .
i immediately hooked it up to my computer via usb cable and downloaded the latest update on the software  .
it could not have been easier  .
i'm truly a fan of this brand and model  .
i had had magelan gps purchased in costco , which is absolute waste i got my 360 for christmas  .
have been happy ever since  .
i travel for my business all over the country  .
so far , nuivi never let me down even once  .
smart , versatile , light , comfortable  .
just a pleasure to have i am a critic by nature , but this gps is excellent .
i've had my handy dandy nuvi 360 for 2 days and i have to say i love this product i'm pretty picky over electronic purchases and i only decided recently to take this plunge and wow i'm glad i purchased this one i is on    line 2 days researching gps units and wanted something under $500  .
00 this particular nuvi has the bluetooth and when you drive as many miles as i do i wanted something hands    free  .
it works great  .
iam so impressed with the sound and am told it sounds better thru the mic on the nuvi than the phone itself  .
the menu's are easy to use and its very accurate  .
i updated it last nite thru my laptop and it is so simple , i is expecting a mess of programs i would have to try and figure out how to do what but it was not , then i even downloaded different cars for the display car which i thought is awesome  .
nuvi has it goin on  .
i'm totally impressed  .
i'm getting ready to drive from here in mt to wv and i'll update on the performance when i get back .
i travel extensively and this new tool (xmas present) is the best thing i have ever had  .
it not only gets me to where i want to go but finds my gas , food and places i need to go and then you can call them if you wish with a push of a button (if you have bluetooth phone)  .
i can not wait to go over seas to try the translator service and converter  .
i will never travel again without it  .
recommend this to anyone , its bluetooth feature is awesome  .
bought it for my 17 year old son and he had it up and running in a ny second  .
we were blown away with the blue tooth interface , especially the display of his phone list  .
very clear display  .
i drive into very remote logging roads in se oklahoma to take nature photos and all those dirt trails were displayed  .
that really made me happy  .
everything worked as promised so well done gary and minh (garmin) .
after doing a lot of research , i decided on the nuvi 360 over everything else remotely in this price range  .
it is ready to go out of the box  .
i'm one of those guys who enjoy reading the manual , but after a few pages it became very clear that the manual is unnecessary  .
no instruction is needed to get this baby on the road and you headed in the right direction the day i got it , my wife , friends and i hit the road for a 3 hour trip to make a concert at night  .
i took no backup directions and relied entirely on the nuvi to get us to a place we had never been before  .
the 360 took us right to the front door  .
i is relieved and excited at the same time  .
the size is perfect  .
it looks compact and neat on the dash and it is not visually intrusive for the driver  .
the colors and back light is bright  .
the night time mode and the ability to dim at a user determined time is nice  .
the nuvi is easy to place in and remove from the included window mount , which i highly recommend that you do considering that this little fellow would look mighty attractive sitting in the window to passing thieves the most impressive thing so far is the poi feature  .
the list is extensive and includes food , gas , lodging and even schools  .
my wife is in education and travels all over the state to different schools so this is perfect for her  .
on the way to the concert we all wanted to stop and eat  .
my wife , who is not necessarily technologically savvy , is able to navigate the menus and pull up a list of fast food restaurants  .
we found a chick    fil    a that everyone wanted and set it as a via point  .
my friends were amazed and are now considering getting one there are a lot of other features that are both useful and fun , too many for me to go over  .
ill just say that this device is as advertised and then some  .
i highly recommend this to anyone looking to get a portable nav system .
i took it to europe and bought sd card maps for germany and turkey , worked perfectly with the sd card available from a turkish company having street level guidance even in out of the way cities  .
bluetooth useful for hands free driving in the car , mp3 and audiobook compatible  .
2 gig internal memory which handles 2009 na maps and a few audio books  .
i have one sd card with eurpean maps and a 2nd with audio books and mp3 and its worked great  .
i did get the travel case and a thin plastic screen protector separately .
one of the best ones i have seen for the price  .
highly recommend it to all .
don't want to repeat about all the great stuff that's already being said about this gem the cons maybe more of an interest to some bluetooth connection to my phones (motorola e815 and krzr)works great once setup , however , once the gps is turned off and back on , does not seem to automatically reconnect to my phone (s) , i need to rescan , find device and reconnect , etc mp3 player    works and sounds amazing  .
problem tho is that you can either play one selected song or play all songs  .
no option to select few songs or create a playlist  .
(if you know a way , please let me know)  .
last problem although not such big deal no qwerty keyboard option find it hard to type fast i paid $289 for this (with an instant rebate of $100)  .
it's the best price you will find in canada (costco  .
ca)  .
get this device , you will not be disappointed cheers and happy driving .
this is my first gps unit  .
overall im extremely satisfied w/ purchase  .
there are a few things that garmin can improve on ie  saving phone# there are no ( ) or    key  .
ive read that it can be done but you need to pull the file onto pc then convert and put back into the unit  .
seems silly a simple function  when saving address and you want to enter phone# you have to go back to favorites list and edit from there  ne one noticed that when you save a locate and view the map there seems to be 2 names on top of each other  editing names/number/info , there is no backspacing  .
you can only delete 1 character at a time or hold down to delete entire these are minor issue that i hope garmin can fix with their updates  .
other than that is unit is perfect for me  .
size , portability , and user friendly is what i like .
waited for a great price , and got one at costco for $ 250  .
00 love how the docking on the windshield works  .
the hard wire connects to the docking station  .
so you do not have to  .
disconnect the unit from the gps every time you bring it with you  .
taking it on and off the windshield mount is very easy i looked up my phone on the garmin site , to see if it was  .
compatible with the bluetooth  .
i didn't see it listed i called garmin customer service , which is based in the usa  .
i talked with jeff , very pleasant and professional  .
he asked me what my phone model was , and looked it up  .
he said he thought it would work  .
he asked if i wanted to link it up , while i is talking with him  .
of course i said yes  .
one minute later my phone is talking with my 360 nuvi  .
he then put me on hold , called me with his own cell phone , and it worked great  .
he stated that all the phones have not been tested , but they had over 325 phones that  .
worked with the nuvi  .
mine will not be fully functional ,  .
but it does what it's intended to do , hands free calling and receiving  .
my phone book did not copy over his suggestion is to take your nuvi to the phone store and test the link right there everything so far has worked perfect  .
love the screen , size ,  .
and especially , the customer service  .
many of the magellan people are upset when they call customer service , they cannot understand what they are saying , because there talking to people in india hope this helps  .
i bought this after using quit a few gps navigators  .
i like the nuvi 360 much more  .
it's super quick loading new directions or when you go of course  .
not like tom tom or magellan  .
i put it on my motorcycle and cruised around in my new state with no fear of getting loss and no need to get my hands off the bars because i can just set it cruise and it lets me know how far i'm from home , mph , avg mph , miles in this trip and tons of other stuff  .
finding gas , food , hotel/motel , malls , stores , etc thanks to aaa is my favorite  .
being in a new town it's a must have trying to find the closest grocery store , new job and kids school  .
plus great for hikes  .
i used it to hike through a national park and let me set where i started and helped me make a long circle back  .
nice not to worry that i wo not get lost i got it on amazon for $289 with shipping  .
others that are much bigger and not as fast  .
plus cannot walk around with it or use on a bike or motorcycle , for more or the same price with less capabilities .
i love this product  .
it's packed with features and is so easy to use that when my technically challenged parents saw it they went out and bought one  .
first , just to make it clear , i am not using the mp3 , nor the book reader , or the picture viewer  .
and the dictionary and the calculator/currency converter might be used if we travel to europe , but i seriously doubt it this is a gps navigation unit ; this is why we bought it and this is what is used for  .
and for navigation , as it is a garmin it excells , and this is what is important to us  .
the satellite reception is great  .
the options available while searching destinations are unbelivable , and if you know how to make use of them , you will know what i mean  .
it is small and easy to carry in your bag or even in your pocket  .
you can even hold it in your hand and walk with it (we did it in manhattan 2 weeks ago and we found our way with it) and it is small enough so you will not look like a walking robot the only feature that i considered to be a worthless gimmick and now i have to take my word back is the bluetooth  .
this is an amazing feature  .
the comfort of taking the calls on hands free are just out of this world  .
it works perfect and people on the other side of the line don't even know it  .
if you drive a normal car , and if you use your common sense before you answer the phone , believe me , it works great  .
and being able to call any of the poi's you find during your navigation with a push of a button , it is mindblowing (reserve a room , a table or check for opening hours on the flight) the price for this unit today is 399$ which is really not bad for a gps of this quality  .
it is not much more expensive than the low end nuvi 250 and it is probably the best gps on the market  .
it is true , this unit came to the market in the summer of 2006 , and at the speed the technology is changing today , this is antique stuff , but looking in the garmin line , there is nothing else there better today  .
their new line of nuvi 200 is worthless in my oppinion (see my review on the nuvi 250) , so until they come out with something better , the 350/360 is what you want to buy p  .
just a note on the cons above   we have this unit for month now and it froze on us once  .
it is a bit worrying , because the car is moving on the screen , but we noticed that the touch screen/power button were dead and the unit is not responding  .
i wander what would have happened if we got to a turn   is it going to guide us or not  .
i had to press the reset button in the back and it came back to live and it did not lose any information  .
i have read about these glitches in people's reviews ; i am just surprised this is still happening on a unit that is running in the market for a year  .
we'll wait and see ; maybe we played with it too much while it is navigating  .
for now , we are very happy with this gps .
i have taken four (4) long road trips with my garmin nuvi 360 and it has never gotten me lost nor taken me to the wrong location  .
this is one neat portable device  .
when ever my gas tank gets down to 1/8 of a tank , i search for the closest gas station and the nuvi takes me right to it  .
i have also used the nuvi to search for local restaurants , entertainment , shopping etc  .
i don't know why i waited  .
i cannot imagine taking a trip without it the only reason it does not get a 10 is the bluetooth  .
it works fine and there is no problem discovering my cell or making and receiving calls  .
the problem is the speaker is so small that you cannot hear anything unless you turn off the car stereo and roll up all of the windows  .
there is a headset available that should help with this  .
i'd like to see garmin build in an fm transmitter that allows you to hear everything through the car speakers .
this product is good for anyone who does not want to take days to read the manual  .
it works right out of the box  .
my favorite feature so far is that its bluetooth compatible  .
just sync it up with your phone , (i have a motorola razor v3) and your phonebook transfers to your gps  .
just select the number you ant to call press dial  .
the sound quality is good enough  .
also , the point of interest (poi) feature is really neat  .
just chose a restaurant , store , or anyplace you want to go , and then select dial and you will be connected to the place you want to go  .
good for making reservations , finding store hours , or movie times  .
trust me , im not a computer wiz , and i had no problem getting this to work right away  .
i paid $403 from abes of maine (free shipping , no tax)  .
it got here (ohio) in two days  .
my wife , who is less tech savvy than me , likes mine so much , she wants one for her birthday .
i bought a tomtom device initially , and immediately had problems with the device itself , with their customer support , and overall had to send the unit back for repair (not replacement)  .
i returned the unit and went with the garmin nuvi 370 (i needed europe maps)  .
i loved it immediately  .
it is so much easier to set up , so much easier to use  .
slightly more expensive , but well worth it  .
very user friendly , and fast processor (much faster than my bmw factory gps / navigation  .
) slightly difficult to drag the map but i'm sure i'll get used to it  .
overall , i would get a garmin product in the future (and certainly not a tomtom) .
this is a excellent device  .
i am using this for over 4 months now and have had no problem whatsoever  .
acquiring satellites is fast , directions are fairly accurate and the unit software has never crashed i have never used the picture viewer inside it and so i cannot comment on it but i wish the mp3 player had more features and it is m ore easily accessible from the main navigation screen but these two features are fairly insignificant for me  .
i use it primarily for navigation the mount sometimes falls off the front windshield but it is still better than the one i had for a previous garmin .
this thing is a lifesaver for me  .
i moved to the dc area a few months ago , and every outing to a new locale is a huge huge ordeal  .
anyone who knows dc knows how confusing it can be  .
this little device has solved that problem for me in one fell swoop  .
i've had it for one day and i don't know how i ever lived without it it's true that it doesn't work all that great as a music player  .
there's not a ton of space , no playlist feature , not even a shuffle feature  .
what it does do that is clevery is pause the music to announce turns and exits , then play the music again after the announcement  .
i have an aux line in to my car speakers , and it sounds decent  .
it's so easy to add and remove music since it mounts as a regular harddrive , so the lack of space and or playlist is not a big deal if you just change up a bunch of songs  .
i just think of the music as a bonus i had a little trouble with the hands free phone feature in the car  .
it is great when i tested it at home , but it could not understand me in the car  .
it might be because the unit is too far away from me to hear very well , and because there is a lot of background noise  .
i'm going to keep trying it and see what happens  .
i'm curious about what happens when you are on the phone , listening to music , and using it to dictate directions all at once .
the garmin nuvi 360 is not the first gps navigational device i have used , but it is without a doubt the best  .
physically , the unit is perfectly sized small enough to be unobtrusive or easily hidden , but with a screen plenty large enough to see and use easily while driving this device is extremely easy to use  .
even gps novices can start using the nuvi 360 right away without even peeking at the instructions (which are helpful when needed)  .
the mounting hardware is excellent , well    made , and easy to use acquisition of satellites is super speedy , maybe 30 seconds tops definitely faster than any other car gps system i have used  .
once acquired , the signal is strong i have never yet lost a signal , even while driving through tunnels or thickly wooded areas or through the streets of chicago and new york city , surrounded by skyscrapers (even without the waas on) the directions have been flawless , the maps are very easy to see and read , and the database of poi (points of interest) is pretty good , plus you can manually add more i would give the bluetooth functionality about a b+  .
sometimes i have a tricky time getting the nuvi to pair with my phone , but once they are paired , the bt works very well and , again , is very easy to use  .
i have not used the mp3 player except to play a couple of the sample pre    loaded songs  .
the sound quality from the small speakers is inadequate for music listening and there is no fm transmitter , so the nuvi will definitely not replace an i    pod or mp3 player for those who want even decent sound quality  .
the jpeg    viewer is nothing special certainly not one of the nuvi's strengths overall , this product is unsurpassed in the gps market right now  .
i cannot imagine purchasing a gps device other than the nuvi 360 , unless you are looking to spend less money (this is still a $400 to $500 gadget) or , in the other direction , you want to spend more on a larger device with a wider screen , in which case the nuvi 660 is what you're looking for .
i have had my nuvi 360 for a week now and it is great  .
it has everything a great gps system is suppose to have .
if you guys are in sales , this thing is a beast  .
i recently bought the blackberry curve and combined with the nuvi 360 , they are a force to be reckon with the bluetooth links up flawlessly and the speakerphone is very loud and clear  .
i don't know why it took me so long to buy this  .
if you are a road warrior like me , buy the 360 and the curve and you wo not regret it  .
what a piece of equipment  .
so easy to use  .
the voice commands are generally clear and understandable  .
i found that i had to talk myself into actually believing what the garmin 360 is telling me and one time i decided that i knew better  .
not  .
no problem though the friendly voice informed me the it would recalculate  .
men are renowned for never asking for directions and then getting lost  .
with this gps    i'll be one of those that never has to ask and never gets lost .
in short it is the best in the market as far as i could review and use .
i bought this to use when traveling via rental car , and i figured the bluetooth hands free phone would never work in my loud truck , but it works fine  .
very simple to operate  .
the power cable can plug into the windshield mount    making it effectively a docking station when power is removed (verhicle turned off) it prompts you to switch to battery power , which serves as a reminder to put it in your shirt pocket (it will fit w/no problem) or throw it in the glove compartment it took a free upgrade of my verizon treo's os (1  .
05) to get the poi dialing and speedials to work , but well worth the trouble the text    to    speech makes looking at the 3  .
5 screen optional  .
i mount next to rear view mirror so it is safely visible  .
very portable , very convenient .
i never thought something so small could be so much fun to use and easy to use  .
the nuvi finds most addresses i put in and there is no second guessing  .
i just press go and i let the nuvi guide me all over long island  .
someone said it's the best thing next to an ipod and being a huge ipod user i agree  .
it's like my amex card , i do not leave home without it it may be a little pricey , but worth every penny and it's portable so off to europe it goes unlike the gps that comes preinstalled in your auto try it you'll like it , i assure you .
i did extensive research before i purchased the n�vi 360  .
i is a little concerned about the size of the screen , but when i received it , it is much better than i thought  .
it took about 5 minutes to get it set    up and running  .
the suction cup for the glass is quite strong  .
i love the thin    ness of the unit  .
cannot wait to use it throughout italy this summer  .
the price is just right  .
i would have bought the n�vi 660 , but did not really want to spend that much  .
this is the perfect solution .
this is a wonderful upgrade to my previous unit  .
very compact , very light , long battery life  .
despite reviews saying it should have a manual volume control , that is very minor  .
it is nice having the bluetooth but i do realize now i have very little use for that feature and i do wish i bought the 350 instead  .
my only real negative is the voice directions , unlike my other unit , seem to call the next turn until you are just up to it and it is too late to make the turn so you do have to be careful and memorize the next street or keep watch on the screen  .
oh , and unless i misread the instructions , there should be a dedicated touch key allowing you to go immediately back to the active map  .
if you are elsewhere on the unit , especially if you are several layers deep seaching for an address , you have to keep hitting backspace to the top to view your map .
i did a great deal of on    line and word of mouth research on all things portable gps for several weeks before deciding on the nuvi 360  .
i purchased this particular one because it had all of the features i is looking for  .
i had just traded in my car for another and lost the installed version of a navigation system from jeep  .
i really liked that one and i did not think i could find a portable one that would have been comparable  .
well , i is very wrong  .
the nuvi 360 has all i expected and more  .
the only downside is the cost  .
i do understand if i waited a few months the cost would go down as most electronics do however , i is unwilling to wait  .
overall , this is a great product that is very easy to use .
this is an amazing device  .
it has more features than i imagined  .
my bluetooth phone connected with no instruction , almost surprised me when it rang  .
everyone says my voice is much clearer than when i used a bluetooth earpiece  .
the sd card has also been very helpful  .
no regrets , except i should have bought it sooner  .
we love our garmin  .
it is easy to add our addresses , the instructions were easy , it's also easy to update files from the computer  .
our 12yr old can do it all  .
for rural areas where there are no address , it's easy to set the location as an adress .
wow , just got this yesterday and i'm very impressed with the nuvi 360  .
for a guy that has no sense of direction this thing rocks  .
once locked on it talks you through your destination and even if you make a wrong turn the unit recalculates and gets you back on track  .
includes mp3 player , language guide , audio book player , picture viewer , world clock , currency converter and calculator  .
lots of other fun features too  .
if i could only own one gadget this would be it  .
the garmin nuvi 360 is expensive , but i'll save a ton on gas as i'll never get lost again .
here's the deal , i have researched every gps device out there and i have read just about every review and spoken with seven of my friends who own everything from a tom tom to a nuvi  .
when it come to the nuvi 360    you cannot go wrong  .
the device is well made and loads of fun  .
by now you have read many reviews and you know all about the great features  .
one word of caution  .
i is having trouble picking up satellite connections for the first two weeks and i is getting rather frustrated  .
it is taking about three to five minutes or longer to acquire a signal and that is just unacceptable  .
i therefore contacted garmin and that problem has since been resolved you see , the software on many of the nuvi 360s out there is already out    dated by the time you buy it  .
as of the time of this write    up (12/15/06) , you should be using software version 3  .
30 on your nuvi 360 so how do you know you can check which software is on your nuvi 360 by (1) turning on your device , (2) pressing on the tools icon which looks like a wrench located on the right side of the screen , (3) pressing the system icon , and (4) pressing the about button located on the bottom of the screen if you do not have version 3  .
30 (or better at some point in the future) then you must connect your garmin to your computer via the usb cable and log on to garmin's website to download the latest software (which is free) there are quite a few updates so be patient  .
it took about 20 minutes to upgrade my system on a cable modem connection one more very important thing to be aware of for the best reception , you want to keep the antenna at a 90 degree angle  .
that means you should only open it half way  .
this will increase the surface area and allow you to pick up a satellite feed much faster and with much more signal strength okay , one last thing the nuvi 360 offers waas technology  .
so what does that mean  .
it means that the nuvi 360 will constantly search for the best satellite signal out there and give you better accuracy then the tom tom (only if you have the waas option turned on)  .
so , that begs the question   why not always have it turned on  .
the answer is   battery life  .
if you have it turned on , just be sure that you are connected to an external power supply (i  .
your car) because the uses a lot of power since it is constantly searching for optimal signals  .
to turn the waas option on , just follow the instructions i gave you above in steps 1 through 3 and then press the waas option at the top of the screen all in all , this is a fantastic gp device and definitely worth buying  .
shop carefully because prices vary widely  .
i bought mine over the internet from a reputable source and saved $275 over the retail stores  .
as of 12/15/06 you should not be paying more than $575 (and the price is now coming down even further because garmin has introduced a widescreen version   nuvi 660) in any event  .
check out the prices on cnet  .
com and find out who is offering it at competitive prices  .
i know this is a long review , but i hope this helps happy holidays  .
i just got my nuvi 360  .
this is my second gps  .
my last gps is a lowrance iway 350c and it is a piece of crap (freezes often , major signal lag , doesn't know where im at half of the time , i can list more )  .
good thing i bought it at costco and got my money back ($450 credit) got this nuvi for $550 on sale at costco , i paid only $100 difference  .
that's the beauty of costco , if u don't like your product , you can return any time , i mean any time  .
anyway back to my impression of the nuvi 360  .
here's my impression    .
obvious impression    .
signal capture is fast  .
directions are acurate , reading all the street names  .
super fast route re    calculation  .
stuff you might not know about nuvi 360 that do not cover from reviewers    .
plays mp3z , playlist  .
scan mp3z track but silent when u scan it  .
will automatically pause the music when announcing directions , then continue with the music again  .
if you do a route calculation while the mp3 is playing , you music will lag and skip possibly because the gps processor cannot handle multi    tasking  .
the audio out from the gps is a plus when you have an audio in on your car stereo input  .
you can listen to your music , make phone calls , and voice dial through your car stereo speaker so far i'm very happy with the garmin nuvi 360 , and there's reason why you pay so much  .
you get what you pay for  .
i learned my lesson .
great unit with very easy to use interface , very large poi database , bluetooth comes in handy when someone calls or you want to call a poi in the unit  .
mp3 great but it would be nice to have an fm transmittor built in highly recommended .
so far , i love this gadget  .
it's smaller than i imagined , but it's still very useable  .
it showed up fully charged (  .
) and i is up and running in just a couple minutes  .
i used the usb to connect it to my pc and downloaded a significant update without a hitch the bluetooth works well , it works in varying conditions (sitting below my radio in the ashtray , it worked fine) , and it responds quickly when you fail to pay attention to directions  .
the text to speech is very understandable , although i haven't tried all of the voices i think the only downside is that unless you need the bluetooth , and even if you do want handsfree phoning , this is a hefty premium to pay for some features of potentially limtied use       features like mp3 player , audible book player , traffic navigation and even the bluetooth handsfree without those , yuo could probably get a comparable       although heftier garmin c550 for $300 less  .
and that $300 would more than pay for a bluetooth handsfree device and even a ipod nano  .
the traffic feature , from what i've read elsewhere , is a little immature right now  .
it has a bad tendency to detect traffic jams too late to allow you to choose an alternate route , or hols old traffic jams long after they've cleared  .
i also do not think the nuvi does any kind of smart detouring without you asking it to all in all , i like it so far  .
more later if that opinion changes .
i would rate this product a perfect 10 except for the sound quality  .
not bad but could be improved a little  .
i've tried it walking around downtown manhattan and through northern nj and it has been flawless  .
great features  .
one thing i wish it did have (and it may) is remaining miles to destination  .
this is my first navigation system , but could not imagine one being significantly better at any price than this one  .
i bought at costco  .
com for $650 with tax and shipping  .
cheaper places to get it , but costco is great with returns  .
i will definitely not be returning this .
i just bought the 360 after doing a lot of research  .
i must say , i am totally impressed with this device so far  .
it took 3 seconds to pair with my cell , my pda and my computer  .
made voice activated phone calls with any issues  .
the nav aspect works with out any flaws and so far i have been locking instantly  .
other than the size of the display , i do not think that this unit lacks any thing bottom line , strongly recommend .
i've had the nuvi 360 for 3 days now  .
this is my first gps , but i read a lot of gps reviews including cnet's and consumer reports  .
i'd settled on buying a nuvi 350 until finding out about the 360's bluetooth uses  .
i do a lot of driving for work , and the 360 so far has worked great in mapping out directions , clear easy to read display , and clear spoken directions from jill my 360's chosen voice  .
i love the compact size and that the nuvi can be used as a handheld device  .
also love that garmin provides all the needed wires for charging the nuvi by ac , car lighter , or usb connection to computer  .
i have not yet downloaded map updates , as i have not needed to yet  .
i had the 360 working within 20 minutes , and i is surprised at how easy it is to attach to my car's windshield    took less than 5 minutes to set up the windshield mount  .
also love that the 360 can run on battery power and avoid all the wires while driving  .
i will have to see how long i'm avearaging in battery time per charge all in all , i am satisfied with the purchase thus far , i may post again after having the 360 for awhile  .
my only after purchase regret    is i wish the 360 came with a built in fm receiver  .
i've read the nuvi 660 has one , but looks like it averages at least $100  .
00 more .
this unit is all i'll ever need in a gps device  .
setup is a breeze as the battery is fully charges right out of the box  .
it's very accurate and pretty neat watching myself drive down the road  .
the screen , while very bright , washes out in intense afternoon sun  .
the turn by turn directions are right on and bluetooth is easy to set up for my bb 7290 and moto q  .
it works very well as i have had a number of calls placed thru it  .
it's small footprint does not interfere with my driving view yet the screen is large enough for me to see what is going on  .
i also purchased the traffic antenna which gives me updates on hot spots in the dc area  .
i got it at comp u plus for a little over $600 + shipping  .
updates are easy as it can connect to the pc and get web updates  .
it's kind of peculiar that it has to use it's own usb cable to work  .
i tried using the same one my digital camera uses and the pc would not see it  .
once i changed cables , it came right up  .
this is a sweet little unit and well worth a good look at .
i have been using the nuvi 360 for a little over 2 weeks now and it has met all and exceeded most of my expectations  .
it locks onto satalite signals in 5    10 seconds and i have yet to have it lose the signal while driving  .
the routes are accurate and the text    to    speach voice guidance is clear  .
you barely have to look at the screen at all because the voice prompts call out the distance to the next turn as well as the street name the nuvi 360 has a huge points of interest database and it has found every hotel , restaurant , store , post office , etc that i have searched for  .
the bluetooth feature works great and you can dial the number of any poi simply by touching the screen  .
setting up the bluetooth with my cell phone (motorola razor v3 from cingular) took less than 5 minutes  .
it has worked great with the exception of the fact that in order to hear the caller well in a moving car , the volume usually needs to be at it's maximum and the sound quality at that setting is not perfect i have also purchased the antenna for reciving live traffic and construction information (which includes a 15 month subscription to the service) and that too has performed well  .
it alerts you to traffic jams on your route and automatically re    routes around the slow moving traffic  .
it only works in major metropolitan areas but has been a welcome feature for me while driving the i    95 corridor between new york city and washington d  .
c the only downfalls that i have seen so far are the nuvi 360's price and the fact that the antenna for reciving real time traffic and construction info is not included  .
at it's suggested retail of $899  .
99 , it is one of the most expensive units on the market and you would think that garmin could include the antenna  .
if you do some searching online , you should be able to find the 360 in the mid $700's , from an authorized garmin dealer  .
still not cheap , but i would have to say that so far it has lived up to my expectations .
i just reurned from a trip with my nuvi and must say that it exceeded my expectations  .
i bought the nuvi 360 online for under $700  .
there is no reason for you to pay more right now , just search price online the nuvi arrived and is ready for action right out of the box  .
i turned it on , mounted it in the window suction mount that holds solid as a rock  .
immediately my location appeared and i is ready to punch in my destination  .
within seconds my route is established and i is on my way  .
the voice prompts alone could have taken me where i is going , but the screen also highlighted my route clearly  .
the turns were noted in advance with a voive prompt that named the street as well , very cool  .
there are two voices to choose from , jack or jill  .
others are available if you want different accents , etc  .
there are 8 languages to choose from with the nuvi 360  .
a few awesome features include the bluetooth that syncs to my phone and my phones contact list  .
i can make and recive calls handfree  .
also , if you want to find a place to eat , gas station , golf course , etc  .
just ask nuvi and seconds later an array are choices are available with addresses , phone numbers , and of course directions with the touch of the nuvi's brilliant screen  .
i found a golf course in a flash driving in westerly , rhode island  .
this unit is incredible and a must for travelers or sales people on the road  .
another feature i like is the tracking data that is stored for your trip  .
the unit calculates your time of arrival to the minute and tells you your time driving , time waiting , average speed , max speed and direction  .
included with the item is a home charger , car charger , pouch and usb cable , plus the window mounting device  .
finally the unit has other applications that you can read about on the garmin website that are somewhat useful , but mere throw ins after you consider the primary use of this device is a gps  .
i hope if you are on the fence you take the plunge and buy this as it is well worth the cost  .
also , if bluetooth is not a feature you need you can buy the nuvi 350 for about $100 less .
i purchased this because i wanted a portable gps unit that could slip into a pocket  .
my priority is to have a simple to use gps  .
everything else is extra fluff , but very nice fluff i have a bluetooth gps that works with my notebook and palm , but it doesn't provide the bird's eye 3d view and the hassle of loading maps and routes is too time consuming for spur of the momment trips the blue tooth is great for my hands free cellphone , no headset anymore while driving sharing photos is nice , but the viewing angle limited the number people being able to view the photos at the same time the best thing is the portability  .
which is why i chose this over the c550  .
i can take this and program my next route , or use it for any of the additional features the screen is bright and looking straight on , it's not a problem , but if you have a passenger assisting or wanting to use , it will be hard to share the view  .
c550 screen is much better , not sure why they did not use the same screen initially , i thought the maps might be outdated as some of the roads appear to not to be there , but zooming in solved this problem likes   no moving parts , all flash  .
i like sd format as everything i have is sd (camera , palm , etc)  .
i've seen units with hard drives  .
one more thing that could break  .
hands free blue tooth speaker , no more headsets  .
like being able to save personal pois and being able to re    route to them with just a few key strokes  .
like being able to make calls to pois including my personal pois  .
the preview route feature is nice if you want to review the route prior to driving dislikes   my biggest complaint is the difficulty removing the unit from the holder which needs to be done in order to retract the antenna if you wish to take with you  .
my fear is the tourque will at some point crack the case or worse , the screen wish list   video support , better screen similar to garmin c550 , built in traffic antenna , built in fm transmitter , easier to remove holder , pouch with a belt clip  .
retry times for punching in your security code  .
speed control for route preview  .
hard cover to protect the screen would be nice  .
increase range of motion for the holder (has a small arm with limited movement options) overall , great first impressions  .
cannot wait to try the traffic features , need to get the antenna first .
by far  .
this is the best portable gps system i've ever used  .
a snap out of the box setup and you are ready to hit the streets  .
acquires stalites in a flash and calculates your rout in a second and you are off  .
finds everything you'll ever need and more  .
light and portable so you can navigate while you walk  .
mp3 player , currency/measurement converter  .
all in a compact and stylish design well done garmin .
okay , the one thing i gotta ask , does this support downloadable world maps or just the us/canada/and some parts of mexico  .
this would be the ultimate travel gadget if you can take it around the world  .
okay , at least any other countries so you don't get lost  .
if anyone knows about a world gps , please post , still wondering about this one i'm taking a guess here , but my guess for not suggesting using it on a bike is due to a micro hard drive  .
this is my guess so do not quote me on it  .
it's too bad , it would be a perfect match on a mountain bike too as for the price , it looks great , but still too steep for my pocket  .
sd support , very cool  .
i'll wait for the competition to see what's going to top this  .
the competition has a great challenge ahead of them this thing is just cool , and when they get whatever bugs worked out and make it upgradable , then it will really kick more butt  .
then again , it already does  .
santa , i want one for my birthday , or christmas is good too .
after 2 weeks i had the following isues    .
bluetooth pairing with rogers treo 650 had some glitches (unable to send contact phone numbers to nuvi and some phone resets during calls) bike/hike use limited as unit not water resistant and no features like topo maps , backtracking , track recording (trail of breadcrumbs) , in short not much use for mapping or off road use unable to load waypoints (lists of locations of things like speed traps , tourist sites etc  .
available on the net) using garmins free poi loader (get error message) as an in car unit the nuvi is fun and easy to use and accurate  .
location is acquired in about 20 seconds after turn on  .
i cannot wait to use the unit in europe (the europe maps are about $450 cdn though) where the travel features will come in handy (text to voice dictionary and phrases , currency converter etc  .
the display is very readable in daylight the design and ease of use of this unit is exceptional compared to my other tech gadgets and this unit will only enhance garmin's reputation .
i have been waiting and it finally arrived , wow  .
i had it up and running in 20 minutes out of the box  .
i had read the manual on line weeks ago  .
the size and bluetooth feature is what sold me in my research of gps units for my car  .
i have a cingular 8125 and the two synched up with ease  .
yes , the sound is not like having the phone in your hand but its good enough  .
i did get an ear piece as well , the functions are easy and convenient  .
i used the dash mount (stickey pad) with great thought about my new car dash but i wanted it to sit directly in front of my face (no distraction at all) with out obstructing my view  .
when i remove the mount you really do not notice the sticky pad , so i'm happy with that  .
this being my first gps and after researching for 5+months i am very pleased with the nuvi 360  .
i will probably never use the photo or music feature  .
i have lived at the same address for ten years and i am finding out the names of streets that i never knew , something kinda funny  .
i give the nuvi 360 a 9+  .
i have owned the new nuvi 360 for two weeks now  .
previous to this , i had the nuvi 350 , which is also an excellent device  .
since the function is identical in nearly every regard to the 350 , there is little point in covering the basics in much depth , but it's worth re    stating some of them  .
i will go into great detail on the bluetooth functionality below this is such a handy device , and is so well executed , that you would be hard    pressed not to love it  .
the first thing i noticed about the nuvi is its incredibly small size and weight  .
i could not believe how light it was  .
i literally expected it to have at least twice the heft when i went to pick it up the first time    it is like picking up a deck of cards , but lighter the antenna is a flap that is raised from the back , maybe about the size of a matchbook  .
when raised the nuvi immediately starts locking in on satellites , when lowered , the unit knows you are through navigating for a while  .
intuitive and effective navigation on the nuvi is very good , fast , and intuitive  .
it's no different from many of garmin's other offerings in that regard  .
some buildings and businesses that you would expect to be shown as pois are not there , but most are  .
one thing i would suggest   when a route is less than ideal , garmin should allow you to correct it permanently so that it does not re    suggest the non    preferred route each time the screen clarity is good , but i understand that an antiglare screen protector is made which really improves the clarity  .
i will probably be researching and buying one , as direct sun does make the screen very hard to read i had a problem with my nuvi 350 that i have not observed on the new 360  .
sometimes the 350 would not lock onto the satellite signal  .
once it went into this mode of searching for , but not locking in , for over a minute it just never found anything  .
the only way i found to correct this is to push the small reset button under the antenna  .
i notice that another reviewer found that his new 360 had the same problem  .
this must be a bug in some nuvi units that would be worth following up with garmin on  .
i can tell you that my 360 never has required a reboot , and i've been using it continuously i did not test the mp3 functionality beyond verifying that it plays back the songs that are pre    loaded for demo purposes  .
i did not care about this feature ; i'm very happy with my ipod for song management and playback  .
i can verify that you would not want to use the nuvi's internal speaker for song playback , though  .
it's good enough to use as a speakerphone and for voice prompts , but it's not a hi    fi now , for the fun part   bluetooth functionality  .
i have been using it with my blackberry 8700c with excellent results so far  .
i had no problems with the initial discovery and mating process  .
the interface is robust  .
what happens is that once your phone has made the connection with the 360 , a phone icon appears on the nuvi  .
you can now use the 360 to call any poi directly from the screen  .
this is truly amazing ; you are now walking around with the yellow pages in the palm of your hand , sortable by your current location , or any other location you choose  .
i just find the point of interest , and touch the phone number of that poi , and the phone starts dialing it  .
the sound comes out through the speaker of the nuvi , and conversations have been natural so far  .
it's working like an absolute charm , and this single feature moves the device beyond anything else available right now when you select the phone icon from the main screen , several phone    related icons appear  .
from the phone screen , you can make a call manually , access your address book , call a poi , etceteras  .
the manual dial function works fine from the touchscreen  .
the really cool news   nuvi automatically downloads your phone's address book to its database when it makes the initial bluetooth link  .
so , if your phone supports this functionality , you can use it for all dialing functions , since the display is so much nicer than most phones , and the touchscreen works really well  .
you can always break the bt connection once you get the number dialed if you want a private , non    speakerphoned conversation  .
i have done that many times already  .
once your call ends , the connection to the nuvi is reestablished automatically  .
one word of warning   blackberry does not support sending its addresses to the nuvi , so i is unable to test the download feature , but this does not surprise me given blackberry's security obsession  .
i am confident that it would work fine with other supported phones overall , the device is a joy to operate  .
the battery life is good , although i would not call it excellent  .
the menus are very intuitive  .
the accuracy is very high  .
even the windshield mount earns my praise  .
i did a lot of research on the nuvi , comparing it in excruciating detail to the latest tom tom 910 , the magellan roadmate 800 , etceteras  .
the 350 is a great unit , the 360's bluetooth functionality makes it even better , and worth the extra money for me note   i just returned from a 4 day trip to banff , canada during which i logged another 20 hours of driving  .
the unit continues to perform perfectly , including comprehensive pois in the banff/lake louise area  .
i also discovered an amazing feature i had not noticed before  .
i is unfamiliar with the lake louise area and had three hungry kids in the car  .
i pressed where to , then restaurants , and the list appeared , in order of proximity to my moving vehicle  .
each listing showed the distance to that restaurant , with a little arrow next to it showing the exact direction to that restaurant  .
i just left it on this page and drove around , following the arrows , which moved as i did , until i found a restaurant that looked good  .
what an amazing device  .
i also have nothing but praise for the window mount  .
seems like a small thing , but it's so solid and well    designed i had to make special mention of it  .
it has a lever to easily create a large suction force , the ball joints are very solid , and the method of attachment to the nuvi is just extremely well designed .
my 1st gps is (still have it) a garmin streetpilot 330  .
i struggled following directions in very tight intersections and many times i took the wrong street so i got a nuvi 360 mostly for its tts capability and secondary because the screen in the 330 is difficult to see in bright sunlight  .
i've had the nuvi for a couple of days and it's addressed this two issues very nicely  .
but i am additionally pleased with how fast it acquires satellites , it's accuracy and the fact that touching on the screen on poi gives you address and phone of the place , and more pleased on how it integrates all that with my bt phone , i have a bt headset and it is now going to be used only when i'm not in my car  .
i have an ipod connected directly to my stereo , so the mp3 player is of no value for me  .
the only reason i do not give it a 10 is that occasionally when i turn it on it hangs with a message that it is updating the bt firmware and i have to reset it  .
i'm contacting garmin to figure out why it does that .
i'm throughly happy with this product after first power up , within 30 minutes i is able to use all the functions of the device  .
very easy to integrate and use .
for everyone who is asking , they are available at some retailers now  .
just do a little searching and you'll find it  .
and , if nothing else , you can get it on ebay too i've had mine for a week and this is the first gps unit i have ever owned or used , so i may not be as insightful as others could be  .
i did a lot of searching online and what attracted me to this unit is the bluetooth and the size and garmin's reputation  .
plus , the positive reviews for the nuvi 350 almost made me purchase that one despite no bluetooth , so when i saw this one i knew it is the one for me the routes have been great , it gives me routes that i would normally take  .
it does a great job of recalculating when you go off    route  .
the bird's eye view is great and the user interface is pretty intuitive  .
i had it working pretty easily right out of the box  .
there are a variety of voices to choose from as well , which is nice  .
plus , one really nice thing is , mine came completely charged  .
thank you garmin for not making me wait to use my new toy while it charges for 3 hours like every other piece of tech i've ever purchased  .
the pois seem to be pretty good , it has found everything i've looked for in the last few days , including a small neighborhood restaurant  .
being able to dial the pois is a great feature as well  .
i haven't tested it too extensively , but searching for maybe 10 things , it has been able to locate all of them for me the bluetooth has been pretty decent  .
i paired it with a blackberry 7100g (cingular) and didn't have any problems pairing  .
i've had a few conversations that worked pretty well  .
my sister said that it sounded fine on her except that it is obvious she is on speaker phone  .
i wish the phone book transfer is available with the blackberry , but it is not  .
i have a friend who has cingular as well and trying to call him a few times ends up not working  .
it shows that it is dialing , but it never rings and never disconnects  .
but , if he calls me , it rings right through and i can answer it on the nuvi i haven't used any of the travel guide/language/currency converter stuff  .
the audio books things would be nice if i travelled distances  .
the mp3 player is not anything fancy , the speaker on the nuvi distorts with too loud of music , but i suppose you could use an fm transmitter or hook it directy to your stereo if you have the input  .
i synced a song to the nuvi using windows media player , but i couldn't find it on the device with the mp3 player  .
i searched it on my computer when i got back home and it had created a folder for the song , but all of the other music (sample tunes) were in a different folder , so i transfered the song to that folder manually  .
the mp3 player still couldn't find the file  .
i haven't played around with it since then , as it was not a pressing matter , but perhaps i'm just missing something right now  .
the sample songs played just fine on the unit though the garmin lock feature seems nice , but if it gets stolen , it's gone  .
the lock feature wo not do much good then  .
i thought it sounded like a neat idea , but what's the point the lock now that i have it  .
i suppose if you use the nuvi as a harddrive and put sensitive documents on there it comes with a windshield mount , a plastic disk with adhesive to create your own mounting space , a car/cigaratte lighter charger , a household outlet charger , a nice leather case to protect the screen (i throw it in my pocket or in my wife's purse when not in the car to keep it from getting stolen) and instuction booklets/quick start guides in several languages that's about all i can think of right now  .
if you ask questions , i'll check back periodically to see if i can answer them .
this is the best gps system i have used  .
it is better than tomtom go 910 by far .
owned it for less than a week  .
love it , but it could use improvements  .
for example , if you're driving down a dark street and looking for a house , it tells you approximately where it is , not exactly where it is  .
you then have to guess the house number if the lights are not on or the number is not visible on the curbside i wish there is software to attach the nuvi to your computer and type in everything on the keyboard instead of on the nuvi keyboard screen would be nice if you could create separate folders for your favorites  .
ie   restaurants , clubs , etc  .
poi files are like that , but i mean your own customized folders in where to , my locations hopefully the next series of firmware upgrades will address some of these issues otherwise , for $249  .
99 at costco , it's very hard to beat , especially since the costlier one with the 4  .
3 screen does not have bluetooth capability .
i used a gps for the first time this summer when my daughter and i were visiting colleges down south  .
we rented the garmin street pilot and without it , probably wouldn't have made it to most of our appointments on time  .
i also rented the street pilot on a recent trip to ca  .
after that , i decided i had to have a gps and have been researching several garmin models ever since i is thrilled when my family got me the nuvi 360 for christmas  .
it's everything i wanted and more  .
i love that it announces the street names rather than saying turn left or right (like the one i had in ca)  .
it is compact , easy to connect and disconnect from the mount , and the display is bright  .
the maps are accurate , and although it does take the long way around on occasion , it gets the job done  .
i haven't decided whether the faster or shorter trip setting is best i had some challenges trying to setup the bluetooth with my blackberry 8830  .
the nuvi keeps disconnecting from the phone and i have had to delete the device setups on both the gps and phone several times  .
there doesn't seem to be much about this problem online ; however , i did find a recommendation that you connect to the gps from your phone  .
i tried that and it seems better , although it stills disconnects for no apparent reason i specifically wanted bluetooth capability as i will be getting hearing aids and will no longer be able to use a headset  .
i keep keep the volume at maximum ; however , when i use the bluetooth hands free , there seems to be some feedback for the person on the other end  .
due to the lack of external volume controls , i find it difficult to use the menu to adjust the volume , not to mention it is not safe while driving overall , i'm very happy with the nuvi and feel that garmin puts out a superior product  .
if i were buying one for myself , i would probably lean towards the street pilot  .
i think i would trade in the smaller unit for a larger one with external volume controls  .
however , it all comes down to personal preference and i would not hesitate to recommend the nuvi 360  .
oh yeah , the battery could last a little longer too  .
i recently bought the 360 from newegg for about $350 plus tax and shipping  .
i played around with it in north jersey for a few days then tested it out in vegas and arizona for a week  .
after spending years the night before a trip printing out maps and reveiwing aaa tour books it is nice to be able to just grab my nuvi and head out the door  .
it is such a great little device  .
it is hard initially to trust it but it proved itself well  .
there were a few instances where it did not have the correct exit numbers on i    15 near the strip but with since it said both the street name and exit , i is able to figure it out  .
i am sure it would have confused someone that is totally unaware of the area so that could have been a real problem  .
i drove out to the grand canyon from vegas and it pretty much got me to the hotel exactly  .
it is about a block off but i figured it out  .
there is one point where the 360 just shut off on me after a full charge and two hours of driving  .
i really wish it had a low battery warning  .
it actually shut off right when i made a wrong turn and needed a correction  .
luckly my wife grabbed the car charger and got it up and running  .
all in all this is a really great  .
if they would fix the battery issue and make corrections on the maps and let you update them for free it would be even better  .
also be prepared that the price seems to just keep dropping just make sure to bring a map  .
you may never need it but you should never let yourself be too dependent on an electronic device  .
you never know what might happen .
the gps directions work great  .
the voice indicate exit numbers and street names not just left and right  .
the maps are good enough in my area  .
the number of feet to a turn is a little too high (50ft) , but i got used to it  .
the screen is big enough to see where you are going the bluetooth connection with my blackberry works great  .
often the bb is in the trunk of my car and it still connects  .
the call quality is not too bad either i use the mp3 functionality every day  .
the sound quality is decent and good enough for me  .
i have to put the volume at the max and would have liked it a little louder more people compained about the car charger delivered with the unit  .
the first one only lasted 3 months and the second is lasting longer  .
the suction cup doesn't like the texas heat  .
i do not like to take it down every day  .
after 1 week in the sun it is almost impossible to remove it from the window  .
i bought the bean bag and that works great for me this unit is not perfect  .
i can live with the short comings and i would buy this unit again .
i am probably the worst driver in the world (not accident    prone , but always get lost)  .
nuvi has been a god    send  .
i bought it a year ago to replace my stolen quest , another garmin product but lower    end  .
i have been very satisfied w/ garmin , and rely on it daily when driving  .
i still get lost (by day dreaming and not listening) but nuvi got me back on track in no    time  .
pronounciation of street names a big big plus  .
without it i get off    route a lot more  .
my biggest complaint is the volumn for voice prompt  .
i set it at maximum and on high way it's barely enough  .
meanwhile if a phone comes in through the bluetooth it will blast my ears off  .
adjusting the volumn takes your eyes off the road so i just try to live with the flaw  .
another downside   it's great for driving from a to b  .
if you are planning your trip as a tourist , you may still need a good old fashioned tour book or map  .
they are better and a lot cheaper (often free at welcome centers) than garmin's own travel guides  .
also , don't expect the places of interests are totally up    to    date  .
luckily phone numbers are included , so to be sure , call it before heading to the location  .
another downside is that due to the small screen and large text , some descriptions are trunctaed  .
for example , last year my gf and i drove to florida for sight    seeing  .
we decided to see the kennedy space center and entered it in the search box  .
i pressed the first match that appeared on the screen , which says kennedy space center  .
we followed the directions and eventually ended up in the kennedy space center credit union in the middle of a city  .
we laughted our stomach sore but also wasted couple of precious hours  .
what happened is that there were many matches for kennedy space center but the rest of hte descriptions were all truncated off  .
you need to click each match to see the full description  .
i is in a hurry and did not look careful at the next screen  .
besides i assume there is only one kennedy space center  .
for my next navigator i will buy the wide    screen one .
i strongly recommend this product  .
i had a built    in gps in my 2000 sedan ; however , the maps are now outdated and the expense of getting updated cd maps are almost as much as the nuvi  .
also , i can use the nuvi in my other cars  .
admittedly , the car gps has better accuracy and features ; but , the nuvi does a very good job of navigating and has a lot of personal features  .
the bluetooth function works great with my samsung a    920 cell phone  .
the nuvi is very easy to use  .
i did not have to read the instruction manual for basic operation  .
in fact , a lot of my friends are thinking about buying one , too , because of how easy it is to learn and use  .
my biggest complaint is that the speaker is not loud enough  .
also , given the cost of the unit , garmin should go ahead and give you a full version of the foreign dictionary and phrase book  .
also , you need to go to the garmin website regularly to ensure that you have the latest software updates  .
notwithstanding these relatively minor irritations , i would highly recommend this unit .
i purchased the nuvi 360 primaraly to have while traveling for work  .
i'm often in cities i'm not familiar with and the 360 has proven to be great in providing point to point directions  .
the crisp display/touch interface is very intuitive for experienced gps users as well as techno    phobes  .
entering destinations and way    points can be accomplished by either providing the address or in the case of businesses the name or type of operation (i  .
kam han , chinese restaurant)  .
it is quick to acquire satellites and determine your current position even after powering up in a new location thousands of miles from the last the bluetooth functionality is decent but like most hands free devices there tends to be a problem in callers hearing you while driving  .
it's mp3 player is by no means stereo quality but is a nice option to listen to your music or podcasts in a city where you're not familiar with the local radio options  .
other features like the calculator , language translator (which is only useful if you purchase the additional language package) , converter are nice but frankly aren't the reasons most people purchase a compact gps as someone who travels a fair bit and is a self    admitted gadget freak i'm always annoyed when i need to carry an additional power supply or synch cable (don't need the added weight or bulk in my briefcase)  .
to its credit , the nuvi 360 uses a standard usb    mini b connector and you can charge though your pc's usb port it does not accept a standard 12v cigarette lighter charger used for cell's/blackberry's another added feature of any garmin product is the availability of extras and replacement parts  .
its always easy to find a local supply of the disposable adhesive mounting discs or brackets all in all a very solid product , well priced and better value then similar tom    tom or mio .
i debated and tried many so    called portable gps units until finally buying (and keeping) this one  .
this is the one to get  .
the best ones on market are the garmin nuvi line and the tomtom go line  .
within the nuvi line , the 660 and 360 are identical , except that the 660 is bigger (negative for portability as compared with smaller 360) and comes with the traffic receiver integrated (plus over the 360)  .
660 is $200 more in list price and $400 more in reality (street price)  .
360 can do traffic , too , but have to buy traffic device       but that purchase includes 15 months of free service , where the 660 only gives you 3 months and then you have to spend $60 for the extra 12 months  .
360 fits in pocket (any pocket) , but 660 is too long to fit in most pockets       would only fit comfortably in purse  .
so , if portability is your driver , get the 360 and not the 660  .
if size and price do not matter , then you may prefer the 660 why nuvi over tomtom  .
well , the 910 is a fantastic model , but it is not very portable , and has maps and poi's that are more outdated than garmin nuvi line  .
on plus side , tomtom 910 has 20 gb harddrive , with 12 gb free for your music storage , and its routing software is much better than garmin's  .
but in day to day use , garmin's routing is good enough , and portability means that you will have it with you in all situations , including when you are traveling  .
also , garmin mount is truly clip on/clip off , where tomtom's is difficult i also looked at magellan's new lines , but its routing is not very good (worse than both tomtom and garmin) , and it is much bigger than nuvi       even the new magellan portable lineup of 2200t and crossover models so , in end , if portability is your top goal , go with nuvi 360 (text to speech (says street names) , bluetooth , loud speaker volume (when mounted in car , sound reflects off windshield and sounds like it's in radio or center of car) , and traffic function with add    on cable (i have it , and despite negative comments re tmc accuracy , i have found it to be very accurate in chicago and a lifesaver)) if you search around , you can find it in major chains and locally in reliable stores for $540    $550  .
at that price , it is an unparelleled deal       given that 600 is $900 bucks ($750 at best , lowest , online price) trust me , and enjoy .
the n�vi 360 is an excellent companion  .
on several critical issues it is better than the tomtom 910 , that i had opportunity to try this summer  .
the n�vi is very compact and easy to handle  .
the mount is excellent  .
on the plus    side for tomtom stands a larger poi    database , somehat better graphics and the large disc  .
tomtom's mount , however , is nothing but a catastrophe  .
it is shaky , the unit is tricky to snap on , and often there is bad contact between the unit and the power supply  .
so n�vi easily wins the competition  .
but the poi database should really be larger  .
now , garmin offers the travel guide , which contains more poi's  .
but it will cost you $160 extra  .
i have been waiting months for this unit with the understanding it would have the same bluetooth capability as the 2820       phone pairing plus headset/ext    speaker pairing for directions  .
however , they supposedly changed the design at the last minute to make it only compatible with the phone why would you ever include a bicycle mode and then say it is not recommended to be put on a bike  .
i'm probably going to buy it anyway , but what a shame when they had such a chance at a total home run  .
imagine the size of the target market if it were more friendly to geocaching , bicycle touring , and bt peripherals       they could consolidate half their lineup into one unit .
i am happy with this unit , but am disappointed that it costs so much for new maps  .
they would sell a lot more map updates if they only charged $20    $25  .
as it is , where roads have been reconfigured , i just figure it out another downside is that you cannot put in five addresses and have it route you in the order that makes most sense  .
you can only put in two addresses and do a via with the one you have decided you want to go to first  .
i have been looking at homes though , in an unfamiliar area and it would be nice to be able to put in five or ten addresses and have it take me the most sensible way i only gave a 3  .
5 because there is no arrow on the main map screen and that is a pain in the butt  .
recently bought this one  .
though it is my first gps , i had lot of expectations  .
found 360 as little cheap compared to others and also rich in functionality  .
i had to buy this because of my recent long distance trip , but little disappointed with the accuracy of the destinations  .
and also i am not sure if i have to update the software  .
have not used the mp3 yet .
i is comparing the garmin nuvi 360 ($289)with the magellan 3225 (at $150) , and used both for a little while before finally deciding to keep the magellan 3225 (which ended up costing about half the price of the 360)  .
i like how simple the 3225 is to use  .
i used the 3225 to drive up to gravenhurst ontario (muskoka cottage country) from ottawa using smaller highways and it always tells you which highway you are on and which is the next one you are turning on and the direction you will be turning to prepare yourself well in advance  .
the 3225 gives you clear audible and visual arrow warnings/directions 3km and then 1km before having to make any turns  .
enter the address and the 3225 gives you four options on arriving there using shortest distance , fastest route , most/least use of freeways as well as the option to avoid using toll roads with the garmin , you had to go through a serious of screens to find the main options page every time to select shortest distance or fastest route , which is a pain  .
also , the 3225 intelligently blacks out street names and addresses that do not exist (garmin does not)  .
also the garmin 360 just said turn in i  .
10 km (or whatever distance) but did not tell you in which direction until the very last moment , which left me hanging until the very last moment , when sometimes , it is too late to get into the proper lane  .
the garmin does audibly say left/right turn , as soon as you finish making the previous turn , but by then , it would be too early to remember if the next turn is minutes away and you would have to take your eyes off the road and press the next turn page , which is dangerous  .
the garmin 360 does have partial sample dictionary (which if you want the full version you have to pay more money) , mp3s (which is redundant because which cars dont already have a stereo  .
) and a host of other fluffy items , such as customizing the car view on the map (which wont help you navigate any better) , but misses some good solid features that the magellan 3225 has at half the price  .
the garmin also has an annoying antenna that you have to open and close after each use , while the 3225 does not  .
even if both were the same price , hands down , i would go with the 3225 based on ease of use and functions good job magellan garmin , back to the drawing board  you may want to check out what your competition offers at half the price  .
i have had good success with the unit in general  .
the maps in around toronto and montreal are not 100% accurate for some streets , which kind of surprised me , but there are very few streets that i have had any trouble with  .
otherwise i think this is a great unit , worth the purchase , especially if you want to use it out of the car and carry it with you  .
i tried a street pilot unit before i bought this one and it worked really well on our trip to the us , and liked the garmin make so much i bought this one  .
the size difference is huge and in my mind , worth the cost bluetooth did lock up the unit a couple times , and i think it relates to when my treo 700p is talking to my bt headset , and then i turn on the nuvi and it gets confused that there are two bt devices competing for one phone  .
anyhow , just turn off the headset before you get into car and it works fine .
for a particular source and destination , this device gave me routes    .
least time   it took me on the interstate and other wide roads , in 14 minutes for 12 miles  .
least distance   it took me through all the narrow roads , sharp turns , in 17 minutes , i wonder to save 3 minutes of mine , it took me additional 4 miles (8 miles for the least distance  .
secondly , the maps are outdated , when i is tired , i selected to go to star bucks , but in fact the star bucks is replaced by a comercial center there it does not give you a glimse of the start to end route map i got confused , when i is in listen only mode and two of the turns were just 5 6 meters apart , and you are at 30mph .
pros  .
it is so small i could carry along with me in my pocket can use wherever i want    lcd tft display is very good    the processor seems very fast    recalculates very quickly    it speaks name of the streets  .
if you drove with one which doesn't announce the name of streets , you would realize how helpful it is 4  .
multiple languages accent  .
for ladies , there is a male voice also  .
but i loved that so many females are always ready to talk to me  .
expensive 2  .
speaker is not good  .
it is like speaker is messed up  .
i thought it is my unit , but then i checked with my friend , who owns the same unit  .
he also had the same problem since i bought from walmart , a store with excellent return policy i returned it  .
since i is spending so much money    i could not live with lacklustre speaker  .
apart from speakers , awesome device .
i purchased the nuvi 360 as soon as it became available and my dissappointment has been increasing with every software update that garmin releases as a device that is supposed to be primarily a navigation unit , garmin has decided to leave out or disable some important features in this pricey little gem of theirs  .
the kicker is that these very usable features are found in some of their less expensive models and in just about all their competitor's (also less expensive) units features such as    .
street / roadblock avoidance  .
planning and saving routes  .
multiple via points  .
weighted slider for highway to road preference  .
tracks / breadcrumb function  .
a detour function with more options  .
it's a shame that garmin decided to cripple the star of their gps line up in such a way  .
for about half the price , you can go invest in garmin's ique (pocket pc) bundle and gps features coming out the wazoo .
i shelled out the extra $100 to get the bluetooth functionality , but it caused more problems than it is worth  .
i first linked my wife's lg phone to the unit , but it could not open her phone book so all outgoing call have to be dialed on the phone's keypad  .
however , when i linked my motorolla phone to the unit , the phone book appeared on the 360 and i is able to make calls  .
the first call worked fine , but the second one caused the unit to freeze requiring a hard reset  .
each time i tried using the phone function , it worked for the first call but froze during the second       which is a problem if you are driving in an unfamiliar area and need to rely on the map it would have been nice to have the phone function particularly because when you search any of the millions of points of interest (which came in very handy during vacation in southern cal) , aside from full address info , you get a little phone incon on the screen that allows you to directly place a call to the point of interest without having to whip out your cell aside from the phone glitches , directions provided are perfect and it works well with the fm traffic receiver to rout you around trouble spots if you are in a large metropolitan area (chicago for me)  .
however , the traffic receiver is a separate connection makes for too many wires  .
i'm trying to decide whether to save a few bucks and go with the 350 since the phone function is useless or to spend a bit more when the 660 comes out in a few days which hopefully corrected the bluetooth bugs and already has the traffic receiver built in (only 3 months free though compared to the 15 month deal you get with the separate antenna) .
perhaps the perfect gps doesn't exist , or i just cannot afford it  .
my last gps is a mio , which generally gave surprisingly good directions , but the model did not include street name announcement which at times is frustrating , or downright dangerous  .
also , there technical support is unbelievably awful  .
i is told that garmin gave great directions , and most of the reviews i've read here , affirm that  .
therefore , i have to conclude that it's just a little goofy around where i live (arlington , virginia) because at times just to test it i ve followed it in my neighborhood and i m literally being asked to go beyond the end of dead end streets  .
on the otherhand , i just went to a meeting in a remote section of dc and i arrived earlier than everyone because it directed me so well , so who knows  .
i do wish she spoke a little louder  .
i have to keep the windows closed on highways to hear the directions , and forget about using the radio or audio .
the maps are slightly outdated (a new freeway is constructed two years ago , but is not on the map)  .
the bluetooth hands    free device is difficult to hear and receive (sounds like taking into a box)  .
recommend buying 350 and using headset for your cell phone as well as updating the map at $75  .
00 per garmin  .
the garmin product , however , is of high quality  .
i am very pleased with the product , especially the portability and size , but wish that i had not spent the extra money on the bluetooth .
i am a field engineer in san francisco area  .
i have owned several gps units for the past five years  .
i have used megallan 800 , which the screen is very unreadable in bright light when wearing my polaroid glasses , and took me in wrong directions as well , so i am a garmin guy  .
the garmin 2620 is my first , which had bad reception back then , but the 2720 had been excellent for me  .
i am a gadget guy and always in the look for better  .
i thought nuvi 360 is the best when read basically all the reviews , and compared the ratings  .
not really  .
first of all the bluetooth is annoying , and interfered with the bluetooth ear piece i'd rather use  .
and to switch from phone to the gps bluetooth is another piece to tinker with while driving the travel kit with the nuvi is cute , but not helpful when driving , and most of the items required extra installation and fees  .
i didn't really care for the care kit  .
my treo is good enough for that use the gps system which is the only thing i needed when driving didn't work as good as the 2720  .
the settings for the interface is very limited , the auto zoom is not adjustable , the amount of info on display not adjustable , light needed to be manually adjusted to surroundings very often , in order to read the screen with my glasses , which is not the case with the garmin 2720 , the latter has auto light adjust just perfectly  .
the nuvi did actually have a better reception , but the 2720 work most often anyway with the 360 , when making turns on streets with several branch street , it is an eye sore , and confusing , since the zoom is limited , and the writing is too small , and the sound not as clear , in comparison to the 2720 , which for driving is way more superior another cute items that i did not care for are the vehicle icons  .
if you are driving with track up direction , you only see the rear of the vehicle icon , which is too wide to distinguish street routes  .
the colorful arrow icons available are better icons  .
the 2720 is the keeper for me .
when i bought it and started using it , it is fantastic  .
i is very impressed with all the features that come with it and the maps seem to be pretty up    to    date after about a month , i began to get annoyed with it  .
the maps are so hopelessly outdated ; telling me to take a road that has long ago become more of a hiking trail behind a warehouse  .
the features are actually pretty useless keeping the gps plugged in with the unit off slowly kills the battery's life  .
so what good is having a picture viewer  .
are you going to look at pictures while you're driving  .
the bluetooth oh god the bluetooth  .
i have a jeep grand cherokee so it's not very noisy inside , though it may not be the quietest  .
but the volume is not loud enough for me to hear when i'm on the phone with somebody  .
plus , there is no background noise filter  .
then if i get out of the car with the gps on and i have a call coming in , even if i click [activate handset] , the gps will keep taking over  .
then i sit there wondering what happened like the at t commercial  .
granted , the gps is smart enough to shut up when i'm on the phone , just giving text directions rather than voice , but it's still annoying also , the detour feature that is available only actually gives one other alternate route lastly , whether you pick shortest distance or the shortest time directions , they're usually the same  .
yes , the same stupid route that no local person would ever take  .
it gave me directions from jacksonville , fl ro atlanta , ga  .
it turned my 7    hour trip into a 9 1/2 hour trip by taking me through all these country roads where i is stuck pickup trucks traveling 40 mph below the speed limit i would have given the nuvi 360 a worse rating except for the fact that this is the best for your money  .
but , i would not buy this again .
if you are planning on using a gps in your vehicle only , there are better units to be had  .
satellite acquisition is slow , as is recalculation after missing a turn (which could be a problem in i need a route now situations , and pre    turn warnings often left me on top of the street and having to make fast lane changes there are lots of bells and whistles (downloadable car icons , an mp3 player , travel kit , etc) , but all of the positives were overshadowed by one issue with the one i bought       the speaker quit working as soon as i would plug it into the vehicle mount  .
it turned on again when it is taken off , so i'm sure it is just a bad wiring job inside but as with other electronics , i've learned if you get a bad one out of the box , find something different  .
the qc just is not there personally , i'm going back to my streetpilot 340  .
i have now had the unit for a few days , and realized that it is useless beyond car navigation i am very disappointed that it cannot do some of the basic gps functions  .
i upgraded to this gps from another garmin one , focussing on the high end features , but did not realize it is poorly executed on the low end , i probably would have chosen something else  .
what i miss    .
tracks and log files       these are indispensible for any portable gps , i find it very disappointing that this is not included  .
as this is meant for travel , on the go this is indispensable  .
bluechart compatibility   this is the perfect unit to take on small runabout boats i don't understand why bluecharts are not supported  .
it is not waterproof , but users can take the responsibility    more configuration options       it seems like you made it easy for the masses , but forgot the interest of other gps users  .
i think an advance page could have easily been added to make it customizable as the older gps were  .
specifically , the poi do not become visible until you are very zoomed in , it would be good to be able to program at what zoom level they become visible , similar to your older gps  .
many other configuration options are missing as well  .
compass page       not as big of a deal as above , but would be nice , especially for hicking    bluetooth   i would have thout it would be tighter integrated , allowing you to do downloads + other mapsource interraction without using the usb cable  .
only used for phone  .
nmea incompatible       i do not understand why it is not  .
eapecially with bluetooth , this would have been a great feature overall , i thought garmin would continue to add features to their gps rather than drop what has made them succesfull in the past  .
this is a high end portable gps unit , and as such , it should have the basic features  .
i am very disappointed in the software of this unit and the limited capabilities  .
it could have been a great gps unit , but turns out to be a bit of a dud .
i is interested in this gps for a long time , i waited just for the right time to buy it after reading all the great reviews on the cnet  .
i am not going to go in details about the pros because it has been mentioned in the previous reviews but the i usually park my car in a garage and when i turn on the nuvi , it took a full 10 minutes and 20 times around the block to pick up a signal i put in the restriction of avoiding toll routes , but it still lead me on a tolled route when i know for a fact that theres is an untolled route out there when i went to nj to visit my friend , it is great on the way there , but on the way back , the navigation blanked out and calculated a route for me to take to go back to virginia when i live in ny sometimes when i follow the navi's directions , it will suddently recalculate to and give me another direction  .
very confusing there isnt any detour option or road block  .
based on other reviews , i had similar positive experience out of the box until unit would not turn back on  .
called garmin , after 20 minutes on hold , they were guick to agree my unit is defective and offered to arrange repair under warantee  .
i opted to return to on    line store (shipdog  .
com) who is quick to respond with return authorization  .
will give it one more try as i seem to be an isolated case based on user reviews  .
maps were good , but as you might expect , not up to date in areas of new constuction  .
i had not fully researched how often garmin updates and policy to obtain updated maps yet  .
other than defective unit , my only two complaints were that some routes left you scratching your head as not at all what you would select from reading a map and not ideal at all  .
recalculate function corrected pretty well to route you were taking , but no ability to save the preferred route when you would take it again  .
the second complaint is that maps would add side detail , then not list names of roads  .
so , i knew where the parks , lakes , malls , golf courses where , but not the names of the major roads near and across my route  .
did not have functioning unit well long enough to explore settings and map displays to see if this is correctable  .
my rating would have been higher , had the unit not died on me .
pretty fast acquiring signal and calculating route  .
but not much other than that  .
bluetooth worked for about a week , poi database not accurate , had to return it .
having used a tom tom 1 i would rate this garmin way behind as navigation aid  .
after calling tech support is informed that poi only show in 2d view  .
you are unable to zoom in enough to discern the icon when a cluster appears  .
i could have saved $$$$$ if i had only selected the tom tom 1 that a friend let me use  .
don't assume all gps work alike  .
i too had read reviews but if your going cross country do not waste your money  .
reset does not work  .
the advertising is false  .
the mp3 player will not broadcast on an fm channel  .
the unit will only hold a few files , and jpg files take away music file space the blue tooth option would not even set up the software had bugs and i had spend fours with garmin tech support to get the unit working , and had to download files to get it going  .
it is advertised as bluetooth compatilbe , but when i tried to buy the option directly from garmin tech support , i could not find out if i need a seperate mike for the phone input or now if one gets off main highways , the unit gets lost  .
there is no correction methods by gamin  .
if a bad map is there with many mistakes , there is no way to update the first time i tried it to navigate from my home which is on a state hwy , it took me over every pig trail nearby , when in the fast or close mode  .
one pig trail crossed a creek with no bridge it has turns in the state highway which have never been there gps data from google earth is up to date , yet the gps data loaded into the device does not match  .
the location is off by as much as a mile in some places all the time , so it is not the gps satellite fault my only reason for keeping this unit is that i will be charged a 10 per cent restocking fee for a return , plus shipping , and yet the  .
average consumer seems to put up with this bad quality , so i probably cannot find one any better i pray that it will at least be accurate on interstates and old established cities , so that i can navigate my rv and show trailer to shows without falling into a creek the avoidance options are a joke  .
the unit does not avoid dirt roads that have been that way for 50 years , and are marked on the most simple road maps and by google earth as dangerous the only plus factor is that if i do not plan a route , i can see the cross streets coming up on the screen so i can read a road map and not have to look for street signs in the dark of the night and one last fault  .
the method of entering a rating on this poor unit is poor  .
not use friendly .
bottom line , this is an electronic map with out of date maps  .
no excuse for this one       they have current maps and should available as free download  .
it's a compass that cannot tell north from south .
not worth it    confuses , no accuracy , take longer time than other maps my recent purchase of 360 gives me pain than benefit , it never gives better route (fastest and shortest) that provided by google or live maps and it take longer time to reach places  .
i is traveling from kingston ontario to # fairstreet , oneonta , ny , where this devise took me to different highways and local road (faster mode) which i have waisted an hour compare to live and google maps  .
it also doesnt know how to reroute the routes , during my trip from oneonta to philadelphia one of the locals road is blocked which is the only one route (according to nuvi) that can take me to the highway , it give me wrong directions that it asked me to go to different roads that all eventually comes back in the same place where the road is blocked , i had to drive 40 minutes to find a town where the local people guides me to the highway which nuvi didnt know  .
i noticed it cant give the direction fast when a point where highway/road is divided in to different routes from a single road or highway  .
my search for a closest home depot gives me following where i couldnt find a home depot when i is in westwood , nj  .
home depot , 577 winters ave , paramus , nj my opinion get the map from internet and relay on that more than this , i trusted the reviews when i bought this but now i think it is a marketing strategy where they paid to write the review .
i ordered the garmin 360 based on reviews of the 350 for my husband's birthday  .
it arrived and he opened it  .
he actually read the instructions first    he then turned it on and chose language etc  .
the first thing you notice is that the manual is for the 310/360  .
the instructions did not match up with the accessories that were included in the box  .
so they did not update it so great , well it is made in taiwan  .
but when he went to put it on again , it is deader than a door nail  .
we called tech support and were blown off  .
nasty    really third rate won't give out last names  .
we gave then ours  .
jack could not be found when we called back  .
no email addresses for supervisor  .
why do they hide  .
called corporate put into voice mail  .
bet you can count on them for service after the return time to amazon  .
we will follow up    glutton for punishment asked for replacement .

I love that the female American voice sounds annoyed when I don't make the turn that I'm told to. :-). Small size, I use a friction mount &#38; I can hide that under the seat &#38; throw the unit itself in my purse.. Easy to use with many poi's loade; If I'm making frequent turns, I keep the 360 on text instead of the map. The reason? There's no arrow on the map showing you the direction of your next turn. So I read the text to see if I have to go right or left, especially when traffic is heavy.
