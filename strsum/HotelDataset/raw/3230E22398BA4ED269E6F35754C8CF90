although it is a bit inconvenient for people traveling by air ( williamsburg is approximately an hour from the richmond airport ) , it is a delight place to stay .
i asked for a quiet room in one of the newer guesthouses when i arrived and was assigned a corner king room in one of the newer guesthouses .
the numbering and signage was a bit confusing , but once i found my room i was delighted .
it had three windows ( two on one side and one on the other ) and i like light .
the view of the parking lot was n't spectacular , but the room was quiet and i was n't going to spend all day in the room .
both the room and bathroom were quite spacious .
and it was quiet-as promised .
my major gripe relates to the lack of sufficient plug ins for electronic devices .
i had to crawl under the desk to plug in my laptop and the plug in for charging my ipad and iphone ( fortunately that plug in can charge two devices at once because there were only two plugs free ) .
i looked behind the nightstand and both available plugs were filled with the light and clock .
i 've stayed in many hotels that have a panel at desktop level or outlets at the bottom of the desk lamp where you can plug in electronics .
staff were friendly and very helpful , and even told me which cab company had a cheaper flat rate . . .
