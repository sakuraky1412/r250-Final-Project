 in fact, the entire navigation structure has been completely revised ,  i'm still getting used to it but it's a huge step forward .

navigation is a huge improvement .

 clearly, amazon was hard at work to make navigation quicker and easier .

 i tried out the free 14 day trial on newspaper downloads, what a great way to get your news,  no advertising distractions, easy to navigate and automatically downloaded every day .

 once i got used to it, the navigation was easy too .

 the sony store is cumbersome to navigate, and slow .

despite the lighter text, i prefer the k2 for its thinness and its improved navigation and i use if far more than my k1 .

 on the kindle, you have wireless delivery, easy navigation, no ads, no need to flip to page d17 and find the place where you left off .

the main issue i had with kindle 1 was the navigation button design and placement .

 it is easy to navigate without any risk of accidentally changing the page i'm on .

 the home page is easier to navigate .

 it lets you quickly navigate periodicals ,  moving to the next article with just a click right or left, or up to the section or article list with a flick up or down .

 losing the side cursor gives kindle 2 a cleaner look ,  but it's the greatly improved navigation that's the real benefit .

 this ease of navigation is one of the most compelling new features of kindle 2 for me .

 the problem with kindle and i expect e, readers is that while amazon is asking the book publishers to adhere to a standard of navigation to support these features, amazon does not have the manpower to review each book submitted to see if its been published to their specification .

 amazon claim's it's only 20% faster, but it feels almost twice as fast ,  and the menus are much better organized and easier to navigate .

 the pictures were crisp and clear, and it was a quick learning curve to navigate between pages, articles, and sections .

 the controls are well placed, and the procedures for navigation are easy to learn .

 easy to read, navigate, etc .

the 5 way navigator is easily worth mentioning .

 it makes navigating much easier .

 the navigation stick works much better than i expected .

0 out of 5 stars significant improvements to ergonomics and navigation, february 24, 2009

there are several on, screen navigation improvements due to faster e, ink :

the kindle 1 roller button and quirky silver navigation bar are gone .

there is a new 5, way navigation toggle for left, right, up, down plus  press  .

i'm generally enjoying these navigation changes .

 it is significantly easier to hold and to navigate relative to the kindle 1 .

 this is a beautiful little product  it feels sleek and sturdy and   booklike in my hands, the controls are finally where they ought to be and the navigation interface is intuitive and easy to learn .

 as advertised, it is very easy on the eyes, combined with font sizing and easy navigation this does what it was meant to do .

some pdfs' tables of contents did work as a navigable set of links .

for typing and navigating, the e, ink technology takes patience and a little getting used to , ,  especially for frenetic folks in task mode .

 1 the ink takes a moment to display on the screen after your input from the keyboard or navigation contoller  2 the keyboard input is stiff and requires a direct punch on the very tiny keys to register  3 the keyboard is so close to the bottom of the unit, and the kindle is so flexible, typing is something of a laborious or even tortured action for relatively short notes such as this paragraph actually written on the kindle 2 .

navigation is much easier with the 5, way button .

 there can be occassional minor  ghosting  problems where the screen does not completely update on a page turn or when navigating .

 i realize the k1 did not have this either, but it sure would be easier to touch the places you want to navigate than use the joystick .

 instead, it displays the book title and there is no way to navigate to the last page read .

 the fastest way to navigate through a larger work   would be to leave your page, go to the table of contents and choose the most likely chapter and then proceed page by page from there till you reach your desired page .

 as mentioned above, the free copies also do not have active table of contents, so navigation is well near impossible beyond simply ploughing through form start to finish, which is what i did .

 again navigation is by using the next and previous page buttons .

i think in most areas the kindle 2 has met expectations, but a sluggish cursor, poor navigation and almost non, existent capability to organize content are major drawbacks .

 the largest difference was the touch screen at the bottom, but once you're doing the primary thing that e, readers do   it becomes a non, issue, as it's only for navigation .

 it's actually slightly more awkward to navigate using the touch screen because you have to look between both screens, whereas with the kindle you just use the directional rocker in the planned direction .

the kindle is really fun to use and i'm having a blast learning to navigate it and how to use all its features .

 i find navigating the device page turns, menus, etc .

i also found using the navigation button difficult .

 i have some more to learn about searching and navigating, but if an old geezer like me can do it, anybody can .

>> far better navigation between articles in periodicals, and easier navigation overall with its five, way controller replacing the k1's clumsy and time, consuming navigation wheel and cursor

 the new navigation button works well, and the keyboard   feels good to my fingers .

the thumb stick navigation on the kindle takes some getting used to, especially those who use touch screens or mice everyday .

3 easy page turns and navigation .

 navigating the menu is almost intuitive and becomes easier and easier as you go .

 the buttons work well even with my large fingers and the navigating 5, position control is easily mastered and easy to use effectively .

 i find it easier to have it in hand than navigating through the on, screen version .

 the pages are easy to flip, the menu is easy to navigate, and it is easy to forget that you are not reading a  real  book !

 the screen reads like paper, it is easy to navigate .

 i find myself reading faster, because the text is more readable for me, and the navigation through the book is so very easy .

 i couldn't imagine trying to navigate internet pages without it .

 i really enjoy the menu button and the 5, way controller to navigate .

i found the screen readability and overall user experience of navigating the device to be excellent .

i found the kindle store to be full featured and easy to navigate, and was impressed that you even have the ability to write book reviews directly from the device .

 the buttons on the k2 are not easily pressed while reading, and i love the 5, way button that allows me to easily navigate between my newpaper pages   .

i was worried about navigation without the scroll wheel, but find it much easier to use and it is more productive and faster to use the new navigation .
