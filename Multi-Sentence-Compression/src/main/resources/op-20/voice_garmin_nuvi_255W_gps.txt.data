VOICE ACTIVATION DID STOP WORKING & THEN CAME BACK IN GERMAN ,  JUST CHANGED IT BACK ENGLISH & HAS BEEN WORKING WELL SINCE THEN .
Voice commands were mechanical but clear .
The voices seem too robotic .
You have your choice of several languages and voices .
However, I much prefer robotic voices to no spoken directions at all .
From reviews, I thought there might only be one voice .
The text, to, speech is very good, with very clear voices .
0 out of 5 stars No Jill voice on this one !
It seems that the female voices do not distort quite as much as the male voices .
Some of the voices are annoying .
Several voice options will announce both directions and street names, etc .
The non TTS voice is more pleasant .
The 750 sounds more like a real female voice, where the 255w sounds more robotic .
There are different voices you can choose to give you your directions, even Australian, American and British English .
The voice is annoying as heck too, no personality .
The voice directions are great, but sometimes it mispronounces names .
Everybody said the same thing, great unit, but poor voice in the TTS mode .
I didn't have the problems with the sounds of the voices like others have .
The voice commands are excellent and timely .
And the voice and streets match perfectly .
