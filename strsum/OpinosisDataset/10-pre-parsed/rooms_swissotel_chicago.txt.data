great hotel with great rooms .

rooms in similar hotels would usually be about $250, 300 .

rooms were nicely furnished .

rooms in this hotel are noisy though .

rooms are dated, our corner room's bathroom was shabby .

great location nice rooms loved the swissotel !

rooms at the hotel are getting somewhat tired .

strange, we thought, since we had booked conceirge level rooms .

got to hotel, rooms weren't ready yet .

rooms were good, nothing spectacular about them except the views .
