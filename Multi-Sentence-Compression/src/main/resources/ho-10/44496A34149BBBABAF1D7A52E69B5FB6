generally hotels in the heart of chester are super-expensive in the summer but we got a great deal at crowne plaza ( better when you book early ) and even got upgraded to a club king room which provided you complimentary drinks in the bar between 5pm – 8pm every evening which was nice .
my only complaint was on the day of our departure as we were guaranteed a late checkout at 2:00pm but housekeeping came knocking after we returned from breakfast and again at 12:30pm just as we were minutes away from checking out anyway .
we were early into chester so our room was not yet ready so we left to explore the city and returned some hours later .
there were special spa vouchers in the lobby and was able to use it to get 10 % off a treatment .
the only thing is that the spa is outsourced and it seemed that only one lady was doing all of the treatments so you didn’t have a pick of time slots or flexibility with your treatment .
she was really good though but i can’t help but think that a proper and staffed spa would be success here , especially catering to weary travelers !
tom was apologetic for this and promptly brought them up to the room along with a lovely box of cadbury chocolates with an apology for the mix up .
the hotel’s main entrance is covered , dark and feels like the back of a parking garage but it is in a prime location just steps to watergate street and the heart of the city .
but overall and despite this little hiccup , we had a great stay !
the agent who checked us in ( tom ) was super-efficient and very helpful during our stay .
