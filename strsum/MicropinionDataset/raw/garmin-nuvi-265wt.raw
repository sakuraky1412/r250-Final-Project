Pros:. Came with all accessories needed..car charger/traffic receiver, USB cord, Mounting bracket. It does everything you could ever need and never really needed to read manual much at all. VERY user friendly!!!. 
Cons:. The only way this thing could have been better is if it were free!. 
Summary:. Good routes and re-calculating if you make a wrong turn....Voice directions good and clear...Bluetooth works great with my I-Phone...Haven't tried the traffic receiver yet...will be using that in the am...... I bought the refurbished 265WT for only $119 with full one year warranty...couldn't be happier!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is a very detailed GPS!. 
Cons:. It needs more maps.. 
Summary:. I bought it from here: http://www.garmin-nuvi-265wt.com/. I was surprised by the price tag they had when I bought it. It's a very great product! It is the best GPS I have ever had! Definitely a must-have for everybody!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and customize. You can even load in your own Points of Interest or "POIs." I have the Red Light Cam, Speed Cam and Speed Trap file loaded in mine so no more tickets here! Best feature though: SUPER fast satellite acquisition!. 
Cons:. The cost to upgrade your maps is outrageous at $69 every time you want to update them. They give you 60 days after you buy the GPS to update the maps for free but of course, I forgot so I'm screwed now unless I pay them another $69 :-(. 
Summary:. You won't be disappointed with this GPS. I got mine on "Black Friday" last year from TigerDirect.com and I only paid $159 total with tax and shipping included which was great! I don't think it's on sale there anymore but it might still be pretty cheap. They've been going down in price over the past few months everywhere and I've seen them as low as about $175. It's easily worth $300 so anything under that is totally worth it. The SD card slot is great too... it comes with 2GB of internal memory with about 600 MB free after they add the maps to it so having the option to add another 8GB for your own software (red light cams, etc.) is great!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast navigation. Large display screen. Bluetooth for hands free use. FM Traffic works great.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. This is my third GPS system. I spent a little more this time and it really paid off! The "Where Am I" feature is fast and accurate. I wish I had purchased a model like this sooner.. 

$$;
Pros:. HUGE screen makes it easy to read. Bluetooth is crystal clear. Free traffic. The "Where Am I" feature is the best! Announces names of streets. Great volume. Works with my iPhone. Very easy menu. FM Traffic is excellent.. 
Cons:. Power cable could be a bit longer for my SUV.. 
Summary:. Just received the Garmin 265WT for Christmas. What a gift! I love the BIG screen. The announcments are clear and on time. Much faster than my TOM TOM. I recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. The life-time traffic info rerouting is a big plus. I find the traffic warnings/instructions timely, and like the "where am I?" and the "pedestrian" features and the Garmin portable friction dashboard mount.. 
Cons:. The computer voice could be better but is acceptable.. 
Summary:. This is my first nav system and I recommend to anyone without hesitation. It is a budget minded nav system with many features.. Last week I drove from Michigan to Florida and back over two thousand miles. Three times Garmin 265wt saved mes: 1. Late at night going to a hotel near the Great Smokey Mountain, the highway was closed. Garmin rerouted using local roads and got to the hotel without any trouble. 2. Facing the afternoon traffic jam at Cincinnati, Garmin rerouted using local roads and got back on the highway 6 miles further up bypassing the jam. 3. Late at night in Southeastern Michigan, highway was closed due to an accident, not detected by Garmin, I existed the highway and used local roads going further north forcing Garmin to reroute. With Garmin?s reroute, I got back on I-75 two miles north from the accident site after a short delay.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lot's of features and very easy to use, I mean VERY easy to use! I've been playing with this locally to understand it's logic and any operation glitches.. 
Cons:. It's not 100% perfect and sometimes it doesn't take the route that I think is best, but who am I and is there such a thing as perfect? :) It'll miss the addresses by a couple houses, but it gets me were I need to go.. 
Summary:. Bottom line is it will get you were you want to go much better than a map, it's easy to use, and I couldn't have ask for anything better (even if money was no object). It may not put you in the driveway or parking lot your looking for, but if you need that much help, well, you can figure the rest of that statement out.. I don't live in an area with traffic reports, but you better believe when I am in Tampa in a couple weeks I'll be trying it out!. Buy this unit! I got it for $260 (after some 'negotiations' with the store, and it has been worth every single cent!. 

$$;
Pros:. Widescreen; Free traffic for life; Bluetooth Speaker; Sleek and slim. 
Cons:. FM Traffic Transmitter wire is a bit thick making it too big to be hidden underneath your dashboard. 
Summary:. I love the nuvi 265wt. I have used the GPS on my iPhone for awhile but it isn't reliable or practical to use on long car trips.. This is my first GPS. After researching for awhile I decided on the 265wt. I really didn't want to spend more than $200 on a GPS but after seeing that traffic is included free for life, normally $60, and that a Bluetooth speaker is included, which I was looking to purchase as well and normally cost $70-100, I decided on the nuvi 265wt. I purchased it from a reputable buyer on eBay for $300 plus s&#38;h.. I love the widescreen. The fact that it says the street names is great (the voice is a little robot-like but you get over it quick). The frame rate is pretty good. It's a good beginner GPS because it's very easy to use. Everything is self explanatory.. I do have a gripe with Garmin's customer service. I called up because I thought the traffic wasn't working (it was working fine...it was just my own stupidity that made me not realize it) and a person answered. I thought "wow! a person right away!" She asked me how she can direct my call and I told her I thought I was having a technical issue and she put me on hold and connected me to a computer with a series of voice prompts. Press 1 to purchase...press 2 for technical support. After I went through the prompts my call was answered quickly but still...why ask me how you can direct my call if you're just going to make me go through a bunch of computer options anyway? Not a big deal but it just irked me.. In conclusion the Garmin nuvi 265wt is a GREAT GPS system. Especially for first time buyers that want a lot of features without taking a big chunk out of their wallet.. Updated. on Oct 29, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Bought new--Updated per instructions. and Wham---right out the box--Loaded.. Very nice on the Road-- Loud enough to hear-the turns. Great Display. 
Cons:. Can't find my address.!! Finds my neighbors--1/2 mile up the street but My address does not exist. Tested on 2-road trips after Up-dates--and can not find places that have been there--25 years.. 1/2 Mile away--every time... 
Summary:. Me or the Satellite---needs to Move--. in order for it to be More Accurate and BTW--- Traffic Updates are "Not Happening"--on country Highways.. but may work great on Freeways-(un-tested).. Its easy to Operate---Easy to Up-date---Loud enough to hear the Spoken Directions--Fast to pick up directions on turns and "make adjustments"--if you choose to go a different route then it wants you too... Overall---in 98% Happy with the Product--and it is reasonably Priced... 

$$;
Pros:. -HotFix feature works pretty well. -Big, vivid screen. -Quick recalculations. -Free FM traffic notifications. -Automatic brightness adjuster. -Decent signal reception. 
Cons:. -Points of interests didn't have the theater that I usually go to and my high school (they were both built about 3-4 years ago). -Seems to have an apparent liking to my local toll roads. -Hands-free calling quality is so-so. 
Summary:. One day, I decided to tap in a location across town (just to test it out) and it told me to use the toll roads even though the local streets to get there were right there!. Even though it has some minor problems, I still would recommend this great navigation system for "GPS newbies".. Got the nï¿½vi 265WT for $200 at Costco using a $20 off coupon.. 

$$;
Pros:. -I have big hands and am more than able to navigate the screen and press all the buttons. -Beautiful. -Fits in your pocket. -Comes loaded. -Best GPS under $500. 
Cons:. Few seconds late on turn directions :\ so you might have to do the speed limit !!!!!. 
Summary:. AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Blue Tooth works well. FM Traffic is spot on. I have downloaded all of the updates and my unit works fine. Used it yesterday and the recaculating function worked flawlessly and within seconds of deviating from the GPS plotted course.. 
Cons:. The power cable could be longer. I would like to put the wire in such a way as to mostly hide it from view.. 
Summary:. I've recommended this GPS to several friends and and colleagues and they have experienced the same results I have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use - intuitive layout and operation. "Where am I" feature. Traffic feature. Voice prompts timely and accurate. Bluetooth connection easy to set up and easy to use. Detour feature.. 
Cons:. Sound quality of speaker limits usefulness of the bluetooth feature - hard to hear at highway speeds. Dash mounting pad won't stay stuck (maybe because I was trying to stick it in 10 degree weather).. 
Summary:. Have had the product for about two weeks. I love it thus far. Have taken on two road trips and it has operated flawlessly with the minor gripe of the speaker quality for bluetooth use. A lot of features for the $, especially when compared to the nuvi 650 I bought a year ago for more money. I have now give one to each of my two driving kids.. 

$$;
Pros:. Directions are accurate, easy to use, spoken directions, big screen, fits in my pocket.. 
Cons:. Acquiring satellites. 
Summary:. I used this GPS for a couple weeks on my regular commute and just took one long trip with it to a place I'd never been. The directions were accurate, and it adapted fairly quickly when I purposely chose a parallel road to avoid traffic. I love the big, clear screen. Very easy to use.. Spoken directions are clear and usually very good. If there are two quick turns in a row, it does not always give enough notice.. Points of interest were up-to-date, even in remote rural areas.. The traffic was as helpful as any internet traffic site - not at all. But it's free, and the problem lies with the traffic source, not the GPS.. The only con is the startup time. You must be sitting still and with a clear view of the sky for it to find a satellite. It does not work in my parking spot (in an alleyway). It does not work in very slow moving traffic - you need to pull over and actually stop for 1 minute or so.. Overall - very happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, display is easy to read, Free FM traffic is a great feature. 
Cons:. FM traffic requires 12v adapter to be plugged in. I agree with other reviewer that the cable is alittle too thick. Bluetooth phone call was not as good as I expected.. 
Summary:. I've only had the unit for a few days, and I really like it. It's my first GPS. I drive 90 miles a day to work on some of the most congested freeways in Los Angeles and so far this unit has been very helpful. Bluetooth was a little distorted on one of two tests. Could have been phone signal. But I still recommend it. Good feature to cost ratio.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy of use. accurate. fast reroutes. 
Cons:. bluetooth with our phones was terrible. 
Summary:. I wouls save the $ &#38; get the 255wt which I believe has everything except the bluetooth option. 

$$;
Pros:. Handsfree Bluetooth phone integration--awesome with an iPhone; Easy to use; Can import custom POI files. 
Cons:. Not as easy to manage multiple waypoints in a route, or see various upcoming POIs (such as all POIs at the next highway exit)-- unless I haven't figured it out yet (the user manual is a bit lacking too).. 
Summary:. With an iPhone's built-in GPS, one wouldn't think a dedicated GPS device would still be necessary, but this little Garmin is an excellent companion device for providing voice-aided turn-by-turn navigation, as well as being an excellent hands-free calling device. On a recent trip, I had my iPhone playing music through my car stereo and connected to the Garmin via bluetooth. When a call came in, I was able to see my iPhone's caller ID directly on the Garmin, answer &#38; talk hands-free. During the time I was on the phone, the iPhone was smart enough to pause &#38; resume the music automatically-- how cool is that?!! Another nice feature is being able to search for a POI and call the business directly from the Garmin. It also displays my iPhone's full contact list, battery status, and cell signal strength-- all with a nice-sized screen that's easier to read while driving than fumbling around to look at the phone itself.. I purchased my nuvi 265wt at Wal-Mart online and a beanbag-type friction mount came with it for free-- works great for using the Garmin in multiple vehicles and rental cars!. 

$$;
Pros:. Widescreen display, ease of functionality, compact size, very accurate.. 
Cons:. Lifetime traffic alerts are advertising-driven (not too intrusive, though), power cord (which has FM traffic receiver on it) way too long (IMO), "up-to-date" map database does not have my 5-year old subdivision on it.. 
Summary:. Even though I totally did not have any realistic need for it, I bought the 265WT because I read good things about it, and the price was reasonable for what you get (and I am a gadget freak). Right out of the box, the 265WT is pretty much ready to go (you have to initialize the GPS outdoors for about 3 minutes or so when you power it up for the first time). It comes with everything you need to get up and running (power cord with inline FM traffic alert receiver, windshield mount, etc.).. I live in an apartment complex that has been around since about 2004, and the most up-to-date map database doesn't have any part of it. Not that any of that matters, as I can usually find my way home. Every other function is straight forward. Living in Omaha, there is usually no traffic to speak of, so the traffic alerts don't mean too much to me while I am roaming around locally. In addition to mapping, this unit also calculates your speed and can be used as a bona fide trip computer, measuring distance traveled, max speed, fuel cost (you input the current local gas prices), length of time stopped, etc., all of which is very accurate. One of the neatest features is the "where am I" function, which displays the nearest intersection to your location, and also shows the closest gas stations, hospitals, and police stations. This unit stows away in a pocket, purse, or bag, and you can electronically password-lock the unit so it would be useless if it were stolen. Everything else is self-explanatory with the 265WT and I highly recommend it.. Updated. on Dec 19, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Great LCD screen with easy to read display, Bluetooth, traffic receiver included. 
Cons:. Map data not up to date, 2-year old data needs to be deleted. 
Summary:. The Garmin nï¿½vi 265WT is your basic GPS but loaded with features that are normally found in more expensive units.. It works great right out of the box. On its main display, you can view your vehicle's speed, map of where you're going, arrival time, next turn, etc.. The included bluetooth and traffic receiver are valuable add-ons that are costly when added to a unit. The traffic receiver is usually around $100 just for this one option!. Only complaint with the unit is its mapping software update. It needs to be more current. For example, I found several movie theaters that closed 2 years earlier that are still listed as points of interest. Of course, if you just have to have the latest map, Garmin can accommodate you for the rip off price of $100.. The nï¿½vi 265WT is a real bargain in a GPS. Sure, you can buy a GPS for less money, but not with all the bells and whistles found in this one!. 

$$;
Pros:. HotFix Feature works well; near-instant route recalculation; traffic info well displayed. 
Cons:. Bluetooth Speakerphone could be much better. 
Summary:. I just purchased this unit from my local costco and have found it to be one of the best GPS units I have ever used. Out of the box, from a full cold start, it found its location accurately within 20 seconds or so (most units I have seen before take a few minutes). Garmin's new HotFix feature actually works as advertised. Whenever I emerge from a signal dead zone (like a parking garage) the unit finds itself almost immediately. My old Magellan would take at least a minute, if not several to do so.. Also this unit has amazingly fast route recalculation response time. I purposefully drove against its directions and it realized and had a new route with a new direction within 5 seconds or less. Again my old Magellan would take about 30 seconds to a minute to recalculate (taking about 10 seconds just to realize I had gone the wrong way).. The user interface is also very intuitive and easy to navigate. The features are great. EcoRoute actually gives me usual information, providing estimates of my fuel consumption and and even costs incurred, all based on my vehicle type, fuel type, gas mileage, and its tracking data.. The only issue I have had so far is that the Bluetooth Speakerphone on this unit has so far been only satisfactory. Most calls have been intelligible, but I often get told that I can just barely be understood. I am working on finding a better placement in my car to mitigate this issue.. For the money, this is probably one of your best bets for GPS at the moment.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very legible. Good turn by turn audio. Traffic alerts decent in major cities. Very good off highway routing.. 
Cons:. Traffic alerts a little slow and inaccurate at times. Doesnt always give you the best routing plot when freeways are concerned.. 
Summary:. Saved my butt on numerous occasions. Very happy with purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. User friendly, simple to use, various languages available.. 
Cons:. Day/night - bright/low light feature not as good as Nuvi 260W owned previously.. Marginal voice/microphone quality when bluetooth feature used in conjuction with cell phone.. 
Summary:. Upgraded from 260W for unit with bluetooth but disappointed with quality of sound and microphone. Volume adjustment should be mounted on the outside of the unit rather than on touch screen. HotFix keeps shutting off the unit here and there unexpectidly although it automatically turns back on. Good selection of foreign languages with option to download more. Excellent Garmin factory support, as always. POIs and addresss can easily be downloaded from Google Maps. Overall good value for the money spent.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear pictures. Friendly user buttons. 
Cons:. Traffic not effective yet in Montreal Canada. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS ever. Was going to buy the 360 but the sales rep said it was discontinued and suggested the 265T series. The wider screen was more appealing to me. Found it on Ebay and the seller was in my living town. What a coincidance. I was able to save on S and H fees. SP bought it for 300$ an excellent price. I loved this product right away. Easy to use. The text to speech feature is unbelievable. When you go off track, it quickly recalculates your new route. On the off side, the traffic component is stll not available in Montreal (should be available in 2009). Also when using phone through the unnit, the caller finds that the voice does not look so clear.. So great buy for the price. Do not hesitate to buy this unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Worth the money. 
Cons:. Blue tooth a little garbled. 

$$;
Pros:. free traffic, blue tooth. 
Cons:. pop up ads. 
Summary:. for the price a very easy to use GPS system. 

$$;
Pros:. Best bang for the buck. got it at Costco for $169. Very viewable and easy to use. Traffic did take a bit to initiate.. 
Cons:. Experienced a horizontal line across the screen after about 1 week of usage. Hard reset didn't resolve, so exchanged unit.. 
Summary:. Outstanding unit for the price, and much better than some comparable units. Bluetooth capability is a key factor and many units higher priced don't have this capability.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide screen, traffic, speed of calculation.. 
Cons:. Blue tooth doesn't work with all phones and you don't find out till after you buy it. Speed limits aren't always correct. No compass on main screen. I miss the fact that it plugged in automatically when you snapped it in place on the older models.. 
Summary:. So far I like it for what it does do but it doesn't do one of the main features I bought it for, which is the bluetooth phone hook up.It is only compatible with certain phones and you don't find this out before you buy the unit. In the past all my phones worked sucessfully with any bluetooth device I bought. I took it for granted that this device would work also. I was wrong. The traffic seems to work OK but I haven't had any experiences where it saved me from a jam as of yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good voice directions. Adaquate display and easy to read.. 
Cons:. Don't velcro the unit to the dash - leave room for the antenna to see otherwise the internal antenna will loose reception. Power wire is bulky and hard to keep in place.. 
Summary:. Good unit once you get used to it. Lifetime traffic a plus although it is slow to react to changing situations. Route recalculations were fairly quick and gave satisfactory results. The sound should not be at full volume because it will clip the amplifier and cause unintelligable speech. Keep it at 90 or below. I would recommend this unit especially if you get it on sale.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up, easy to view screen, great volume and fast recalculations.. 
Cons:. Turn announcements needs to be a little sooner.. 
Summary:. I found when using this model in a large city with multi-lane interstates, the turn announcements would not arrive soon enough for me to make needed lane changes at times. If the announcements would arrive sooner I would be totally happy with this model. Outside of this problem and when used under less congested conditions (multi-lanes and speeds over 65 mph) I would give 5 stars!. 

$$;
Pros:. nice big screen and turns called out by street name very helpful. 
Cons:. speaker for the blue tooth is not to clear when you turn the volume up. 
Summary:. if you purchase this for the nav then it is a good deal but do not get your hopes up if you plan on using it as a hands free device for your phone. 

$$;
Pros:. Got this gps as a christmas gift. ORIGINALLY OWNED THE STREET PILOT 340 ALSO A GREAT PRODUCT. THE 285WT SLIM DESIGN IS GREAT. SCREEN IS A GOOD SIZE AND GRAPHICS ARE VERY CLEAR. 
Cons:. FIRST UNIT WAS RETURNED AS IT CONTINUOUSLY LOCKED UP AND AND KEPT LOOSING THE DIRECTIONAL VOICE RETURNED IT FOR THE SAME MODEL` ...... 
Summary:. THE SAME ISSUE WITH THE SECOND ONE. FINALLY CALLED GARMIN AND DISCOVERED THAT THE ISSUE WAS WITH THE BLUETOOTH. THE PHONE I HAPPEN TO HAVE IS NOT COMP[ATIBLE WITH THIS UNIT. GPS IS GREAT AS LONG AS I DONT USE THE BLUETOOTH. HAVENT TRIED USING IT WITH A COMPATIBLE PHONE.(GARMING PROVIDES A COMPATIUBLE PHONE LIST ON ITS SITE) ANYWAY THAT SEEMED TO SOLVE THE LOCKING UP ISSUE. GPS WORKS GREAT AS LONG AS THE BLUETOOTH IS DISABLED.. I WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED TO KNOW IF THE OTHER REVIEWERS THAT EXPERIENCE THIS SAME ISSUE TRIED DISABLEING BLUETOOTH OR HAVE A COMPATIBLE PHONE?BOTTOMS LINE IS THE GPS IS GREAT AS LONG AS I DONT PAIR IT WITH THE PHONE I CURRENTLY HAVE SO I GUESS IM BACK TO MY OLD HEAD SET. LOVE THE DESIGN . STILL FIGUREING OUT THE TRAFFIC FEATURE, ASIDE FROM THIS IM PRETTY SATISFIED. GARMIN CUSTOMER SEVICE ARE VERY HELPFUL.. Updated. on Jan 15, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use right out of the box, clear GPS directions, traffic feature is nice. 
Cons:. bluetooh feature is cumbersome. 
Summary:. Pulled it right out of the box, turned it on and started using it immediately. Very intuitive, just the way I like gadgets. Probably the most usefule feature for me is the 'points of interest'. You can find just about any store in any city. It's great, I use it even in my hometown! On the negative side, I wish there was a volume dial on the unit. It's annoying to have to push two or three buttons to adjust the volume, esp during a bluetooth call. The whole point of bluetooth is handsfree, right? If I have to fiddle with my hands to adjust volume, what's the point? Also, it's a pain to disconnect the bluetooth. That's about 5 button presses... That, and the fact that car phones never sound great anyway... I just don't use the bluetooth feature unless I have to. Other than that, I really like the unit and am very happy with the purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. GPS features are quite good. Touch screen works well, if a little sluggish. Points of interest are generally accurate, though you might want to update the map periodically (businesses do close!). 
Cons:. Traffic feature is comically bad, and totally useless. "Traffic ahead!!!" when there is none, nothing when an 18 wheeler is dashed across the road. I'm better off with the radio.. 
Summary:. Decent product. Durable, and no major problems after 8 months of use.. 

$$;
Pros:. The touchscreen rocks! It may be a little slow, but I have fat fingers that didn't seem to fase it a bit. Very easy to know what your doing and not get lost in a bunch of sub-menus.. 
Cons:. The bluetooth, okay.. so I bought this model specifically for the bluetooth feature, don't you make that same mistake. The speaker is way too quiet to hear anything and the microphone is, well, garbage. Basically it's a glorified caller-id box!. 
Summary:. Bottom line, good GPS unit with alot of cool features and downloads.. 

$$;
Pros:. Minus the TRAGIC shut down errors, potentially a fabulous thing to have in your car. I love that it will tell me the nearest gas station, or shop, &#38; showed timesaving route for commute to work. Haven't quite figured out FMtraffic thing.. 
Cons:. Don't know if cloud cover/preciptation responsible but this device started shutting down automatically - and frequently on its inaugural roadtrip, requiring reboot and reentering of information. Has latest firmware upgrade. Disappointing.. 
Summary:. The topic of gps random shutdown poses a TRAGIC roadblock to functionality - I'd been using this thing a week, was impressed, upgraded the firmware, then on its inaugural roadtrip as my husband's gift we were driving to God's country and the thing just kept shutting down - no warning and we missed turns on route. Its a complete deal breaker if this thing cr*ps out in precipitation conditions ... if that's even the problem. So far reviewing online it seems this random spontaneous shutting down of GPS is a problem with prolific references online, but no fixes, and nothing I've been able to get from Garmin. If no fix is available its back to the store!. 

$$;
Pros:. Directions are accurate and the text to speech is good. Color and screens look good. Nice looking unit and suction device worked very well.. 
Cons:. The Garmin software and computer downloads are confusing. I still have not be able to download some items. I also just bought the Tom Tom One and while it does not have the text to speech the software and downloads were extremely easy.. 
Summary:. While the Garmin unit cost me more money the Tom Tom overall is a more user friendly unit and in my opinion the interface on the screens have a better layout then the Garmin. The Tom Tom website and add on were also much friendlier. Garmin downloads were confusing and worked poorly. The website was extremely slow. Both item work well overall but my choice between the two would be the Tom Tom.. 

$$;
Pros:. The Bluetooth hands-free phone control, wide screen, traffic info receiver,lifetime ad-supported traffic reports, and the Garmin time-tested logical operator screens are major attractions.. 
Cons:. The wider screen uses smaller fonts than the narrow older screen 360 series. Key header traffic instructions are harder to read than on older units. The Track Up nav screen contains no indicator of north direction. This is a serious omission.. 
Summary:. It is hard to believe that the potential of this product is limited by the strange design decisions that resulted in reduced readability of the navigation screens and the removal of directional information that was standard on previous models. If those items are not important to the user, the Garmin 256WT can be an excellent choice at a moderate price.. 

$$;
Pros:. text to speech is helpful. maps are crisp and easy to read. gps signal is strong. 
Cons:. bluetooth is terrible - a nonstarter. traffic is never accurate - not much value. touch screen is not responsive to touch inputs. 
Summary:. overall this is a good gps system, but it doesn't offer anything of value beyond that of the 205W model, which is much cheaper. 

$$;
Pros:. It's fun to play around with.. 
Cons:. It offers the stupidest directions on how to get somewhere.. 
Summary:. I suppose this device will get you where you want to go, but it neither does so by the shortest route or the fastest time. And it often takes one needlessly out of the way. I confess that I'm befuddled about the logic programing. Beware, one needs to refer to legitimate maps when traveling somewhere unfamiliar.. 

$$;
Pros:. Traffic Receiver even though I didn't think it was that accurate.. Blue Tooth worked great.. Quick connection to satellite. 
Cons:. POI not up to date and is missing a lot... I mean a lot compared to online databases.. Maps not accurate even with the latest maps downloaded.. Rerouting is not all that great.. 
Summary:. I am a little disappointed with this GPS after after I upgraded from my old 200w . I bought it for the Traffic Receiver option. But I realized that it is one of the least important things in a GPS. The POI database was the most important to me because when I'm in a big city and I'm looking for a specific business, I can't find it most of the time. The maps and routing are not that accurate in rural areas. I've gotten lost several times using this GPS and occasionally when I enter in an address it has no idea where it is. If you miss a turn, it does not ask you to make a U turn for the quickest route. It tends to avoid U turns even if a U turns could save you 10-15 min. The maps are not that accurate and it misses the destinations sometimes by 100's of yards.. On the positive side, the Traffic receiver does work and show delays and optional routes. The blue tooth works great and better than some other GPS units I've used. It is also very quick to lock on a satellite signal.. This GPS is great if you just want to go from address A to B in big cities. But if you are looking for POI's I wouldn't recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like voice, language selection, find addresses.. 
Cons:. GPS didn't connected with my Nokia phone. Traffic infirmation doesn't work, despite Navteq on my computer indicated everything is OK. Garmin representative blamed Navteq.. 
Summary:. May be my GPS was defective, But 3 Garmin representative didn't help me and I returned product to Amazon, where I bought this GPS. Now, I am lokking more stable GPS, where will be work all components. This GPS price around $250 and not so cheap.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Handles re-routing well. Traffic info (not tested yet).. 
Cons:. Horribly out of date maps (just updated to latest maps for 2009). The maps must be years behind. Limited POI - missing lots of locations.. Sometimes, unit freezes up, voice gets completly distorted. Ad supported traffic.. 
Summary:. This is my first experience with a GPS, and I am amazed how out of date the maps are even when using the one free update to the "latest" maps. In the area where we live, it has roads that don't exist anymore, and is missing the road to our house. Google has had this on their maps for years. Also, the software quality is rather mediocre, given that on day one, we've already had to shutdown/start up the unit several times to get back full control. But when it works, it is great. Maybe we got a lemmon? We have all the latest SW and map updates. This is really surprising.. We haven't been able to test the traffic feature yet. The ads have so far been unintrusive (shown when starting up).. 

$$;
Pros:. easy menu, looks good.. 
Cons:. sooo slow to react to imput, when typing it takes a second to register the letter... reminds me of an old Motorola phone I had 5 years ago.. 
Summary:. i'm amzed this got such a good rating by cnet, it's horrible to use ... takes for ever to find an address or "point of interest" ... the real time traffic alert system is a joke feature... it comes inc but does little to nothing in updates on traffic &#38; I live in Silicon Valley.. very very disspointed ... will not by from this manufacturer again.. not being a tech guy, i'm assuming the chip is too slow to operate this gps ?. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much. Maybe it is slim and looks nice.. 
Cons:. The maps are outdated; It loses signal too easily, and left us lost; The voice prompts for both the navigation and for traffic alerts came much too late. Bottom line: This GPS is a stinker. I'm going to return it.. 
Summary:. I am disappointed with this unit. It lost signal often in Manhattan, and left me trying to figure out which turn to make, when I needed its guidance the most. The maps are out dated too. On one occasion, it guided me to a library that had been closed and relocated for over a year. I found it useless on many occasions that I used it on outings with my family. It kept getting us lost, especially when voice prompts came too late to do anything about them. I had another Garmin before this, with all the same bells and whistles, except the volume was on the outside of the unit. That made it much easier to control than going through menus.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blue Tooth,Announces Street Names. 
Cons:. mini USB on back of unit. 
Summary:. Using a competitor handheld gps for a number of years with no problems,I'm disappointed in Garmin automotive units.Returned two 880's with multiple problems,used four days and three days.One 265wt in one day with problems right out of the box.All units had multiple freeze ups and maps gone haywire.Both 880's would send me on a wild recalculated route in the opposite direction after arriving home on a highlighted route.. 

$$;
Pros:. Some nice comfort features.. 
Cons:. Wouldn't find a major highway in Phoenix, that has been there for over fifty years Reported erroneous mileage from Phoenix to Colorado Springs, Co.. 
Summary:. Worthless if it can't find the road you're on!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is simple to use and a v basic unit.. 
Cons:. Substandard shaky GPS fixing.. 
Summary:. I was given one of these units to get around LA - it was a nightmare! It would lose signal every few miles causing me to miss meetings and pull over in dangerous places! I tried reseting it etc but it was pretty useless.. 

$$;
Pros:. wide screen; easy to use; good directions. 
Cons:. turns off in mid-use while hooked to charger; won't turn back on easily - not sure what the magic combination is to get it to turn on.. 
Summary:. Bought at COSTCO less than a month ago. It turns off in mid-use while hooked to charger; won't turn back on easily - not sure what the magic combination is to get it to turn on. Have had other GARMIN GPS' never encountered this problem before. Although a friend has had the same experience with the same model from the same store.. 

$$;
Pros:. The small amount of time it did work, it was cool. The gps works sufficiently.. 
Cons:. horrible customer service. drops communication with phone frequently. 
Summary:. I called in because my garmin nuvi stopped communicating with my phone. I had already downloaded new software and applied any fixes that were available to both the phone and the garmin, but nothing worked. Since my phone works will all other bluetooth devices that I have, I figured it had to be the garmin. After being on hold for almost an hour!... a guy named Marvin answered. He literally gave me about one minute, then said he couldn't help me. When I said please don't hang up on me, he said I won't and then put me back in the queue to wait another hour! Unbelievable. The device still is not working with my phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plenty of volume. Bright display.. 
Cons:. Warnings and turns given too late. 
Summary:. After using a Magellan GPS for 5 years, I decided to replace it with a more more advanced unit. I picked the Garmin 265wt. Poor choice. The warnings for upcoming turns are given too late. The system announces the next turn when you first enter a new road (there could be 200 miles to go before the turn). It does not give you another warning until 3/10 of a mile before the turn. This is much too late at 75 miles per hour on highways. The Magellan announces at 2 miles and again at .5 miles to go. The turn instructions are also not clear. Despite being an experienced GPS user, I missed a couple of turns in the city because of the confusing display. When re-routing, the system announced turns after I had passed the intersection. There is a display that tells you how many feet left before a turn. It keeps showing 90 to 100 feet left when you are already in the intersection. It tells you that you have arrived at your destination when you are still 2 to 3 houses/buildings away.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has bluetooth for your phone but poor audio quality.. 
Cons:. Junk! Don't bother.. 
Summary:. For the price $300 I paid. Expect more! From west coast to east coast of Canada the piece of junk managed to get me to take roads that dead-ended at border crossings 3 times. It was set on the fastest route: How is that possible when one has to stay over in the U.S. Plus the fact I didn't have my passport on me. Cost me hours of driving and $$$ in fuel. No setting to remain in Canada. Never had a problem before with ordinary road maps. Anybody wanna buy a used one cheap, LOL.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are none since the unit never worked properly.. 
Cons:. I recently purchased this unit and within the first 2 days of use started malfunctioning. The screen would freeze plus the voice would all of a sudden become unintelligible. I was SO disappointed and immediately returned the unit.. 
Summary:. I would look elsewhere as the problems I experienced are common with these units. Look on previous reviews and you will see the same issues over and over again.. 

$$;
Pros:. There are no pros for this unit!. 
Cons:. The unti locks up at random, is slow on the maps, and the bluetooth feature is unstable at best. The power cord is also huge and bulky.. 
Summary:. Avoid this product! I even exchanged the first one for another . . . same problems!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large, wide, bright touchscreen. 
Cons:. Very slow, poor routing, traffic reports useless, expensive map updates. 
Summary:. I've driven around the US and Europe with this GPS, and it almost always fails to create a reasonable route. It has directed me over pedestrian-only streets, the wrong way down one-way roads, through the congested centers of old European cities, onto single-lane almost-dirt roads. It has directed me to leave the highway to drive on surface streets, and to get onto highways when surface streets are faster. It's failed to navigate the highways and city streets of the largest cities in the US as well as the smaller roads of rural towns and suburbs. I have no idea where its directions are good, but the one thing I always do before setting out on a trip is to review it to make sure it isn't doing something insane.. The traffic reporting/prediction feature is also completely worthless. My Nuvi has NEVER accurately reported a traffic condition. It reports "green" when I stuck in traffic (in the middle of Los Angeles!) and "red" when traffic is moving at the speed limit. It reports traffic alerts that never materialize. Its traffic delay time estimates are worthless.. If you truly want a laugh, turn on "traffic avoidance" and watch the terrible routing work together with the incorrect traffic reports to having you driving all over the map: sudden instructions to exit the highway, make U-turns, return to the highway. It's pathetic.. And if this weren't enough, the device is also horribly slow. It often lags behind your turns so badly that it decides you aren't following its directions. And then when it realizes you are, it tries to restore the directions. Sometimes it gets confused and requires a hard-reboot, but mostly it just takes minutes to restore the route. Searching for destinations is also woefully slow. It can take MINUTES to return a search for, say, "Marriot" and sometimes fails to return results even when later searches DO find them.. Finally, the user interface is a nightmare to navigate. It forces you to specify a State to search in, but in some cases still lists destinations thousands of miles away first in the search results, forcing you to scroll through them. If you navigate the menus to change a setting, the interface forces you to hit the "Back" button until you get back to the map, which can be quite distracting!. Overall, for a company that has been producing these devices for so many years, it is an embarrassment. CNet's positive review of this product casts serious doubt on its objectivity as a review site.. My advice is to buy a smart phone with a GPS enabled and use Google Maps to navigate instead.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good toy, if you're biking.. 
Cons:. I just sent back my Nuvi 265WT after being lost in Chicago for 2hours, the directions come very late and wrong, and the speakers are very poor quality, don?t waste your money.. 
Summary:. I purchase the nuvi265WT for my daughter, (I have the Nuvi 255W what is much better). 

$$;
Pros:. I like the big screen, it is good. The handsfree works pretty good even with my SonyEricsson W580i which is NOT on the list. The unit is thin and light, mount is good.. 
Cons:. The maps are terrible. Roads are labeled wrong and missing, major roads that have been here over fifty years. It will only find East addresses on my street; I live on the West end. It won't find my shop or my parent?s home. I have up-to-date maps.. 
Summary:. I thought it was a great buy at $200 and I trusted the Garmin name, but I was wrong. It looks good and the handsfree is nice. But the GPS and maps are very poor. The unit seems slow and Garmin support is non-existent. DON'T BUY THIS UNIT or ANY Garmin with these maps.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to read. 
Cons:. INACCURATE! ROADS THAT HAVE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS ARE NOT IN THE UNIT; CONSTANT "RECALCULATING" EVEN WHEN GETTING ON TO FWY RAMPS. TRAFFIC CONTROL IS A JOKE- ITS TOO LATE WHEN YOU ARE NOTIFIED. ANNOYING UNIT - LOOKING TO RTN IT. DONT WASTE YOUR $. 
Summary:. THIS UNIT IS INACCURATE AND ANNOYING TO USE. SUCTION CUP STOPPED WKG AFTER A FEW MONTHS AND THE UNIT DOES NOT HAVE ROADS THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS INPUTED WHICH GARMIN JUST BLAMES ON THEIR PROVIDER. DONT WASTE YOU MONEY.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing! It's completely useless!. 
Cons:. Maps are out of date, tech support is useless. After the insult you by insinuations that you didn't purchase the unit they hang up on you!. 
Summary:. Got the unit, followed instructions to register it with Garmin and that's the ONLY thing that worked well. It then checked for updates to the software and maps and reported that both are current. I tried to use it and was directed to enter the freeway at a closed on ramp (we've got a widening project going on, six of the downtown on ramps have been closed for two years - and will stay closed for another 18 months). I called Tech support and TRIED to explain the problem, the first techie said the maps are current and hung up on me. The second one said they are out of date, gave me the new version number and told me how to update the maps. I tried, but their website says they are current. Then I found a link where I can pay $119 for updated maps four times a year as long as I own the unit and purchased that option. I got the confirmation email with a link to update the maps - I clicked - I got a page not found error. All in all I'd say the only thing accomplished here is that Garmin has ripped me off for about $475 at this point.. Updated. on Feb 4, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. When the GPS unit worked, it worked I would rate as average. The screen is nice and menus when working are easy to use.. 
Cons:. Traffic updates are slow and inaccurate. Directions at times, do not indicate the shortest or fastest route. Unstable software and hardware. Undependable if you really need to depend on a GPS.. 
Summary:. There are too many things wrong to pick one to start with. I bought mine on a Black Friday deal and have had to exchange it 4 times since then. All the units I have exchanged at some point while driving freeze up and reboot requiring the user to re-agree and enter the information again. This occurred with and without the unit being plugged into the powersource. I corresponded with Garmin and they even said the unit was defective. But come on, 4 units of the same model in less then a month!!! That tells me it is a flawwed design. When it did work, the directions were off and not usually the best route. The text to speach at times became garbled or silent for periods of time. The traffic updates are slow and inaccurate until it is too late and you are then neck deep in traffic. The funny thing is my wife agreed to get this GPS if I would stop cursing while driving. Instead, I curse even more just at the GPS instead of the traffic. Be careful when purchasing this unit, unless that is of course you enjoy being constantly fustrated with a product that is as dependable and valuable as a McDonald's Happy Meal toy.. 

$$;
Pros:. It looks like a GPS devise.. 
Cons:. I am very disappointed for this GPS unit. slow, lots of errors in the map. it often gives ridiculous guidance. I am really surprised to see such poor quality product from Garmin..
