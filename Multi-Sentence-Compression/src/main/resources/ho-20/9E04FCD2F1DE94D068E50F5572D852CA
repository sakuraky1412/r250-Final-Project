the highlight of my stay , other than being double billed for an extra night , was when `` max '' the night front desk manager told me that there were no rooms left , and would need to bugger off at noon .
alvarado did help , and told me that somehow the hotel found a room , and is letting me stay in the same room .
the food is subpar ; so is the service , and the weird spa that seems to cater to both sexes in a coed environment .
who knows , i could have been the person that would have scaled up , and turned from being offended to being offended to being thankful .
as an experienced traveler , i can only assume that the guests are loyal to the brand and do n't know any better .
there is no possible way that anyone could find this property appealing when there is so much competing product that is tangibly better when it comes to service and hardware .
i can not understand why anyone would stay at this hotel - for the life of me .
this is an older property that seems to have all the attributes of a top notch resort .
of course , no one informed me that i would be allowed to stay .
needless to say , i will never stay at one and only , and will share my experience with every person i meet for as long as i live .
i appreciate his efforts , but my stay was ruined because oc the horrible attitude of the night manager .
it never crossed his mind to gratuitously offer to help me find another hotel or to try to up-sell me on a large suite at the sister property .
the prices are a bit less than al qasr , but the product is radically different .
other than alvaro , angel , and aidonis , the staff here is 3rd tier .
he also offered to persuade the hotel i had booked not to charge me .
yet , it has nothing .
this could have easily been avoided with basic training and common sense .
there is nothing distinguishable .
i am curious why .
go figure in a muslim country .
