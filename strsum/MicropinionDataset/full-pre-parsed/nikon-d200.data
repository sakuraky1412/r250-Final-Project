the product is great for everyday and vacation photography  .

art photography as always is done with medium to large format film  .

the d200 with the 18    200mm lens makes everything i do more fun  .

i take it with me when hiking , playing golf or enjoying an outdoor evening concert at the park (evening    it's the only time i opt for a fast lens) .

i've had this camera for over a year and it has never let me down  .

i would say just about every picture i take is perfect and the few that ar not are my fault not the d200s .

this camera has been the golden experience compared to many many many other digital's thank you to whoever guided me properly on this  .

at $1500 now for d200 , nothing really match up with this semi pro d    slr the winning point of d200 is not just the image quality or the feature  .

it is a combination of the build quality , handling , feature and quality compare to my canon 5d , i would still say 5d has better image quality at high iso  .

but i love d200's handling and control layout much better  .

if you shotting raw (which i do) , the difference on image quality between this two is very small and i will choice d200 over 5d for a better and quick handling and feels  .

of course if take cost into account canon 5d will still cost you over $1200    $1500 more compare to $1500 street price of d200 for me a perfect camera is combination of everything  .

and i believer nikon d200 is just perfect at it's class .

this is the best camera on the market right now  .

aside from the mighty d2xs .

have had nikon d70 and canon 5d imho this is the best camera made for the money for my professional work .

i have been using nikon for many years  .

i have never had a problem with one  .

i have just upgraded to the d200 and cannot fault it  .

the camera is well built and easy to use  .

but more importantly the picture quality is beautiful with clean colours and nice tones  .

i have blown images up to 12  16 and i cannot tell the difference to neg  .

i is trained with a ba in photography so i know what to look for  .

i recommend especially with the battery grip it improves the handeling even more  .

this is the one to shop for  .

of course , the d70 became the camera of the year for 2004 and this one has already had it's vote to become the camera of the year for 2006  .

the workmanship , quality and etc are just the top of the list of what this camera has to offer  .

i have been using this camera for the past 300 shots and everyone of them has been better than the previous one  .

since this is a pro series camera it would take sometimes and many trials to get to know it  .

i have been using it with 10    20mm , 20mm , 18    200mm and 10  .

5mm with some magnificant results  .

this is certainly make your money worth .

to good to be true  .

i picked this camera up at a local photo store december 14th , body only  .

at the same time i ordered the 18    200mm f/3  .

5    5  .

6 g ed    if af    s vr dx zoom    nikkor  .

for the next few weeks i used the camera with a few older nikon lenses i had  .

everything looked great , image quality is excellent  .

on december 21st i picked up the 18    200 lens  .

what a combination , easy to carry  .

i have one small bag that holds the camera with lens my other choice is the canon 5d , but i just cannot see spending the extra money on the 5d when i know in a year or two , both of these cameras will be obsolete  .

i did borrow a 5d from a friend and rented a nikon d2x  .

the controls on the nikon just felt better  .

the d2x performed as well if not better than the 5d  .

but the image quality of the 5d at full aperture at the edges is horrible  .

and i is using good lenses too the canon 30d and 5d are tempting , but why pay for 8mp (30d) when you can have 10  .

and even thought the 5d has more mp (12mp) of what use are they if you have to chop the edges , not to mention the body is almost twice the price bottom line , it's a fantastic camera , the price is right and most nikon lenses are excellent .

this camera finally makes the semi    pro nikon cameras come alive  .

the d200 to a certain extent put the other ds (50 , 70 , 100) to shame  .

with one of the excellent nikon lens (i did not buy the one that is released with camera)  .

there are so many pro features that it takes some time to read the manual and learn the camera  .

that is right folks , read the manual .

all i can say is wow  .

this is my 1st nikon slr and i am sold on it after just 3 days  .

it took me about 1 hour to master it  .

very easy to use and really solid feel  .

i will repost after using it for some time .

i have been testing with this camera for a few weeks now , and i have been loving it  .

it is super responsive and takes beautiful pictures  .

i really like the layout of the controls over other cameras i have tested  .

the large screen is key and very bright  .

i know that there is no perfect camera , but due to what you get for this price , i had to give this camera a 10  .

if you are looking at cameras in this price range do yourself a favor and get this one  .

the canon d20 is a good camera too , but falls short of the d200 .

this is the dslr that i have been waiting for  .

if you are a nikon slr user , either an advanced amatuer or professional then you have to look at this camera  .

the viewfinder gives a feeling very similar to the f100 , f80 and other similar nikons  .

it feels like a quality camera and performs like one  .

i have had mine a week and am estatic  .

this is the dslr camera that i waited for that would prove , at a reasonable price to be a worthy succesor to my f80 and f90 .

first of all , i've had the d200 for two weeks now and it is amazing  .

i currently own the d2x , the 5d , the 20d , the d50 and have also owned the 1ds  .

this is without doubt the most pleasurable to use over all and if i could only keep one (which i'm well on my way to doing) it would be the d200 and the f6 (i know i only said one but the worlds best analogue slr is in a league reserved only for it's self)  .

now on to aimee baldrige  .

one user wrote aimee baldrige's review sucks  .

my opinion is that not only does it suck , all of her reviews suck  .

however i do not blame her as she is only the messenger and you know what they say about not shooting the aforementioned  .

i blame the wigs at c|net  .

cannot you guys get someone worthy of our respect  .

someone who actually knows and has a passion for what she's doing as opposed to someone who looks like she's read a bunch of other ill written reviews and decided to repeat what we all already know  .

it is not her fault , get someone who will tell us somthing about the product from a perspective that is beneficial to us , get someone who is passionate will you please  .

as we're on the subject , how is it that users feel inclined to write assinine comments like this is the camera we've all been waiting for without actaully having the product in their hands or indeed owning it  .

if people are going to review products without having any first hand experience , then what does that say about the integrity of this site  .

to offset the very unhelpful readers who are reviewing this camera as a '5 or 6 or 7' before they've even touched it if you must comment on this camera , at least read the comprehensive dpreview  .

com preview , or some other detailed hands    on review first .

this is my fourth nikon dslr , having the d40 and d80 ( just sold my d1x ) , and am tickled pink with it ( especially since i waited to get it from b st b y for $600 )  .

all the features i need ( dedicated buttons for wb , iso , bkt , focus area switch , and such ) , and in a magnesium body  .

same battery as my d80 ( too bad the mb    d80 won't fit that'd save me another 100 bucks or so )  .

and too bad i cannot use my wireless ml    3l remote , either  .

i haven't seen any artifacts in my images , and they're sharp enough through my 18    200mm vr  .

if you're getting fuzzy images , i'd check your technique , rather than blame the camera  .

gobs of customized settings , and no stupid scene modes the d40 is awfully small , even in my little hands ; the d1x is a monster  .

both the d80 and d200 are just the right size  .

the d200 does not have the d80's ( or the d40's ) tendency to overexpose  .

i wish it took sd cards , but the 4gb microdrive i'm using seems to be working just fine ( it came with my d1x , but is unusable in it , so it is no extra cost to me )  .

all are capable of capturing excellent images ; the deciding factor is the ten inches behind the viewfinder .

i have the upper advantage of rating cameras because i get to not only play with almost everyone of them , but i sell them  .

just one advantage is that i get to see what other people say and purchase , and even better i get to see what comes back broken  .

another advantage is that i get to see the pictures people take with there cameras from beginners to professionals  .

i am able to talk to the camera manufactures rep and get all my answers and concerns answered by them as well  .

all to make my decision on what cameras i would like to sell and purchase for myself as far as the nikon d200 you need to see the cons  .

the pros are so vast there isnt enough room to list them all unfortunately the d200 has one or two cons to an otherwise perfect camera  .

firstly the noise is bad if youre shooting at iso of 1600 and 3200  .

the trick i found i tried to stay in a lower iso and used a lot more lighting to compensate for this problem  .

other cameras in this category appear to do a better job at this  .

though to be fair this camera wasnt designed to have a high sensitivity to light but there is a standard set by the competition  .

the white balance performance is an issue to me  .

i felt like i had to constantly adjust the wb settings  .

the auto white balance is defiantly lacking  .

i found a product later called and expo disc that i use now to set the preset wb and this seems to work well for me  .

some photographers complained about the software that is supplies with the camera but i never felt that it is a big deal  .

i use adobe photoshop cs and have later purchased nikons program capture i understand that software isnt always included with the package  .

after all neither were the lenses , case , and memory cards  .

there is no perfect camera in the world , but this is defiantly close .

i have had this camera for about one year now and have shot about 12  .

000 photos , including macros , portraits , nature and sports  .

i will not add another extended review , i have already seen some good of those , just a few remarks first of all the camera seems to have a very solid body , which got away from a fall from about 1  .

5m height without even a scratch  .

it has a solid grip and feels just like mounting into your hand the image quality it delivers is very good , the only thing that i did not like is that the photos are a bit soft  .

although the cam has sharpening settings even with a +3 the image is not exactly sharp  .

not that this is a problem , once printed the images look just great one of the best things about this cam , as with any of nikon's cams , is its easy handlig , which will be much appreciated by professionals and semi    alike , who need quick access to key settings such as iso , f    stop , shutter speed , autofocus settings , quality , white balance , shooting mode and more , all of which are available right on your fingertips overall i am very pleased with this camera .

beautiful machine with lots and lots of features that will make u smile after every shut  .

i have it for 3 months now and it's just gorgeous  .

i have the 70    300vr on my d200 and miracles are in every day of use .

this camera has everything you will ever want or need in a dslr  .

i also own the nikon d70 , which is junk compared to the d200  .

has 3 meter modes (3d matrix , center weight , spot) , multiple autofocus options , beautifull white balance options (and of course , auto white balance) , quick start    up and quick 3fps , iso settings at your fingertips , a front and rear/thumb wheel to control both aperture and shutter speed with ease depth of field preview is included , as well as other programable features that you can program to do whatever you want at the touch of a button  .

for example , i can leave my sb    800 flash on , and turn off the flash with the touch of a button on the front of the camera  .

cool  .

this camera can even control sb    800 flashes wirelessly when put in commander mode awesome camera  .

besides the poor battery life , i do not know what else nikon can do to improve the d200 at the moment  .

poor battery life warrants a 9  .

otherwise , would have been a 10 .

the d200 works well with all my existing ai manual lenses i had for my old nikon fe and fe2 , as well as the two ed af lenses i purchased to use with it  .

this alone gives me a level of usability of invested capital that is very comforting the camera also performs great with the sb600 and sb800 , with the commander mode and remote control of peripheral flashes try one out and join the club  .

after considering the canon 5d i upgraded to the d200 after using the d70 for about two years  .

i am completely happy with this camera  .

the colors are far superior to the d70 and the images are very sharp  .

it feels sturdy and is well balanced  .

i am happy i purcheased this camera  .

it has immeadiately made my images better .

honestly , i do not understand the issue raised by the reviewer about jpeg artifacts for the nikon d200  .

you would think a tech    savvy content provider like cnet would understand that simple down    sampling of a 10  .

2 megapixel image solves that problem (any jpeg output suffers from artifacts  .

one can easily do this and still meet most offset print needs  .

or       the more glaring omission here       that working with images in nikon's nef raw format makes the artifact point entirely moot  .

this is a camera for imaging professionals , and deserves a review reflecting experience in the field , and not simply rewriting nikon's spec sheet  .

cnet needs to step up to the plate , or farm out such reviews to those with professional experience , as evidenced on numerous other sites .

i do wedding photography professionally and have for about 8 years  .

i currently do about 3 weddings a month  .

in the past i have used the d70 my used to be favorite and then upgraded to the d80 when it came out i is not overly thrilled with the d80  .

it did the job only slightly better than my d70 or even my d50 could do i purchased the d200 about 3 months ago  .

i have since sold the d70 and decided to sell the d80 too  .

i am not knocking the d80  .

it is probably all the camera most would ever need i had to make a decision between the d200 and the canon 5d  .

the d2x is just too pricy for my tastes , so not an option yet , until the prices come down a bit more  .

or maybe even go back to a d70  .

nah well since the 5d would require me to re outfit my lenses , speed lites , etc  .

i opted for the d200 instead  .

i have a few associates who own the d200 and they all raved about it  .

one let me try it out for a day  .

when i used it i is amazed  .

it felt very secure in my hands and very solid build quality  .

this camera is fast and built like a tank  .

i live in san diego , so having a rainy day is few and far between  .

however , it is nice to know the d200 is weatherized , to a point  .

i is very pleased overall  .

if you are an experienced photographer , you will be too  .

gone are all the scene modes that amatures tend to all too often rely on  .

personally , i always found them an annoyance and in the way  .

so , minus them on the d200 is a plus in my opinion  .

i think the few who have degraded the d200 are probably rather inexperienced photographers to start with the buttons are placed in a familiar location , other nikon users will have no problem adjusting to  .

the foot print is larger than either the d70 or d80 , although , not by much  .

it does place some of the buttons a little further away than your thumbs might be used to  .

i have fairly large hands , so for me , this is not an issue , although , i did notice it at first the real advantage of this camera is its features and price  .

for the money , you cant beat it  .

the d200 has adopted many of the features of its bigger brother the d2x  .

so much so , that is shares a closer relationship with the d2x than any other dslr in the nikon product line  .

the d200 does this at about one third the price of the d2x too it will allow you to get the shots you have often missed  .

i pair this camera with my nikkor 18    200mm vr lens and the sb800 speed lite  .

the combination gives me the flexibility i need for the type of photography i do  .

a plan is in the works to upgrade to a set of f2  .

8 lenses in the near future  .

it would be nice to have a second d200 body , so i wouldnt have to switch lenses  .

it's only money , right  .

if you have read this far , i will now say a few words about the cons of this camera  .

probably my biggest gripe about this camera is , i have noticed my shots tend to be a bit softer than with my d70 or d80  .

the best way i can explain it is they just dont seem to pop the way they did from my d70  .

even the d80 is alittle disapointing in this area  .

realizing the two cameras share the same sensor , i wonder if this maybe be an inherent issues with this sensor  .

at any rate , i have to sharpen all of my photos taken with the d200 in photoshop  .

i would have blamed this on my 18    200 lens first , but i have used this lens on my d70 with no softness problems i have not tried to boost the sharpen quality in the camera , as i want to reserve that for post if needed and shots with this camera all need it  .

if anyone has noticed a similar problem and has received satisfactory results by boosting the sharpen in camera , id like to know about it the color saturation at the default setting is rather dull  .

turn up the saturation to either the + enhanced or more vivid and this problem goes away  .

the contrast tends to be a little weak in the shadows , but a tweek to the exposure comp button will generally fix that  .

just be aware of it before shooting something important and adjust for it ahead of time the auto white balance setting is not as good as my d80 was  .

it is perfect outside , but inside under tungsten lighting or mixed lighting , it is far too warm  .

i use the expo disc and manually set white balance or use the kelvin settings to acheive a better result than auto for this camera higher iso will definitely show some noise  .

it is probably not as good as my d70 was , but then again it is a higher resolution sensor too the menu system  .

i set it and forget it  .

gone are the in camera editing modes of the d80  .

i did not ever use them anyway , so again , just an amature annoyance to me  .

however , the menue system on the d200 , although rich with options and features , it is a bit convulted to say the least  .

once set up though , i find i really never have to go to it for anything , unless i want to check my battery life (more on that below) or turn on/off auto iso  .

nikon did do a great job of including a huge array of advanced feature adjustments in the menus , finding them and remembering where they all are is the only gripe  .

fortunately all of the really critical features are on dedicated buttons  .

so , set up your menue in a way which works for you and then forget it the battery life is no where near the rated amount stated by nikon and no where near as good as either my d70 or d80 were  .

i used to be able to do an entire wedding day with two batteries with the d70 or d80  .

with this camera i need at least three final thoughts  .

the d200 camera is more than enough camera for just about any shooting situation  .

it has been a long awaited update to the very popular d100  .

nikon has improved over the d100 in so many ways i am glad i purchased it  .

it will see many years of use and should hold up well due to it's ruggend build quality .

i've had this camera for about a month now  .

and i cannot say enough how great this camera is  .

it has more things in it and on it then most will ever need or use my skill level is above amature but not pro  .

and i'm still reading the book this is not a first camera buy if you buy this camera know what your doing if not it will eat you alive my grip is with the on line company i brought mine from bestpricecameras  .

com in nyc which is were i live 1)after long conversation with sales rep and explaining to him that i did not want the japanese camera but american camera  .

and he asured me that , that's all they sell  .

they sent me a japanese one 2)sent it back ups next day for 40  .

00 still have not gotten credit for it after it is promised 3)phone customer service is so bad , long and i mean long wait times on hold , then when they pick up the rep doesn't even check to see if ur sales man or women is in they just switch you over  .

and if he or she is not then u have to do the long wait all over again 4)after recieving the japanese camera back the next day it took them 4 days to send me the us one  .

the sales reps are like speed talking and want to get off the phone as soon as possible and act as though they do not want to really answer any questions about anything 5)so in short  .

i can not recommend anyone to use this on line site they have good prices but after the sale your pretty much on your own  .

use one of the recommened sites and good stores it's not worth the stress great camera bad company bestpricecameras  .

com stay away from .

i am not going to reiterate what my compatriots have already said about the d200  .

i will summarize that again the nikon lens and slr system puts the others to shame  .

obviously , this is not a camera for a novice (or even newbie in the photo game) or anyone who is not going to use it quite a bit  .

it is a heavy , solid piece of equipment but it produces perfect photos  .

the only real complaint is that nikon , as in past models , puts too much on the camera  .

the phlanx of small buttons , knobs and switches gets confusing after a time  .

also , in cold weather like now when you have gloves on , it makes it nearly impossible to change the settings  .

however , that is a small complaint and gets lost when you take into consideration how wonderful the d200 is .

wish they would not have someone that shoots a point and shoot digital do the review for a dslr  .

this camera is done a large injustice being reviewed by amy baldridge  .

mention the fact that it takes all the old ai ais lenses and meters with them , the 4 programmable memory banks in shooting menu , csm menu and in the preset wb  .

the absolutely amazing af that this camera is capable of in next to no light what    so    ever  .

true to life color reproduction without going to the oversaturated look that some of us have come to expect from other companies (sony cough cough canon) .

at first the d200 looked very intimidating , and it is for someone use to using a point and shoot it is not easy to figure out , there are so many buttons  .

i upgraded from a d70 to this camera , i've been so use to using menus and submenus to get my desired settings  .

the basics are similar but once you learn what these buttons do , you can change to the desired settings of your camera in the dark just by pushing or listing to the clicks  .

it's a little bit heavy but for me it adds to the stability of my shots , i like the rubbery texture of the grip , it makes it hard to slip out of your hand  .

i have owned 6 digital cameras kodak , olympus , 2 sony's , a d70 and now this one best camera i've ever used and owned  .

i do not foresee any reason to upgrade any time soon .

this is a fantastic camera for people who know photography and are willing to take the time to really learn all the controls and features  .

it is not an automatic point and shoot and some people need to realize this  .

yes , some unfortunate people may have been sent a lemon camera , but this is a complex electronic device and things like that happen  .

that's why nikon and other electronics companies offer warranties to fix these problems free of charge  .

this camera should have a rating of 9+ if not for people giving low scores because they are unhappy about the cnet review , do not know how to use the camera , or received a defective unit  .

i have shot thousands of pictures with mine and the image quality is great  .

in addition , i think the design and layout of the controls on the nikon dslrs are so much more intuitive than canons  .

a flick of the index finger can turn on any model as opposed to a switch located near the lcd screen like canons have  .

anyways , try before you buy and if you make a commitment to learn the camera , you will definitely not regret it  .

my only cons that i can come up with at this point are minor ones .

this is my first really nice digital and got the 18    200 lens  .

meets all of my needs although eventually got sb    800 flash which is great  .

pictures of my family come out great  .

vacation    great  .

very fast and accurate get it  .

i have owned my d200 for a couple of weeks now , and am ecstatic with its performance  .

as a photographer who is constantly seeking to better my skills and produce more creative images , purchasing the d200 has been a move in the right direction    it won't magically improve my images , but certainly provides me with the tools to acheive my goals  .

coming from the d70s , the rgb histograms are a most welcome feature as are the additional focusing points  .

i love that i have access to most controls from the outside of the camera and don't have to hunt through the menus to find them  .

nikon's design on this camera is phenominal and i'm sure that as time goes on , i'll only find more things to appreciate  .

the battery life on the d200 does leave room for improvement , but seeing as i always shoot with the mb    d200 (which holds 2 en    el3e batteries) this has not really been an issue for me  .

the d200 definitely offers fantastic value for money .

i did a lot of research before buying this camera , and is impressed by the overwhelmingly positve feedback  .

i have had the camera for three weeks , and it is everything that is promised , and maybe more  .

i love the feel of the camera , and the controls make perfect sense  .

a thorough review of the manual is recommended to understand the capabilities of the camera , but then figuring out how to achieve the desired settings is pure common sense  .

the photos need almost no post production work , provided you know what you're doing when you take the photo in the first place  .

the large 2  .

5 lcd provides the confidence to know that you captured what you wanted to , and the zoom function is very easy to use the battery life is not the 1800 pictures that nikon boasts , but depending on your photo shoot , it is better than the 200 or so that many of the reviews have quoted  .

i have kept track of the shots taken on my current battery charge , over a few days  .

so far i have taken 465 pictures under a variety of conditions , and the battery life still shows 31% remaining i am very impressed by the quality of the photos at 800 iso  .

there is some noise , but it is minimal for such a high setting  .

the continuous shooting works pretty much as promised  .

i have an 80x cf card , and under good daylight conditions i is able to take 34 shots before the buffer filled up (in 7 seconds) , and five seconds later , i could take 10 more (even though the buffer is still writing to the card) if nikon could find a way to incorporate the holographic focusing that sony uses on its high end prosumer cameras , which allows perfect focus under absolute zero lighting conditions , it would be perfect , but as is , it is pretty close .

a superb natural colour tone characteristics for a digital camera  .

a good substitute for those who wants quality without burning a hole in the pocket .

i replaced my d70 with the d200 and overall it is a very nice camera  .

however i have noticed that the photos taken with the d70 seemed sharper  .

i have not noticed the banding that others talk about yet  .

the d200 also feels more solid compared to the d70  .

overall i think the d200 will be a big hit as a second body for pro's and with advanced amateurs .

i have had the d200 camera body for a week  .

i had to wait 2 weeks for it to arrive and it is worth it  .

i had just sold my nikon f3hp and waist level viewfinder and also my coolpix 950  .

in december i had purchased an olympus sp    500 , which i still plan to use for travel , but i is looking for a digital camera that would let me use the 7 nikon lenses i had , 24mm f/2  .

8 , 35mm f/2  .

8 , 50mm f/1  .

4 , 55mm micronikkor f/2  .

8 with pk13 , 300mm f/4  .

5 , 80    200 mm zoom f/4 and 35mm to 105 mm f/3  .

5    4  .

5 with macro feature , some dating back to the mid 70's  .

i had looked at a d70 , but it just didn't feel right and it really didn't let you use manual lenses    you could attach them but got no metering  .

after doing a lot of research and finding out i couldn't get very much for my manual lenses , i discovered that they would work with the d200 [if they are at least ai    more on that later]  .

so when the body came i quickly charged up the battery , skimmed through the book , and started mounting lenses  .

first you notice right away that although the d200 is about the same size as the d70 , it feels a lot better , because it is metal and a bit heavier  .

the eye level viewfinder is beautiful , nice and bright and you can turn on a grid array , just like i had in my f3  .

it shows 95% of the image , a drawback from the f3 , but better than most dslr's  .

everything is where it should be  .

your fingers fall naturally on the shutter button [which has no preceivable lag]  .

the control panel display on the top is huge , as is the lcd screen for looking at menus and pictures  .

using manual lenses has its plusses and minuses  .

you cannot use programmed mode or shutter priority with the manual lens  .

you can only use aperture priority and manual , and of course you have to manually focus  .

but you get full color matrix metering as long as you enter your lenses focal length and max aperture in the camera data base  .

if you don't enter this data , you still can use spot or center weighting , but even those will be more accurate if you enter the data  .

also as long as your lens has a 5  .

6 of less f number , you get assisted focusing as you manually focus    a symbol comes on in the viewfinder when you are dead on  .

it gets a little dicy if you want color matrix and are shooting a zoom  .

as you change focal length or if as in the case of my 34 to 105 zoom the aperture changes , you need to change those values in the camera to get the best results  .

nikon makes this easier by allowing you to program the function button so that you can press it and thumb the main command dial and or sub command dial and scroll through different focal lengths and apertures  .

this only takes seconds  .

also all this data that you enter shows up in the viewfinder  .

i am still playing with all the customizable functions , so i have much more to test , but every lens but one took flawless pictures , dead on in exposure  .

the exception is my 35mm  .

i in an addle brained rush put the 35 mm on the camera , forgetting it is not ai  .

this is a no no  .

i didn't notice that it is not really fully on , but is jammed  .

i tried to take a picture and the viewfinder is reporting an aperture lower than the f/2  .

when i saw what i had done , i is really sweating , as i is afraid i had damaged the camera  .

i did get it off though , and quickly isolated it from the other lenses  .

now you also have to realize that with the reduced functions [no auto focus , no p or s] you also get some big benefits  .

first you won't have to buy any lenses for awhile , except maybe in the wide angle area  .

because of the difference in size between the sensor and 35mm film , you get a 1  .

5 x factor for all of your lens focal lengths  .

so my 24mm is now a 36mm on the camera and my 300 mm f/4 is now a 450mm  .

remember this is without a loss of f stop  .

just try and price a digital 300 mm f/4  .

secondly we all know that the old lenses were mechanical marvels , they had very small abberations compared to todays digital lenses , unless you plan to pay $3 or 4 thousand for one  .

they are just faster and better made  .

so people will tell you that you no longer need fast lenses today because the cameras can deliver higher iso numbers  .

this is true , but it is nice to have an f/1  .

4 75 mm equivilent or even an 450mm f/4 in a tele when you need it  .

also though you have to focus manually and set the aperture manually like you did in old film days , you also do not have to wait for the lens to focus  .

you can press the shutter at any time , getting faster pictures  .

with an autofocus lens , it has to be in focus before the camera will fire  .

so if you shoot like an old film pro and set you lenses to hyperfocal distances , you have a mean candid camera with instant pictures  .

as i try out more things , i will come back and add to this , but since i had not seen any review that addressed manual lenses , i wanted to put this up  .

one other thing  .

i could not use my old nikon f model ii bellows with the camera because it hit the rails  .

i had tried it with the pk 13 ring to give me some clearance , but it was not enough  .

in summary  .

a great camera , with dead on metering and superb color and lightening speed .

to start with i just purchased my d200 two weeks ago and i have taken around 1800 images and i am frankly amazed prior to this i used a number of film slrs and recently a non slr digital camera lets start with the   this slr is big       not crasy big but large enough for everyone time i am shooting someone walks up to me and asks if i am working for a magazine  .

it fits my hands well and is not to heavy   the battery life is not what i expected , although after a few rechargings of the battery , its life span has increased about 30% to around 800 pictures per charge  .

do not expect to get this if you have long exposures       a ten minute exposure dropped my meter down a notch , and another d200 user ran his battery down completely from full on one 80 minute exposure  .

you can buy and external two battery pack , which fits on to the battery compartment and doubles its battery lifespan or allows the user to put in double a batteries       i will buy this soon pros  .

the camera is nicely designed , i can get to the iso , whitebalance , and quality quickly       and the iso emulation works better than i expected       i saw no grain at 400 (well a hint only when i is looking for it)  .

the focus works well       even when shooting at 5 frames / second  .

as expected manual is best in night shots   on high quality mode in large format i got 186 pictures (1 gig compaq flash)       far less if i select the raw option   i have not had any banding issues (early recall)  .

i am delighted that my old nikon lens work on it       even my manual lens  .

the built in flash does a great job       keep your eye on the white balance  .

it could convert someone from 35mm film to digital in a heartbeat .

i've had this camera for over 1 month now and have to say it's amazing  .

almost every shot that i take comes out perfect  .

i owned a d70 since 2004 and upgraded to the d200  .

with the d70 i always had to adjust the levels or tweak in photoshop  .

with the d200 i don't have to do anything  .

it's totally wysiwyg  .

i use nikon capture to upload the pictures and print via photoshop  .

i'm using an epson 2400 and with the provided profiles , my workflow has been drastically minimized to shoot and print the viewfinder is larger and clearer than the d70 so taking shots are easier  .

the display is large and crisp  .

the speed at taking shots is wonderful , the fastest that i have experienced so i do not miss many shots  .

the controls are easy to access and you can control most anything from the command and other dial the menus are somewhat convoluted but i'm used to that from nikon  .

once you learn them no problem i use it with the wonderful 18    200 vr and 18    400vr  .

my next lens would probably be the 12    24 and that would be all i need to carry over all i'm one happy camper .

the day i first unpacked this camera and shot my first picture with it , i knew i had made the right decision  .

compared to the d70 (also a very good camera) it is in another world  .

by published specs , it is not a d2x , but it is very close in many areas  .

like with most other technology the d2x is already starting to show it's age , after only a year and i am just not quite ready to shell out 5k for something that will probably be re    done in the next year or so  .

so , in the mean time , for 2k , i get most of the features and capabilities and get to explore more of my photography with something that exceeds my capabilities most impressive is the control layout  .

it took only a few minutes of review to find what each button , knob , switch , etc  .

, does and my fingers were able to get to them easilly without a great deal of thought  .

need to switch from single shot to continuous , a quick flick of my finger get's me 5 fps to catch what is going on  .

a simple press of the button and a turn of a knob gives me iso from 100    1600 all without having to move the camera from my eye  .

excellent job on layout image quality is superb  .

just remember , 10 megapixles will not correct for poor photographic techniques  .

take a bad picture with this camera and you will get a bad picture with more pixels than most others  .

as with most digital cameras , even those costing many thousands of dollars more , high iso settings (1000 and above) will result in a bit more noise  .

a d2x does a slightly better job with this , but the d200 is a fair step ahead of the d70 , etc the list can go on and on and on and quite honestly , most of it is beyond my knowledge  .

what i do know is that the camera fit me , has the capabilities that will alow me to progress and do excellent phtography and if my skills improve and finances allow , whatever nikon comes up with to replace the d2x (d3x  .

) would be my next step maybe i said in the cons section that this camera is more camera than most will need , but would get anyway  .

the reason i think this is a cons is that people will purchase it and then become disatisfied when they cannot control it like a d50/d70  .

it doesn't take much more thought , but an accidental slip on one of the controls will result in the camera doing something you might not be ready for  .

a setting in the software that is incorrectly done will result in poor photo's  .

if you do not take the time to learn it's capabilities , to learn the functions available , you will not be able to correct a simple problem and reset things  .

this is not a point and shoot camera  .

it is one step (1/2 maybe) below the best available and either you are serious about it and spend a few minutes to learn it , or you will end up hating it  .

it is a two edged sword    high end capabilities with a mid range pricetag  .

more people will purchase it than probably should on the other hand , if you want the ability to do many of what the big boys do with their d2x , canon's similar , etc  .

, without the pricetage , this is the camera for you .

frist of all , i normally do not rely on c|net for my camera reviews but someone made me aware of this review  .

what a piece of cr    p  .

virtually free of any content that is relevant to a potential buyer  .

secondly , giving this camera a lower rating than a canon 20d  .

how is that possible  .

on to the camera   this is what a lot of nikon users have been waiting (much too long) for   a digital nikon f100  .

it has the build quality , weather    sealing and heft that one would expect from a pro/semi    pro instrument  .

the af speed and accuracy is very impressive  .

the ability to custom the interface , buttons and menus is unsurpassed in this class  .

it is nothing short of a home run what drags the rating down is the fact that packing 10  .

2 mps into a aps    sized sensor will naturally produce a bit of noise at higher iso and i think the battery consumption is too high , but then again , knowing those weaknesses it is not hard to work around them nikon has produced a magnificent camera this time around  .

the cnet reviewer seems to have missed the point of this camera  .

someone that goes and spends so much money on a prosumer camera is not going to use jpeg nor tiff  .

owners of this camera will use raw  .

so to complain about the lack of tiff and the quality of jpeg is kind of strange .

this camera is well laid out and easy to use  .

the grips make it easy to hold  .

the diplay is big and bright  .

it is a bit heavy but it is close in weight to other cameras of this type and quality  .

the user interface is very good and simple to use  .

it even remembers the last ten or so functions so you do not have to hunt throught the menus  .

i have had mine for 6 weeks and am impressed each time i use it  .

i swear the pictures look like they were taken with a film camera  .

none of the digital problems i've encountered before  .

no noise except at high iso , a common problem with many digital cameras  .

clear clean sharp photos  .

one drawback , better have good clean glass , because you will see the differance definatly if you use cheap or dirty lenses  .

thank you nikon .

had the d200 two weeks now , sold the d2x expecting this to be a fair substitute , unconvinced , the photos are soft and the buttons on the back of the d2x were a major plus , love the size of the menu , major improvement on the d70 i used to own  .

not getting close to the battery life of the d70 or the d2x , works much better with external flash indoors , overall am sure i will get to love it when the d2x fade from my memory  .

more camera than 99  .

9% of people will ever be able to use  .

huge amount of control  .

the camera and the 18    200mm lens are a perfect match  .

cannot wait for the wifi conrols to become available .

review of aimee baldridge is very poor , with no useful information at all i have d200 for a week now , with 18    200 vr lens  .

the result from my shot trip is excellent  .

i have used f90 for more than 10 years and still not bought dslr because d1 is too expensive , while d70 is not good enough  .

this d200 perfectly meets my expectation  .

10mp is the optimum resolution for dslr  .

more than this , it may not so useful and to expensive  .

body quality should be comparable to f100 the new af    s dx vr zoom    nikkor 18    200mm f/3  .

5    5  .

6g if    ed lens can take shots 4 stops slower , which is the best in class now  .

so , i can shoot tele at very low light , very useful .

i have just spent seven days in toronto and in niagara    on    the    lake shooting with the nikon d200  .

overall , i am very impressed  .

this camera has improved on a number of areas including the resolution and camera startup  .

finally , nikon has done what canon has done with the 20d    they allow the user to pair the nef with either jpeg basic , normal , or fine  .

while some reviewers have favorably commented on the location of the three kings (wb , iso , quality) , i is not so impressed  .

i wished that nikon had placed they on the back under the screen       same position as on the nikon d2h  .

this is a very good camera       it is competitively priced ; it is fast ; it is accurate  .

i am glad that i bought it ; i have the pictures to prove it .

i did not want to buy a sub    $1000 dslr  .

i cannot afford the camera i really want at $5000  .

but now i think nikon has nailed it on the head with this blend  .

i predict this camera will hit 9 out of 10 on the cnet scale .

who in the world is aimee baldridge's  .

she truly do not know much about this camera to give a review as she did  .

i would have jus said nothing before i gave that type of review but that'sust me  .

stantheman .

i am sick of morons who rate a product that is not available to them  .

trace this guy comments and he says the same thing about every product he doesn't own and cannot afford  .

he would not have a clue as how to use it let alone afford it  .

it will be released in december  .

i can buy a good film based slr for under $300  .

it seems to me that a digital version should not cost more than $500  .

$1700 is a rip    off  .

if everyone would refuse to pay these rip    off prices the cost would fall in a hurry .

i am amazed that no mention is made of this widely known banding problem .

i recently upgraded to the d200 from the d70 which i had owned for years and took thousands of photos , both in studio and in the field  .

i expected the d200 to be at least as good if not better  .

so far , after about 300 test shots , the d70 takes a better picture , costs so much less and i sure do miss that camera  .

i plan to sell the d200 at a loss and re    purchase a d70 or d70s  .

i've been shooting photos for over 30 years now and have had photos published and often get paid for my work  .

i just cannot get the quality i expected from the d200 but loved what i is getting from my d70 , maybe my d200 is defective and i may check into that but i do not thinks its defect but rather a flaw in the design  .

my humble opinion .

i can only say that i spend $2k for 2 weeks of fun  .

it is good while the camera works but now it is just a dead weight  .

you know there are only two servicing center in the entire usa  .

i hope those of you about to purchase this product consider buy an extended warranty  .

because at the rate of problem that i am going through i do not thing it will outlast the manufacture warranty  .

better luck for than me .
