i have stayed in hotels where the beds and jammed right to the walls so this was a happy surprise for me .
the rooms are also big for manhattan , with enough room for 2 doubles , a baby crib and still space for the children to run around a little .
in short , if your chief aim is to be well location and if you plan to spend very little time in the hotel , then this is a solid choice .
my husband was here for a conference so my 2 toddlers and myself tagged along to see the christmas happenings in the city .
there simply were n't enough to go around during peak hours and with a double stroller i would usually have to watch 5-6 elevators pass me before i actually got onto one .
also seasonal i think was a selfie machine at the lobby where people could get their pictures taken and sent to their email accounts .
this is actually the first time i have encountered a hotel where the trash chute is in open view of the guests along the corridor instead of being concealed .
for tourists , the location really can not be beat , with rockefeller , times square and central park all within walking distance ( that is after negotiating your way through the seasonal crowds ) .
the lobby is stripped off any waiting area was when our friends came by to say hi there was nowhere to sit down besides at the bar .
our room , while quite big and modern had this huge water stain on one of the walls that may indicate leaking within the walls .
