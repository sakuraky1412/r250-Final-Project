friendly staff great location !

great hotel, great staff, great location not any problems what so ever .

wonderful hotel ,  excellent staff

the staff's professional, spirited attitude, , be they reservationist, valet, front desk, or housekeeper, , deserves 5 stars .

one of the friendliest desk concierge staffs i've encountered   .

the staff helped make our stay a great experience .

downsides are disinterested staff, bordering on rude and quite small rooms .

staff was neither especially helpful or unhelpful .

disappointed in front desk staff and room size

, pleasant staff, close to the wharf, just a few blocks to the cable car turnaround, pier 39 shopping,   ferry boat tours .

every hotel should have this staff !

a staff member must have gone in right after we checked out .

it was great ,  very pretty, clean, nice staff, great wine hour every evening .

a perfect hotel a perfect location perfect staff !

location, friendly staff, beautiful rooms and comfy beds .

great rooms  great staff  great hotel

staff accommodating and friendly .

there was never a time where i saw the concierge desk unstaffed .

comfortable bed, staff was excellent .

front desk staff were always pleasant .
