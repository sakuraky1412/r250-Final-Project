$$;
Pros:. The fact it was the only one with a true flat front panel still amazes me. my computer is black and silver and this moniter just put that theme to its best. the autosinc funtion is great for novices. i bought mine as a open box for 400 at circut city,. 
Cons:. dont know no problems yet. 

$$;
Pros:. Monitor was pretty fair in pricing compared to Samsung 172N and Sony SDM-X73 monitors I was looking at in Best Buy. It was gorgeous at the store to look at and the colors just seem to jump out compared to the other LCDs that were next to it. I like the ha. 
Cons:. No DVI. I wonder if that would make any difference in image quality with technology for analog these days. I guess if you had a video card with only DVI out, it would be a disadvantage. It's pretty bright and hard to tone down. The brightness may be relat. 

$$;
Pros:. I spent about a month researching 17 inch lcd's on the internet and going to various electronics stores and looking at different brands.I was scared stiff of the "GLARE" factor with this monitor, so I went to CC,BBy, Cusa several times and compared it wit. 
Cons:. None so far. 

$$;
Pros:. I spent months reading reviews on many LCD monitors, reading specs on the manufacturers' websites, and actually looking at them in various stores. When I first saw this NEC LCD1765, it jumped out and caught my attention! Not only is it a beautiful looking. 
Cons:. NONE!. 

$$;
Pros:. absolutely amazing color. amazing response times. after looking at reviews and specs online, i decide to go to the store to see it in person. (was mostly worried about the glare that everybody keeps talking about) the moniter was sitting in the middle. 
Cons:. base is a little too stiff. when i was setting it up the first time, i was a little scared i would break the base.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent picture quality, the best of any others on the market. The nice protective acrylic panel makes me feel better about the screen's lifespan. The price (Best Buy screwed up the price, got for $130 less than it should have been) was unbeatable, but. 
Cons:. I don't really have any complaints. I don't have a DVI video card, so I couldn't use it if there was an input. The stand is great, it holds monitor firmly in place after initial setup.. 

$$;
Pros:. this LCD monitor has some of the best colors that i have ever seen. I would often hate sitting in front of a CRT monitor and being able to notice that it was much clearer than my crappy sony 15" LCD, this NEC blows a lot of CRT monitors away. 
Cons:. stand inflexible. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Image Quality...very sharp text and graphics...the 16ms response time is perfect for gaming...I see NO Ghosting even when playing a game such as Unreal Tournament 2003!! that is no small feat for an LCD!. 
Cons:. None in my opinion. Yes, DVI would be nice, but with this image quality I doubt I'll ever miss it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great image/color quality and virtually no ghosting. Attractive pricing. Is very sexy to look at... =) I'm using this monitor for video editing, CG work, and fast paced FPS gaming in my spare time. I was originally planning on going with a Viewsonic V. 
Cons:. No DVI input. Don't know if this would make a difference or not though (picture is already great). Adjustment is stiff but then of course firm and sturdy. Has not been a problem for me personally although others have commented on it. Only an issue if yo. 

$$;
Pros:. The review says it pretty well. Picture is excellent and can find no bad pixels. Bright, clear, compact. So new when I bought it the store had to look up the price.. 
Cons:. The base adjustment is very stiff. There is actually more adjustment that it appears if you use a little force.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent image, brightness and contrast. 
Cons:. difficult to adjust stand heigh and position. 
Summary:. one of the best 17inch monitors. I have had it for over 2 years and have loved it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear picture nice and stream lined.. 
Cons:. Buttons on the side of screen.. 
Summary:. This LCD screen has been wonderful to me. Have had no problems in two years. Have not lost any of the color or brightness. Perfect for movies and games.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tremendously vivid brightness, design stands out from others. 
Cons:. Inflexible neck/adjuster, blacks and dark tones turn panel into a mirror. 
Summary:. I've had this panel for over a year, and I have not had one problem with it. None.. The moment that I powered it on and viewed my desktop for the first time, I was stunned at the brightness and clarity. Colors and bright tones are displayed vividly on this panel. One downside are dark tones and blacks in general, as you end up viewing yourself staring into the monitor. This isn't too big a deal for me, but might be for some.. One of the things that makes this LCD stand out is its general design and form factor. It just looks damn cool, as many others have posted here.. As nearly everybody else has pointed out here, 2 other slight downsides to this panel. The inflexible stand and crummy OSD button interface. I was terrified when I first had to adjust the stand to my liking, as it is incredibly rigid and difficult to figure out at first. Once you screw around with it for a while, however, it's not too big a deal. I generally don't move my monitor, so this isn't a problem for me.. The OSD buttons on the right of the panel are also fairly un-user friendly, but again, I do not use them all that frequently in the first place.. To me, the most important aspects when purchasing a panel were response times when playing games, brightness of colors, and overall looks. This panel possesses all of these qualities, and should absolutely be purchased by anybody looking for a 17" display.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, excellent gaming performance, outstnading color vibrance. 
Cons:. The menu button configuration is a bit tricky. 
Summary:. I received this monitor as a gift for Christmas two years ago. Today, I'm still using the monitor as my primary desktop display, and I don't have any complaints. The monitor is great for gaming performance, and the color vibrance is simply outstanding.. My only beef is with the layout of the menu buttons, all on the right side and no indicators as to what each one does unless I get up and look on the side of the display. This is, of course, hardly worth mentioning, as rarely as anyone uses those display controls, but it's none the less an annoyance.. If you're looking for a great, inexpensive LCD monitor that's suitable for gaming, you can't go wrong here.. 

$$;
Pros:. The one piece of the system, that always delivers. 
Cons:. Stand, has to be man handled, to adjust it.. 
Summary:. After 18 months, picture quality still leaps off the screen. This is my first LCD monitor. I choose NEC because of my experience with them in my line of work. Bullet proof pretty much describes the service this monitor will give you, no matter how hard you drive it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Clarity, Fast response in all Games. 
Cons:. The Stand is absolutely horrible. 
Summary:. Bought this just over a year ago. Still no dead pixels. Have played everything from Doom 3, HalfLife 2, and World of Warcraft and NO GHOSTING. Not even a little that I could tell. The glass covering the monitor is/was a great idea in keeping the monitor clean and from getting broken.. The stand really does suck. Not much options with it but to buy a stand to put it on. But overall, buying a stand was worth it. If you can find it, get it. Even in a day of 8ms LCD's, this one will hold its own.. 

$$;
Pros:. This monitor is just awesome. I have had it for a month and its the only thing i talk about. No dead pixels. I love the glossy protective screen over the lcd. They have the best picture i have seen on any monitor. THe display just puts out this 'sexy'. 
Cons:. Sure it comes with a vga connector but thats why they make converters (really not that big of a deal). For some reason that base is really hard to get opened up but after a few times it gets easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. This monitor offers the very best of both worlds. It has the LCD display and clear and crisp images of a CRT. It really does look like a piece of art work if you hang it on the wall. It doesn't look like all the other LCD monitor out on the market toda. 
Cons:. Hard to adjust stand and reposition montor, however it is very sturdy and has a solid feel to it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful finish and design. Simple setup Incredible vivid colors and high resolution. Extremely study frame.. 
Cons:. Only 1 year warranty.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very impressive image.. 
Cons:. stand leaves a lot to be desired.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything is of the highest quality, no exaggeration. The picture is crystal clear, one could not ask anything more from a monitor, whether it was LCD or CRT. All text is MUCH crisper than the text on my 19" Viewsonic CRT. The same holds true with games.. 
Cons:. Short warrenty, glare an issue when background is black, but otherwise not a problem. No DVI, but DVI probably isnt necessary.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, very easy to read, even at 1280x1024 res. Easy on the eyes. Instant on (ok, that's a given since it's Solid State). Hard to tip over with the tight base. No dead or 'stuck on' pixels/transistors. Very high quality all around.. 
Cons:. Although my video card is Analog only, so is the NEC LCD 1765. I feel the monitor should also incorporate a Digital connection as well as Analog.. 

$$;
Pros:. Just insanely awesome pciture quality, best bang for the buck, awesome protective screen, sturdy base, NOT FLIMSY at all. VERY High Quality-Had the LCD for almost 3-4 months now, and i still get crazy responses from my buddies when they se it for the firs. 
Cons:. Glare can sometimes get annoying,but not bad at all, makes movies look crazy clear and beautful. Nothing Esle. 

$$;
Pros:. I used to be a die-hard CRT fan, but this monitor has made a convert out of me. When I saw the 1765 at BestBuy, I knew my old CRT was doomed. I truly mistook it for a CRT before looking at it from the side. Now that I've had mine for more than a month,. 
Cons:. The plastic protective screen could cause glare issues, but I've already tried mine in a few different lighting conditions and haven't had any trouble at all. The base is fairly stiff, it usually requires putting the monitor on it's face to adjust it (be. 

$$;
Pros:. Great LCD screen. Clear Picture, great for games and DVD's. The Auto Synch feature took care of a blur issue I had at first. Now everything is crystal clear.. 
Cons:. Stiff Stand, in-fact it was so stiff, I didn't realize it would bend the way I wanted it to, until I saw a diagram of it in the instructions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent LCD. Excellent color reproduction. 16ms refresh mean no ghosting for games (Counter Strike, Homeworld2, etc.) The plexiglass surface protect the delicate LCD screen and provide a stylish look. This screen replaced my 19" CRT.. 
Cons:. DVI would be nice. Weak 1 year warranty. Finger prints on the glossy screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. The NEC LCD1765 is the best 17 inch LCD in its class. It hands down destroys the competition, including Apple's more expensive studio display. The image quality is phenomenal, and the monitor feels very solid. It's a steal at $500.. 
Cons:. There is only an analog interface, and there can be some glare on the screen when bright lights are nearby.. 

$$;
Pros:. I have gone through many many LCD's and I have finally found the holy grail of LCD monitors. The PQ on this product is simply PHENOMENAL, especially if you have it sitting next to other LCD monitors. Sharp, crisp, and easy on the eyes. Suitable for bot. 
Cons:. A lil expensive compared to other 17 inch LCD's. No DVI. :( Also, the base is not as tight as others have mentioned, but it is a little tough to move into the position you want to at first. And yes, the screen has an acrylic surface so you face a little. 

$$;
Pros:. -16ms Response time means no no ghosting, even when playing any kind of game. -Image quality is amazing, image is very sharp -Clear plastic window protects the LCD screen, and makes the monitor much easier to clean without risking damage to the screen.. 
Cons:. -The monitor stand is surprisingly very stiff -The bottom portion of the screen seems to be a little brighter than the upper portion. At first I thought the particular monitor I had didnt have well-balanced back-lighting. But I looked at another unit of. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. The picture is awsome 2. Looks great 3. Really fast, no usual LCD problems for gamers like myself.. 
Cons:. Stiff stand Some glare in bright area. No DVI (Probly no difference) (Is it HDTV Compatable?). 

$$;
Pros:. the image on this monitor is ridicoulesly better than any other moniter in it's class. if i had to i'd buy it all over again with no regrets.it's a shame they dont make a 19in.. 
Cons:. alot of ppl complain that the stand is stiff but, isn't it supposed to be steardy? i have no complaints.. 

$$;
Pros:. I was so delighted by this monitor's image quality that I bought 5 more (I trade professionally). You can buy this monitor and be sure the image will be superb and it will work reliable for quite a while. I have 6, they run all day every day, and in one. 
Cons:. no dvi; monitor base does not swivel. 

$$;
Pros:. Image quality unsurpassed, matches the CRT's one. Glass protection not only improves image quality but also make it easy to clean the display (common problem for LCDs). 
Cons:. Just 1-year warranty, most of its competitors offer 3. Almost un-adjustable, impossible to set it perfectly vertical.. 

$$;
Pros:. I've bought this LCD screen 10 months ago and I'm very pleased. The colors are vivid and the text is sharp. I haven't seen another LCD featuring a better text/image quality (well, the LCDs at Futureshop that is). Almost forgot to mention that the refre. 
Cons:. Glares on the protective screen.. 

$$;
Pros:. Vibrant Display...You will think it was a CRT! Fast...No Ghosting...Great gaming! Style, Style, Style!!! Not a single Dead or stuck pixel. Love it more each and every day!. 
Cons:. No digital input. Oh well...With picture quality like this, who cares...Glare, I am used to it. The pros of having the glass protective shield over the screen wayyyy out way the pit falls of not having it. (I'd hate to think that the delicate LCD surfa. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture at any price.. 
Cons:. base is hard to move. no usb ports. glare...but easily fixed by placing light source behind monitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sleek design. Great picture. NO regrets.. 
Cons:. A little hard to adjusts the hieght. Fear of breaking it. Over that fear now.. 

$$;
Pros:. I've had this monitor for 3 months now and the high quality images still amaze me. The contrast ratio and brightness may not be as much as some other monitors, but seeing is believing. I was afraid of purchasing this monitor because of the glare, but it. 
Cons:. Price could be a little lower. Would be nice to have the A/C box built into the monitor to reduce bulk.. 

$$;
Pros:. Crisp, bright, clear, sharp. Sturdy, solid. Hi-tech look.. 
Cons:. Haven't found any yet. But it could use a handle.. 

$$;
Pros:. This LCD definitely stands out in the crowd. As a matter of fact thats how i chose it. After seeing about 12 LCD's all in a row at Best Buy my eye kept stopping on this monitor. After living with it for a week i love it even more. Stiff bracket? Not. 
Cons:. Protective glass is a virtual magnet for dust. Could use a "night mode" to soften the brightness for late night surfing (then again it may even have one and i just haven't gotten to it yet).. 

$$;
Pros:. This monitor stands out in form and delivers in function. There is only one other monitor that has caught my eye as much as the NEC LCD1765 - the Apple Wide screen cinema display (which is about $3000 I think). Downloaded pictures look AMAZING on the NE. 
Cons:. Not using it for portability -so no comment there. There is a glare, but when viewing photos it gives the appearance of a glossy print, or artwork under glass. Even though the brightness seems to be rated lower than others, I have never noticed any lack. 

$$;
Pros:. Monitor looks great. Solid colors, better than most on textual display.. 
Cons:. My backlight was not working well - bottom of screen was washed out - had to return it. Hard to adjust frame - stiff. Too low - had no height adj.. 

$$;
Pros:. My monitor died a while ago, and being a primary FPS gamer, I wasn't sure if I should even bother looking at LCD's yet, or wait for next gen technology to push the refresh limits beyond 16ms. Anyways, to make a long story short, I seen the text clarity. 
Cons:. I had 2 main problems with this Monitor and I can't believe NEC did this, but it does **** me off because I know they are going to come out with a newer version to address these issues, and now I wont be able to get the improved version. 1. No DVI Cable. 

$$;
Pros:. The picture is very bright and extremely sharp. When I was picking one out in the store there wasn't another one as bright or sharp ( I couldn't even make one as bright or sharp with the adjustments.) The picture is phenomenal. No ghosting. Stand is stiff. 
Cons:. No DVI, but I don't think the picture could be better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Actually, I bough 15inch model, LCD1565. I really like it. No dead pixel. - Protective screen: best cover for my kid. - Clean, bright screen: Cnet marked brightness is 228 nits. Lowest among the comparison. But, whatever it is, This monitor is bright enou. 
Cons:. - Same as many people said adjustment is very difficult - No DVI connection: not bad for me, yet. - Little bit of glare. But, if you put your room light behind the monitor, there is no glare or less. It works for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks as good as CRT! No ghosting! Not a single bad pixel! Best side to side view on an LCD screen available! Much better color and vibrance than any Sony, Viewsonic, etc. in the same price range IMYHOP! Totaly satisfied owner! A must buy!. 
Cons:. No DVI inputs. Doubt much improvement....Looks so darn good! Stiff adjustment. Scared me at first...But after a few attempts...No problemo and I am not worried about it...Can we say "SOLID" construction? A bit of glare...I'm used to that....But then it. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright vivid colors, very attractive design the black rim with silver accents are very nice. The overall picture quality of this monitor is amazing. Everytime somebody views the performance for the first time they are completely blown away. The protective. 
Cons:. Two cons: no DVI input and the glare. But trust me, after you see it in person the glare won't bother you in the least bit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pros, hmmm, the fact that I walked up to it believing that it was a regular CRT montior because of the true colour I saw gleaming from it! It truly amazed me! I viewed a long line of LCD panels from a sharp side angle and only a few were nearly as viewabl. 
Cons:. I would have to say the only thing bad about the protective screen is the glare, but I am so used to it from all other types of CRT displays that I just look past it, ha. The non DVI input really surprised me, I actually bought a graphics card with DVI be. 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic picture/colors/shading/textur e and brightness. Good customers service when I needed a part replaced after a quick error on my part.. 
Cons:. Stiff stand, but still usable. Only 1 year warranty, but tech service was great. Pity they don't make them in bigger sizes. There is some glare on the screen which can't be avoided.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unprecedented picture quality (for a LCD). Color, sharpness, even brightness will blow you away. Very little ghosting on fast moving video/games.. 
Cons:. Stiff stand and not much height adjustment. No carry handle. No DVI. Pretty amazing that these are the only "cons"...I could live with this monitor forever. Now if they only made a 21 incher with the same quality....mmmmmmm. 

$$;
Pros:. The CNET review doesn't like the buttons, but of the 5, you only use 3 to navigate the menu. The sleek face is amazing and puts to shame all other monitors. Wonderful for watching DVD's as well, but you may want to turn down the lights.. 
Cons:. Not a true 24-bit display, although I really can't tell the difference.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sharp, bright, colorful display. Looks much better than my Sony CRT. No ghosting with FPS games.. 
Cons:. Base has limited adjustability. I have only had this monitor for a couple of days, but no significant cons yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture and speed.. 
Cons:. I spent a lot of time researching 17" LCD's and I eneded up buying the LCD1760NX over the 1765 for a few reasons. First, according to NEC they use the same panel but the 1760NX is brighter and has a higher contrast ratio. The 16ms response time is the sam. 

$$;
Pros:. The visual output from the monitor is quite good. Text is sharp (although some fonts look better than others), and graphics look great. Ghosting is minimal, and 3d games look very nice on it. The monitor is big, bright and easy to read. The price is reaso. 
Cons:. The stand IS hard to adjust. Just say to yourself, "I will not break it. I will not break it." And push it into place forcefully. There is glare on this monitor. But because the monitor is so bright, flat, and clear, the glare really isn't too bad. A CRT. 

$$;
Pros:. The plastic screen makes colors more saturated... and makes it bling bling shiny just sitting there.. 
Cons:. I use this as a second display for my ibook.... occasionally, i move the iSight camera from the lid of the ibook to the top of the NEC.... and if ever i bump the table, the iSight flops off and knicks the acrylic screen.... very noticeable marks now if th. 

$$;
Pros:. The color is absolutely brilliant, and image quality is the best I've seen on a monitor.. 
Cons:. The glare on this monitor is 10X worse than on a CRT. Using this monitor for extended periods of times will leave you with incredible eye strain. I think I'm going to exchange mine. The monitor itself is great, but the acrylic cover is death to the eye. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing looking display, great finish. Sharp!. 
Cons:. No DVI, kind of stiff base, but you get used to it. Biggest drawback though - SHORT manufacturer warrenty (1yr). Bought from Circuit City, got extended dead pixel coverage/warrenty for almost 100. Geez. But all in all a good buy.. 

$$;
Pros:. This monitor is so clear to work with that I can sit at it all day without fatigue.. 
Cons:. Too heavy to carry around with my laptop .. but then it does have a glass faceplate.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great looking display. Best I have ever seen on an LCD. I run it at 1024x768 because 1280x1024 is just to small for me(even with large fonts). Still looks great at 1024x768. This was great upgrade from my NEC3FGe. I think the stiff stand is a good thi. 
Cons:. As soon as I turned on the LCD for the first time I immediately saw a stuck green pixel. This could have been a very big problem for me because LCD manufactures won't take back a screen with one stuck pixel. After the screen was on about 30 minutes I wa. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing picture clarity, the colors are so vivid and the 16ms response is a plus for gamers like myself.. 
Cons:. The glare is sooo annoying! Or maybe its just my room setup. The designers should have thought of using a glare filter for the plastic they placed in front of the LCD.. 

$$;
Pros:. The monitor has all the features for a home user at a reasonable price.. 
Cons:. Mine broke within several days of receiving it. The manufacturer shipped me a refurbished model that worked, but had a bad pixel right in the middle of the screen. Then the next surprise came. When I went to return the broken monitor, I found out that I. 

$$;
Pros:. I love this monitor. I have two side by side. The picture quality if great,a nd offsets the glare you read about. They are like peices of modern art, and look great on the desk.. 
Cons:. BUT! I have bought 4 monitors total, and am returning two as two in a row i got were lemons ( acording to NEC ) as they would start to flicker and image shift randomly. Frustrating,a nd ahassle for project movement! I have had no trouble with NEC on the p. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent image quality and accurate colors (for an LCD). Was an awesome monitor when working. 
Cons:. Not certain if this is usual, but mine died after less than 3 months of use. Just stopped powering up. NEC will honor the warranty, but the customer service is unhelpful and quite rude. I find interesting that mine died so quickly and this monitor's wa.
