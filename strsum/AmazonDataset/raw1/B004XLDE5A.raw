Common failure part in these dryers, but with the great price on these replacements I still have margin to make money and repair the right time the first time!

Excellent! Exactly what I needed.
This did the trick to make my dryer new again. It is a bit different than the original. You have to splice 2 wires together, so be prepared with wire cutters and something to crimp it. The replacement needs screws to secure to the element and in my bag there wasn't any, so I had to make a quick trip to the hardware store to buy them. (all of `10 cents,but added an extra hour to my repair time). All in all my clothes are actually drying at the right time now and I don't have to run it a second time. It came new in plastic bag.
