we stayed at the hyatt for four nights over independence day following a very long trip down the west coast of america and what an impression this gave us of the hotel management .
there were large parties who took their own food and drinks to the pool and partied .
it was just like they were in their own back yard to use an american saying .
what amazed us more than ever , that they seemed to think it was acceptable to take an assortment of bbq style food in trays and cool boxes full of drinks to a public area of the hotel .
we tried to obtain seating or sun loungers around the pool on the 4th july only to discover the very large parties taking place .
whether they were guests of the hotel we were unsure .
we were amazed that these parties had the audacity to celebrate around the pool when other guests were having to purchase food and drink from the hotel .
where were the management during this time ?
when we left the pool area at the top of the escalator there appeared to be a very large burly figure who perhaps was one of the management but he appeared to be doing little to control the situation .
in contrast the rest of our stay at the hyatt was wonderful and we thoroughly enjoyed all aspects of the hotel , apart from the above .
thank you to all the staff . . .

thank you to all the staff at the hyatt for making our vacation special but where were the hotel management in allowing guests to party with their own food and drink when they should have perhaps been in their own backyard , not a five star hotel.
