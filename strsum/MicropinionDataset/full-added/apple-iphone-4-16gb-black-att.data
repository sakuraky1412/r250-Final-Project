most powerful phone i've ever own  .
the fact that i can edit hd video from anywhere and then upload it is amazing  .
not to mention the beautiful screen and millions of apps available  .
it literally will do anything you could possibilly ask of a phone and computer  .
love it  .
i love this phone  .
i previously had a sony ericsson w580i that had pretty much fallen apart  .
i considered the captivate , but its interface is really ugly in my opinion and android is not a unified experience like the iphone is meant to be  .
the iphone's interface works seamlessly  .
so seamlessly , in fact , that i can count the number of times it has lagged at all on one hand , and i've had it for over a month  .
the battery life can go for two days easily  .
i have never had a dropped call with it , and i cannot reproduce the antenna flaw on my own phone  .
facetime is flawless , as expected , and pretty neat as well bottom line    if you want a phone that works like an ipod with easy music syncing , great battery , quick internet , a flawless interface , and great applications , this is the phone for you  .
it is worth every penny .
i've had this phone for about a week after reading some of the reviews on here i is skeptical but at t gives you a full month to 'test    drive' it so i figured what the heck , if i didn't like it i'd just return it  .
well after just a little less than a week you would have to pry this thing from my cold dead fingers for me to give it up  .
it is that good  .
for anybody thinking of upgrading from a 3g do not even hesitate , just do it , you will not regret it for a second  .
for a first time smart    phone buyer , you might as well get the best if you're going to do it  .
i understand people's complaints about at t's network i had many myself and was not planning on upgrading , i is going to wait it out for the verizon iphone until i dropped my 3g into the fish tank  .
the 4 has dropped one call in a week my 3g would've easily dropped 10 (probably more)  .
so to me the reception and/or network has been greatly improved on the 4  .
i've also heard that at t is dumping more cash into their network than any other provider so i can only imagine it will get even better  .
bottom line on the 4 it is an amazing device , fast and powerful and chock full of goodies  .
and despite many of the reviews saying otherwise , it is a solid phone that does all you could ask of it .
i join the apple family last november with the 3gs and i is totally amazed with that phone but the ip4 is an outstanding smartphone  .
it covers my needs  .
the retina display is awesome way beyond anything i have ever seen before  .
there are so many good features on the phone it is hard to list  .
i got my phone on launch day and i have not had any problems  .
but the first thing i did is put my phone in a case because that is how i handle all my phones  .
so when i heard about the antennae problem i took the case off and touched the strips and yes some bars dropped but it never affected service  .
i get better reception with this phone than the 3gs  .
this is one outstanding phone and for those in good att coverage you will love this phone .
buy it  .
apple has definitely created a winner in the iphone 4  .
it is honestly the best smartphone i have used to date  .
i owned the iphone 3gs , nokia e71 , blackberry curve , lg shineplus , and blackberry pearl  .
the phone's display is incredibly bright and bold  .
the a4 processor is very powerful and does a very good job with multi    tasking  .
i use the iphone 4 with virgin mobility (owned by bell mobility) in canada  .
safari browser and mail are quick to respond and load emails or web pages  .
facetime works great with other iphones and with the new ipod touch  .
i have no clue what the whole fascade about the antenna was  .
i agree the signal drops when the magic x spot is held on the iphone but i have not had dropped calls (and i believe that's what matters) i did order the free iphone case from apple because i is being offered a free case  .
all in all , iphone 4 is the way to go  .
i'm back home apple  .
i'm in love with my new phone so that i cannot keep my hand of it more than 10 min  .
from now on i'll be using iphones .
just like it a lot .
i left verizon for this phone and i could not be more happy  .
people like to talk down at t but honestly i dropped calls with verizon everyday , at t has been good in the month i've been using them i've found that verizon is out to nickel and dime you to death , not so with the apple and at t  .
there are tens of thousands of free good quality apps found in apple's app store , i searched high and low for a free verizon app and i never found one also if i do buy an app i can sync my phone with itunes on my computer and then sync my wife's phone and put the same app on her phone for free (it's nice to save some $$$)  .
with the phone having built in wi    fi i can save on the data plan and still go on the web at work and home  .
while i'm on the go i get about 1000 emails a month with the cheaper data plan i'm very happy with my iphone and if you are thinking about getting the phone talk to someone you know who already has one  .
unfortunately many people who write these reviews have their own (stupid) agenda , and are anti    apple (only god knows why) .
the antennae issue is so minor  .
steve jobs is correct , the issue is overblown  .
buy a case and the problem is gone  .
you'll want one anyway to protect this jewel  .
my highest recommendation for the iphone 4  .
i got this phone after spending 2 weeks running around with at t ugh  .
however , once i had the phone , holy cow  .
this thing is amazing  .
it is my 1st ever smart phone and it does everything  .
it is blazing fast thanks to the a4 processor  .
a lot of people are complaining about the antenna issue , i did experience it 1 time when i first got the phone before i put the case on it  .
i havent had the issue happen since  .
the phone feels very sturdy in your hand , which is good i love the thing to pieces  .

iphone 4 has great features that have been added  .
facetime is probably the most recognized  .
3rd party companies will soon create apps for video calling such as skype and google  .
the dropped calls problem can be solved with a nice durable case to also prevent it from breaking .
great phone , best in class screen and user experience  .
fantastic phone    best i've ever owned  .
i is one of the fortunate people that pre    ordered and received it on release day w/ no waiting in lines or website hassles  .
my reception is fabulous , cannot hold it the wrong way , no problems with the antennae  .
there are no yellow lines or dots on my screen anywhere , despite what you may have read online  .
photos/video are crystal clear (flash is sunshine bright and will work during video) , voice dial is unbelievably accurate  .
google calendar sync has changed my life and my career  .
noise reduction must be working as accurate as voice dial is during traffic w/ windows down break neck speed when accessing a website    a full website no less    not just the mobile version  .
keypad is even easy to use for those with larger fingers when i let a co    worker have at it today  .
emails are amazingly simple to set up , access send  .
apps for anything that apple may have forgotten  .
if you can get one , i recommend it , i do not think you'll be sorry .
the use experience still cannot be beat and the amount of amazing apps available is awesome  .
really the screen stands out among all the other competitors  .
watch avatar on the phone and is immersed in it  .
still small , but amazing .
i had verizon since 2004 and switched to at t and have not experienced all the problems with dropped calls that many people are reporting  .
at t is spending more money than any of the other carriers upgrading their network and in the areas where i have used the phone i have experienced no problems  .
i live south of atlanta and have traveled to nc , va and sc and have found the reception in these areas to be as good as , or better than verizon  .
at t's customer service is head and shoulders above verizon ; no long waits for help  .
when i told my wife that i is going to buy iphones she told me that she only wanted a basic phone and didn't want one  .
i bought her one anyway and she uses it more than i do mine  .
bought cases for both phones , and do not see what the big deal is about having to use one  .
who is going to buy a phone like this and not use a case  .
the antenna design gives great reception and is superior to my bb 8330 my wife  .
s lg or the palm treo 700p that i have used for a charge card system  .
in the past when i have been in areas where my bb is dropping calls i used the treo  .
with its stub antenna it has always been superior to other phones for reception  .
also with at t i get my voice mail the same day i receive it ; unlike verizon which sometimes takes 3 or 4 days and delivery of email is also much faster with at t  .
people waiting on verizon  .
s version of the iphone , may find that it is not worth the wait  .
i is initially going to buy verizon  .
s version of the samsung galaxy until i read that they had reduced the memory to 2gb , removed google search and replaced it with bing which is a good app , removed google maps requiring users to purchase verizon navigator  .
if you want an iphone buy one keep your verizon service and if your at t service is not up to speed you have 30 days to cancel at t and return the phone  .
we have used the phones for 30 days and have not experienced any of the problems that some users have reported .
this is a solid phone  .
daily usage of the applications and other basic functions are excellent , making it very easy to teach technophobic relatives how to use the phone  .
the screen is stunning and sharp  .
the design of the phone makes it the best looking phone on the market today  .
i live in an area where at t coverage is one bar , and so long as i do not connect the two antennas together the quality is excellent and i have yet to drop a call , even with one bar  .
unfortunately the phone does suffer from an antenna problem , when in excellent coverage (a solid five bars) the connection will not cut out , but will in fact drop to two bars and hold steady  .
also the camera lacks the resolution and photo editing options that i would expect from a smart phone of this caliber  .
i selected this phone over the droid x and evo because i found them to be too large and unwieldy to use  .
i respect hte android operating system and think that in this market that when you are considering the droid x , iphone , evo or incredible that you cannot go wrong , it is just a matter of preference  .
if you are looking for a phone that is very chic , powerful , very easy to use , a great screen and a great ui with an average camera , and dont mind a phone case i would highly recommend this phone  .
as a side note , i do not usually like phone cases , but the fact that this phone is so good looking , and albeit a very solid feeling phone , i look forward to getting my free case in the mail to protect the glass back updated  .
on aug 2 , 2010  .
this phone capitalizes on an already great phone design seen in the 3gs  .
still sucks battery though but thats just because of how much it can do  .
recommend to anyone .
overall terrific phone  .
it is faster than my wifes 3gs when held side by side in loading apps and web browsing  .
it feels nice in the hand  .
the so called death grip is for real except not as bad as the media made it out to be  .
i have not had any dropped calls  .
it is also lightening fast when connected to router .
i switched from verizon after getting tired of verizon failing to wake up and make a deal to get this phone  .
i am a mac user and this phone interfaces so well with my two mac machines  .
beautifully designed and extremely fast  .
i have had no reception or antenna issues  .
i cannot complain about my service when with verizon but so far my reception has been fine and i have experienced no dropped calls with at t  .
additionally , i had a great experience in the at t store where i is actually given customer service , unlike my experience in verizon stores  .
i purchased invisible shield to cover it and it works flawlessly .
its a great phone period .
apple has made another top notch device and this phone desrves mounds of praise , yet the continued partnership remains a deal breaker  .
updated  .
on oct 23 , 2010  .
the iphone 4 is the best smartphone available , but like my summary states , android is catching up quickly (an in some respects has leapfrogged iphone) the retina display is great  .
text is sharp and the colors are terrific , with good saturation  .
the display looks a bit dimmer than my old iphone 3g , but still acceptable the speed of the phone is the biggest difference  .
with the combination of the a4 and 512mb ram , the iphone 4 is light years faster than my iphone 3g  .
i'm sure the android phones run just as fast , but the graphics of the iphone seem much smoother , where    as the android 'snaps' between screens and apps great battery life  .
i'm averaging between 6    8 hours every charge , depending on what i'm doing  .
i do try and extend the charge when possible , like turning off 3g at the house or turning off wi    fi at work (since we don't have it)  .
also location services , which can eat up the battery which brings me to the one of the two cons   apple really needs to let 3rd party developers bring a widget springboard to the ios 4  .
i jailbreak my iphone 3g for the sole purpose of letting me turn on/off certain battery saving functions  .
i would think apple would let the developers do this , or apple itself could do it  .
it does not take much memory , and with 512mb onboard , it's not going to crash the iphone 4  .
if they don't get around to doing it , i'll jailbreak the new phone , but will wait until after the warranty expires before doing so the other con is the glass  .
i don't care what apple says about their 'engineered' glass  .
it still sucks  .
i did get the free case , but the front screen already has several scratches in it , and believe me , i take good care of it  .
i've decided to purchase a shield , but it will only help prevent further scratches  .
really disappointed in apple in this regard the antenna issue seems to have been resolved  .
i can no longer simulate the death grip  .
not sure if ios 4  .
1 resolved it , or if turning off wi    fi has something to do with it , but it's gone  .
i got the case strictly for that purpose , but at least the case provides a bit of drop protection in summary , pretty happy with the phone  .
i don't use it a whole lot as a phone , more as the mobile computer it excels at being  .
that said , if apple does not loosen the restrictions , i'll seriously consider an android phone next time .
best phone i have ever owned  .
first , let me say that this is an amazing piece of technology  .
switching from a blackberry curve i am amazed at how much more advanced this phone is  .
the screen is beautiful , the camera is great and the handset is super fast  .
i do lose bars when i hold the phone at the sides , however , i have never dropped a call or completely lost reception while holding it at the sides  .
i live outside chicago and i am yet to find the phone without at least partial reception  .
this is great as i switched from t    mobile and their reception is awful  .
i dropped calls every day  .
the phone does so much its impossible to explain it all  .
despite the numerous positives there are some drawbacks  .
as i mentioned , reception does drop when held by the side , but a case solves the problem  .
the battery could definitely be better  .
it lasts for about a day and a half which is decent but not great  .
of course turning off wi    fi , dimming the screen , and minimizing the frequency of pushed data helps  .
one of the main cons of the phone is the lack of customization  .
i know that apple is known for a closed experience and android is more for customization , but it would be nice to at least be able to set the text tone as just vibrating  .
instead , youre forced to choose between 5 or 6 annoying text tones or set the phone to not do anything when a message is received  .
this drives me crazy since i text a lot  .
i either have to listen to a bell sound every few minutes , or i have to look at my phone all the time to check for new messages  .
that said , this is by far the best phone i have ever owned  .
it's not for everyone , but the combination of an ipod and a phone loaded with features and performance is hard to pass up .
iphone 4 has an improved bandwidth capability  .
however , the signal needs work as you are holding the unit  .
i also noticed that there is alot of heat , coming from the side the minisim card is on  .
nonetheless , apple has improved on such a wonderful piece of technology .
i actually upgraded from a blackberry bold to an iphone 4 althought the phone is good i think im gonna return it , the main reason is because i bought the phone to tether and im shocked to find out that in this day and age i cant sync my macbook pro to my iphone with bluetooth my other reason for taking it back is that i feel like a phone that is as fun as the iphone should have more should have more security features , like someone asking to play games on your phone and then reading all your text messages is not cool on my blackberry people can make calls without unlocking my phone and browsing trough my personal info the way girlfriends like to do  .
the iphone should have an option like that where you are able to make a call and or launch specific apps without unlocking the phone  .
i switched from t    mobile with a blackberry 9700 for this phone  .
i have heard some horror stories about at t , but i decided to take the leap because of apple's great customer service and products  .
so i waited two hours online at the 5th ave apple store on the release day  .
is it worth it  .
time will tell the design looks beautiful  .
the metal band and flat glossy glass helps create one of the sleekest phones on the market today  .
this is one aspect no android phone has been apple to achieve yet right now apple dominates the app market  .
they simply have more apps , but this could change in the next 2    4 years because of the rapid growth of the android market and the big brother actions of apple  .
the apps on the iphone blow blackberry apps out of the water ios4 on paper seems to be a big improvement from the previous os  .
i cannot really compare 3 versus 4 because i never owned an iphone before or used an iphone with ios3  .
the ios4 seems a little buggy , which is surprise for an apple product the screen is simply the best screen on the market today  .
you could argue that the evo's screen is much larger compared to the iphone's , but that  .
s quantity not quality  .
the retina displace is simply amazing  .
colors are accurate , blacks are ink black dark , and every image is crisp i am constantly listening to music and to have the best music player in a phone is simply awesome  .
cover flow , genius button , shuffle , and etc are killer  .
also , the picture viewer and video player are great  .
i am not a huge fan of the lack of supported formats for videos though furthermore , the iphone simply has that it factor  .
some android phones have a wow factor but not it status  .
this might change as the android community grows  .
for example   when i first got my iphone4 , dozens of people stopped me on the subway to gaze at my phone  .
in comparison , when my friend got the android incredible , no one stopped him  .
a few of our close friends noticed he got a new phone and mentioned how it seemed cool the one con not many people have been mentioning is the battery life  .
i probably have been spoiled by my previous blackberry and it  .
s massive battery and not having to charge it for days  .
the new iphone lasts maybe a day at most  .
this really depends on person usage  .
i do understand the iphone  .
s screen is a battery killer , but for a 4th generation phone the battery should be better i haven  .
t had any reception issues or had any drop calls , but the death grip issue does make sense  .
apple does need to address this  .
maybe free bumpers for everyone  .
while the design is beautiful , it  .
s not practical  .
glass on the back is bone head move  .
apple can talk all they want about how this glass is stronger then plastic , but the fact remains it  .
s still fragile glass  .
secondly , the built in radios have been poorly placed the last con might not be a big deal for everyone , but i find it to be a huge con  .
no flash  .
maybe flash is an old technology but the whole world is still using it and developing media for it  .
i can only hope apple will be able to influence companies to switch to html5 , but i highly doubt that updated  .
on jul 5 , 2010  .
the iphone is the perfect size smart phone not too big or too small  .
the user experience is unparalleled , however , simple to the point of frustrating for real geeks  .
no learning curve to use it , just pick it up and you are productive  .
touch screen is the best on the market and i have owned droids , and a myriad of other touchscreen phones  .
iphone just feels right , the others are not as good be prepared to be fleeced  .
att is a premium priced service  .
everything costs more money , it adds up quickly  .
a family plan with a few phones will set you back a car payment limited video output quality  .
no idea why , but iphone only supports 480i output , if you buy nasty composite cable connector  .
so major headaches outputting true hd content , like say , oh i do not know , how about the dang video you captured with your iphone in the first place  .
i have tried switching phones three times and tried again before the iphone 4  .
i switched back  .
there simply is not a better smartphone out there  .
any other choice and you are paying a price  .
for me the fleecing will continue for at least another year .
i'm a sotfware project manager and use a blackberry  .
i rely heavly on email and my syncing with outlook  .
i is was hoping the iphone would make the jump for business uses  .
so i sold my blackberry because in general i'm an apple person , my personal computer are apple and had high hopes for the iphone 4  .
however , all in all it falls short  .
it's a great toy and it has a great apps but it just not ready for business primetime .
proximity sensor issues make this phone all but unusable  .
it's more like a mini ipad .
i had to return it because i missed important calls , but only after i called at t customer service  .
the representative said that he doesn't know why such bad reception , according to his map i live in a very good reception area  .
then i went to at t store  .
they replaced the sim card  .
i still wonder how that helps  .
then i went to apple store  .
they replaced the phone  .
after that i came home , made one call to the iphone to check the reception  .
the call failed the next day i went back to at t and re    activated my old 3gs  .
still bad reception , but at least calls get through now the next day i returned iphone 4 to apple store  .
they couldn't , for some weird reason , put the refund money back on my credit card  .
i had to accept cash  .
and they lied on the work authorization application  .
instead of saying that i is returning it because of problems with reception , they put on the application issue   phone battery only lasts 20 minutes i signed it because i did not care and just wanted to get rid of this phone  .
but it is a good question why they put the wrong reason for returning on that application i am getting disappointed with apple .
there is a lot of great features add to this model  .
some features are limited lacking simple improvments and other features are dependent on app developers to update the apps in order to work proper  .
this can be fixed with a update  .
people just need to speak up  .
i think this phone is still a good phone and i think it is worth buying .
i think this is an amazing device  .
the os is leaps and bounds better than any other phone currently on the market  .
the problem and hence the poor rating is that as a phone it's simply terrible  .
i switched carriers and have owned this product for a couple months now  .
bottom line it drops an unusual amount of calls  .
i can understand the occasional droped call , but it's constant  .
where do i live you ask  .
austin tx , a major city where i do believe att is the no  .
1 carrier  .
that being said , in my opinion there is certainly a defect in the phone and perhaps even network problems with att  .
but i know many people with the 3g 3g s models , who do not have the drop call issues  .
so it must be the phone  .
yes i do have a case on it , it helped some , but still have a lot of dropped calls  .
if they fix this issue , which i am sure they are working for the next model already , i would easily give this a much better rating .
if you want to use this device for something other than making phone calls , it is one of the best products on the market  .
the camera is basically the equivalent of any stand alone digital camera  .
the internet , applications , and screen resolution for videos are also a huge plus , in a way that the iphone's rivals simply cannot compete unfortunately , it is an inferior cell phone , which drops calls , has horrific reception issues , and almost certainly retains a design flaw in its antenna , which apple (alas , toyota's floor mats) is continuing to lie to the public about and asserting that it's the result of how you hold the iphone or a glitch that omits revealing how many bars you really have  .
that is nonsense  .
it has dropped calls in dead zones (over a dozen and counting) that never existed when i talked on my motorola in the same areas and locations (with the same cell phone plan and company)  .
take this as a warning  .
i bought into the apple myth and paid the price , in more ways than one  .
the iphone 4 is steve jobs' windows vista .
i do love the 3g version    wish i had not purchased the new one  .
i purposely snitch from blackberry torch to iphone 4 to evaluate if we can use it as business phone  .
what a disappointment , what a mistake  .
having device what will give you over 30 hrs of battery life while in constant use , iphone 4 , after being fully charged for over 10 hrs , running only 2 apps (phone and mail) manage to hold charge for 4 hrs  .
called apple tech  .
support twice and after checking all settings and make sure that no apps are running multitasking , finally get phone replaced    had well known manufacturing battery defect with new phone , fully charged , battery life is as expected from such device but , the moment i enabled my exchange mail to sync , battery just drained in front of my eyes (had filling that i'm looking into stop    watch , not power meter)  .
bottom line   if you want cool looking gadget , get a iphone 4 , but if you want to use it as your business device , look somewhere else as this is not what you will be happy with .
it is truly amazing to watch this device as it sits on the desk next to me and i am on a call  .
first you cant hear the person (full bars showing) os 4  .
1 installed  .
next it drops the call with 2 bars showing  .
the icing on the cake is the fact that after it drops the call it goes to no bars then refuses to make an outgoing call to reconnect , for about 2 minutes (long enough so that the caller you were attempting to communicate with has moved on to the next item of business)  .
all day long i get voicemail without the phone ever ringing , but that is sop for at t so i do not fault the phone for that .
dislike , its overrated , not much of an upgrade from last one , i dont see much of a wow feature to it , the android market is taking customers away because of the iphones inability to provide products for the customer , plus you require to have a case for the phone  .
cant be any worse product , i am changing it , facetime is a powerful reason to make the change to the newest generation but barely being able to use feature as requires wifi all the time  .
bad  .
i have been an apple die hard for the past 3 years    waiting in line for this junk has angered me  .
they should not have released it and i should have taken heed to the fact that when steve jobs did his demonstration he could not get it to work  .
neither can i  .
i'm not going to keep it .
if you must iphone , iphone3  .
do not upgrade as you'll be disappoint  .
please check iphone4 os boards and bluetooth pairing    they've missed in two key areas .
this phone dropped every single call i made , hence it is not a cell phone , it is a toy .
my experience , is 2 days on the phone to apple , and the 3rd day driving an to a apple store , and there is no resolution , i had mail it back .
Face time (skype can make an app), clean design, high resolution, fast; dropped calls problem, expensive, fragile

design. ease of use. apps; one carrier, one price. video output, only 480i, but camera supports 720!!
Display; Speed; Apps; Battery Life; Glass scratches easily; no springboard widgets to quickly enable/disable certain functions.
Speed, Reception, Voice Dial Accuracy, Apps for That (they're not kidding), Intuitive, User Friendly,; Slippery, Can't find a good cover yet.
Retina display, fast processing time, call reception, signal strength, sleek design, strong metal casing, battery power, multi-tasking on iOS 4, HDR with camera, facetime; There are none!
Great display. FAAAAAAST!!. Awesome camera. Great call quality and speakerphone; Not a con I can think of!
Everything you like about iphones: apps, web, beauty, design.; It doesn't make calls, so it's not a phone
Excellent interface, lots of cool apps (free), nice, simple design, large display; If used as voice/data device in business environment, running Microsoft Exchange, battery life is unacceptable, holding charge for 3-4 hrs.
Processor, screen resolution, battery, camra, folders, multi-tasking; 3G network runs slow as if using the edge, mail retrieves data when fetch new data is off, folders are limited, text message ringtones still limited, contact organization still limited, muli-tasking works only if app is compatable
Design, beautiful screen, snappy processor, excellent call quality at low signal strength, overall interactions with the phone; Suffers from the antenna problem, not impressed with the camera quality.
easy to learn; I had intermittent home button problems , the antenna was not my issue
Interface. Display. Video Camera. Ability to edit with iMovie. App Store. Itunes.; So far I have had no negative issues with this phone.
Retina display!!!. ease of use. design of the phone. so many things unable to list; none great phone
Not sure. Liked my iphone 3 - numerous software and bluetooth issues with iphone 4.; NOT an upgrade - more like a Gates product - software glitches and bluetooth headsets have trouble pairing and staying connected.
Faster. Efficient &#38; Glassy! Fits in an average "5th Pocket" on a pair of Levi jeans.; Feels heavier - Antennae Issue - No Grip for the back.
Ridiculously gorgeous screen, by far the best touchscreen keyboard available, loaded feature set, great camera, very fast, satisfactory reception, cheaper data plans than other providers.; Reception does drop when held at side, battery life could be better, customization is minimal, annoying text message tones.
Sleek design. Apps Galore. iOS4. Cameras. Beautiful screen. it's a iPhone!. The best music player in the game; Battery. Design (All glass really!?). iOS4 isn't really all that it's cracked up to be. Reception?. AT&#38;T?. Flash?
Wonderful for everything not associated with making calls. Excellent internet, numerous apps, outstanding camera.; Drops calls, even with case cover, has terrible reception, and has dead zones my previous non-iphone product (with the same AT&#38;T plan) never experienced.
Some of the functions like tethering and face work well.; AT&#38;T cost is to high with competition.
Screen. Processor. Ease of Use. Features. Battery Life. Build Quality. Availability of Apps. IOS4; AT&#38;T leaves alot to be desired. Antenna issue, but it isnt an issue cuse i have a case.

The convenience of using it. Just like all the other iPhones; Bad reception. In 3 days that I had it, there were numerous dropped calls, failed calls, searching for service. But I think something was not right with carrier.
Speed, design, apps, folders, compatibility and versatility; None for the iPhone 4. Why does this CNET Review list a price of $599 for the iPhone and then list the subsidized price for the DROID-X. They both have the same subsidized price, but CNET seems to be purposely inflating the price of the Apple iPhone
Fast, glitch free operation. No Windows Mobile like sluggishness. Outstanding screen. Accelerometer really works! Apps are magic! This smartphone functions intuitively. Why did I wait so long to buy an Iphone?; Occaisional app hiccups, but this device is still light years ahead of any smart phone or mobile phone I have ever owned or tested.
Video camera; Reception issues, automatically reboots, loses my contacts at will and now I'm forced to buy new accessories bumper sucks! It doesn't protect the phone. Face time only works on wi-fi with other iPhone 4 users. This phone SUCKS!
The design the flatness, and amazing screenm the os is so simple,; AT&#38;T is horrible and if you jailbreak it for a different netwrok you can no longer sync with itunes
Screen resolution, call quality, user friendly! Basically everything!; A little too pricey. I would like to have the option of using other carrier, but I have had no issues with AT&#38;T.
Plays YouTube videos in HD. It is thin light two cameras. Has the best looking screen on a smartphone; some of my favorite apps are not iOS 4 optimized (eg. Crunchyroll). And theres no way to downgrade its firmware
has a front interface camera; it has a front interface camera lol who is really gonna be like o im going to video chat with someone only when there at home, what happens if someone who travels only has a time frame to do it, phone is way behind the curve
Great reception and voice quality. There are many apps that the average user will find useful. I travel the SE and find the AT&#38;T coverage as good as Verizons.; Unlike my BB I can not set the phone to turn itself off at night and back on in the morning which extends the battery life.
-Beautiful screen. You have to see it to truly appreciate it.. -Stunning Design. -Roughly a bajillion apps.. -Fast 3G and great coverage (in the Midwest at least).. -Fantastic Camera. -Speed. -Efficient Multitasking. -Great Battery Life; -Either it can be beautiful and fragile (my preference) or ugly and sturdy with a case. -No unlimited data. -speakers on bottom can be accidentally made very quiet with a finger covering them (usually when playing games)
The screen is amazing, the camera takes better picks then 8 mega pix cameras (more isn't always better), face time is cool, more free apps then i know what to do with, Wi-Fi. Oh and the design is great, no cheap plastic on this phone.; I would like to see face time work on 3G and not just Wi-Fi.
works amazing with with my car deck, through bluetooth sync, wicked screen resolution, really fast, camera is amazing.; bluetooth does not sync with macbook pro even though the phone instructs you to do so to tether...please apple get on this. lack of security features. screen is a finger print magnet.
It has a beautiful display. As a phone, call reception is perfect. As an Ipod, there's no doubt about music quality. But more important is it's functionality and ability to download apps from the store; may be apple should include a free leather case in the box like RIM does with its BBs.
Loved the 3g version and love the apps and ease of use. Facetime is a wonderful addition and love the smaller phone.; During a 10-minute phone call it usually drops 3-4 times. Every couple of minutes my call drops and I don't live in a huge metro area - this is awful when I'm having a client conference and have to keep dialing into a conference line.
Faster internet, much faster the the older models. combined inbox, the face time works just like they say. I only used it once but it worked really well.; unable to set a different sound for each inbox. software seems very glitchie. My bluetooth no longer works correctly (tried 3 different ones). Overall i'm not impressed and am thinking about going back to the blackberry
Ease of use.. Fast.. Screen.. Battery Life.; I do notice a drop of one bar on the signal meter when I give it the "Death Grip", but no problems as long as I have 4 or 5 bars.. It can be hard to tell which side is the front at a glance when the screen is black.
The new apps available with the model are terrific. The style of the device as well as the battery life are all good.; The phone quality is simply unacceptable for an adult. The speakerphone is too quiet to use in noisy environments, the proximity sensor hardware does not work correctly. The Phone is useless. My rating is so low because it is billed as a phone.
Compact and beautiful design. Outrageously bright and crisp screen. Camera that takes great pictures and video. Smooth interface. Feels like your smoothly surfing. Battery life is decent. Fun face time camera. All in all an awesome user experience.; Camera has a blue spot under fluorescent low lighting. I understand that this doesn't happen to every phone. May take it back and see if there is a fix. Att service isn't great but I've noticed that no ones service is perfect even in the city.
Internet browsing on this phone is a LOT faster than on previous models. I could not be happier with the speed--it blows all other mobile phones away. The apps are fabulous too. Screen is gorgeous. Touch screen is easy to use.; Two words: PROXIMITY SENSOR!! The sensor is broken. It doesn't detect your cheek and the screen activates, calling other people while you are on the line. I can't tell you how many times I've had to apologize to people because of this.
Not even how beautiful it looks, it is harder to grasp with your hands, no connectivity to itunes ( once plugged in after replacing the phone didn't allow me to restore from backup, so lost all my contacts. Apple you have disappointed me so much.; Drop calls , proximity sensor is bad (dial calls while in current call, goes on speaker, starts face time on a call) Battery ( plugged in all night until fully charged, 1 phone call of 3 minutes at 8 am and then by 11 am is on the red zone)
The phone is lightening fast! It easily beats iPhone 3 and Droid friends are envious of how fast it can open and switch between apps. The battery life also puts Droid to shame! Camera has replaced my point and shoot digital camera even on vacation!; I really can't honestly think of a con for it so far. I was unable to replicate the reception issue but put a case on it anyway to protect the beautiful phone. Make sure you go with a clear case so the back can be seen.
