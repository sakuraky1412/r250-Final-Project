we booked one nights stay via an internet site prior to catching a gatwick flight .
when we arrived we found an impressive atrium reception with lots going on but a very very very long queue to check in which moved slowly .
our booking was for bed and breakfast but the hotel had us as room only .
i explained that i had definitely booked b & b but the receptionist was immovable and suggested i call the booking agent .
as it was very late in the evening and after a long journey to gatwick i decided to accept the room only but was offered breakfast at an additional charge of 27 quid for two people .
i declined feeling a bit undervalued as a customer .
we had a nice room but it turned out that it was beside a fire door which kept banging all night as people were leaving for early morning flights so had little sleep .
the bathroom was nice with nice complimentaries and the bed was comfortable although the pillows had seen better days .
we had a meal in the urban restaurant and the waiter was funny , engaging and pleasant , the food ( mushroom stroganoff ) was really very good and more than you might expect from an airport hotel .
when we checked out we were not asked if our stay had been pleasant so did n't mention the noise , pillows and lack of breakfast .
shame really as it could have been a nicer . . .
