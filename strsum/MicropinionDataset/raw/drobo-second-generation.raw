Pros:. does everything the 1st one did, with faster data transfer speeds &#38; FireWire. 
Cons:. great buy for the price. 
Summary:. Is this review a joke?. I followed Drobo for a long time and this guy is a welcome upgrade to the one that's already out. I bought one and have had none of these problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, redundant, safe and simple, perfect for photos. 
Cons:. Ethernet needs to be integrated into Drobo unit. 
Summary:. I have to agree with the other posts here. After waiting to receive my Drobo 2nd generation for a couple of weeks, I just tried transferring my photo gallery to the new Drobo using FW800 and it was very fast, much faster than the older USB only version. I now have two Drobos because my storage needs are huge and cannot fit on just one Drobo with the capacity limitations of current hard disks. Drobo is in my opinion the best storage product for my photography needs on the market - hands down. The review slams the new Drobo for being slow, but given my experience I have no idea how he came to this conclusion, except to say that the "official response" from Data Robotics must be accurate. How unfortunate that such a cool, innovative and easy to use product gets an unfair review from a professional reviewer. I love my Drobos and if it were not for them I would not have peace of mind for my priceless images. Bravo Drobo!. 

$$;
Pros:. Safe, expandable, reliable storage. 
Cons:. None to mention. 
Summary:. This review was based on a defective pre-production review unit. We remained puzzled as to why the reviewer published this review despite having a requested a replacement production unit which we agreed to provide. Data Robotics stands by its products. If you're interested in reading reporting that is more representative of the new Drobo please see the following:. http://twipphoto.com/archives/593. http://thomashawk.com/2008/07/welcome-to-drobo-20-two-times-faster.html#links.

Pros:. Fast, Quiet, No-Brainer. 
Cons:. would like an activity light + activity alert in the Drobo Dashboard (DataRobotics... if you're listening...?). 
Summary:. I wrote this review in the Drobo 4tb section... but have moved it here.. I pre-ordered the Drobo II in Zurich a couple weeks ago, and paid about $650 for it. I was nervous... actually very nervous.... because the reviews for the 1st Gen Drobo were a bit Hit-or-Miss.... and the reviews for the 2nd Gen were spotty as well. I read and re-read the CNET review.... hoping there would be a third iteration to it that said, "despite our 1st and 2nd attempts with the Drobo... our 3rd attempt reveals that it is the most amazing, lightning-fast, whisper-quiet, energy-efficient, super-secure piece of hardware we have ever tested".. That review never came.... and I was constantly bothered that they hadn't reviewed the Drobo with a Mac / OS X.. I am a storage junkie, and so this is my Drobo experience (thus far) in so many words:. Performance..... With iMac 2.8Ghz, 4gb RAM, OS X 10.5.5 - ONLY TESTED FIREWIRE 800 - Drobo II with 4tb (4 x 1tb) Seagate Barracuda ES.2. Transfer speeds are not lightning-fast..... but they are certainly AS Fast - if not faster - than the CNET tests. I transfered 100gb of small data files and music, with an average transfer/write speed of 260Mbps. I then transfered 1tb of larger files with an average write speed of 310Mbps. I can't be certain why there is such a significant difference here... but I think it has to do with the file structures.. In Comparison.... I have a 2Tb WD drive that runs at roughly the same speed.. Frankly... to me... this is fast enough. And, the Drobo feels more stable than the WD, as it doesn't go to sleep after 5 minutes, and then completely freeze my operations for the 3 minutes it requires to wake itself up.. Sound.... I have bad ears from a childhood and adult/childhood spent on/in/around motorcycles. But, I swear.... I cannot here the Drobo from 2ft away. In comparison, I can hear my WD 2tb from up-to 10 feet away. The Drobo is Whisper Quiet.. Setup..... Took a total of about 7 minutes, once I had inserted the drives (literally, like CNET says... "just like putting a CD into a CD-ROM drive"..... there are no cartridges to assemble!!!) and installed the Drobo Dashboard. The Software tells you that it needs to "initialize" the drives, and then within a couple minutes (maybe 3-4), you have the Drobo sitting on the left of your finder window. Really Easy.. Use..... I have moved my iTunes folder over to the Drobo, and I am streaming from my iMac in the den (where the Drobo resides), to my AppleTV in the living room. Strage is currently at 1.9tb. No hiccups... perfect stream.. Design..... This is the only area where I believe some of the other manufacturers get higher marks for "Quality". The Drobo looks sweet...!! Don't get me wrong... it looks awesome sitting next to my computer and speakers, and if I could upload a photo to this review, I would. But, my only complaint is the general fit+finish doesn't quite have the same feel as the Netgear, or Lacie..... probably more on par with Western Digital. The drive "trays" feel thin and plastiquey...... and the front panel is a little lightweight. Not a Deal-Breaker.. Conclusion..... I don't know how it works. I don't really wanna know how it works. In fact... I don't really care how it works. But, it does.... and it works well. Its fast enough that I would never have any complaints... quiet enough that I can't hear it.... and smart enough that I know not to ask questions. I realize its not RAID..... but it still feels safe, and frankly, it should after eating 1.3 of my Terabytes with its backup function.. Great Product, Highly Recommended for media freaks and storage geeks who aren't geeky enough to know better.. dougan..

Pros:. Innovative, easy-to-use and good performance.. 
Cons:. Needs a visible activity light.. 
Summary:. I was sitting on the fence until the 2nd gen drobo came out with firewire support. That convinced me to buy it since I mostly use Macs which have great firewire support. The drobo has been working great for me and I recommended it to a friend. My friend pointed me to this review as a reason he didn't buy one, so I thought I would check out the review. Strange review. I find it quite contrary to my own experience. The performance comments in the review are odd. I am getting much better performance than what the reviewer mentions. However, on a second read I noticed the comment about how cnet used 37,000 small files in their performance test. I guess the drobo isn't tuned for that kind of usage, but that should be ok for 99% of the world. I use the drobo to store media files and those are generally not very small. pictures, music, movies all copy to and from my drobo with excellent performance. I haven't noticed any drop-off from my iomega firewire hard drive. So I think that part of the review is a bit outdated. The rest of the review is just a hard to read mess. I think I convinced my friend to ignore the review and purchase a drobo. For me it has been invaluable. To have a storage pool that you can continually expand and also the sense of security in the data protection is definitely something he can use given the amount of media files he has.. Bottom-line? The drobo is a great product. Fast and easy to use. Looks cool on my desk. :) quiet. Can't say enough about how useful it is to have a single pool of storage that can store all my music, photos and movies. The one complaint I have is the damn activity light is hidden from view when the front panel is on. I really wish they exposed that through the front panel. It is nice to be able when the drobo is busy, but in the end that is a minor nit. The front panel attaches with magnets and comes off with a simple pull, so I can check activity light if I need to.. 

$$;
Pros:. nothing else like it and that is a good thing. you will fall in love with how easy it is to use and how useful it is to pool a large capacity storage device that protects your data from bad disks.. 
Cons:. Their update mechanism isn't pretty, but it works. Also wish the activity light was visible through the front panel.. 
Summary:. A great product. I never would have thought of using a product like this until the drobo came out. It is disruptive in that what was once only something highly technical people would be able to use is now available to the non-technical masses like myself.. As for the performance and reliability, I've had no problems with either yet. With copies it feels as fast as any external hard drive and I know all my data is safe, so it has lots of peace of mind. Besides, it is cool looking on my desk and I get a lot of people asking me about it. I think this is going to be a very popular device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, super easy to manage, grows as your storage needs grow.. 
Cons:. no integrated backup. 
Summary:. My experience with the generation2 drobo has been wonderful. The unit is perfect for managing today's endless growth of media storage we all require today. I started out with two 500GB hard drives and just added two more. As I was moving some home movie files to the unit one of the slots started blinking red. That means the disk in that slot has gone bad!! The drobo stopped using that drive and all my data was still available. I returned that drive for a refund and replace it with no data loss. What a great tool! I now have nearly 2TB of capacity and can feel good about the fact that the drobo will protect me from shoddy drives. Nothing short of brilliant.. And performance is great. I did some stop watch comparisons with a single disk iomega firewire drive I was using previously and the drobo is actually faster when reading data from it. About the same when writing. I am also able to do movie editing directly with files on the drobo, so it can work as a primary storage device. Nice!. My only knock is that it would be nice if the drobo management application had an integrated backup capability built in. However, I am using a filesync app I downloaded from the web and it works well with the drobo.. In summary, I find the drobo fast, reliable and the ability to increase (or decrease) your storage pool on the fly is great for managing day to day storage needs. Sweet product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, quiet and easy to use. 
Cons:. took a long time to get it shipped. 
Summary:. I used the original Drobo for over a year and it has been working flawless. Since I own multiple Mac and the new Drobo now has Firewire800 I decided to take the plunge and purchase my second. So far it is working beyond my expectations. I moved my USB only drobo to a DroboShare so I could use that as a central repo across all of my computers and decided to dedicate the firewire capable drobo as my primary storage for my new iMac.. Well, I can say this new firewire drobo is fast as hell. First thing I did was drag all of my iMovie files to it and it feels about 2x faster than the USB version. Then I tried doing some movie editing with the data on it and it was great. No different than when using data from my internal drive. Wow!! I then (for a test) did some copies off of it and it was going close to 50MB/s. That is terrific for a multi-terabyte storage device that protects me from a disk failure.. Way to go Drobo!!. 

$$;
Pros:. effortless to setup and use. 
Cons:. 4 drives is good, i really want to see 8. 
Summary:. I bought a 1st gen Drobo and was pleased. I ordered a 2nd gen unit and got worried when I found this review. Got my hands on it 2 days ago -- this review and reviewer are wrong on all points.. Timing file copies using Finder on a MBP, I consisently get 52-55MB/sec write speeds and and 36MB/sec read. USB speeds are 22MB writes, 25MB reads -- these are about 25% faster than my original, USB-only Drobo.. The reworked fan and cooling grills make this dead quiet. Even doing a prolonged Time Machine backup I couldn't hear any fan noise.. I think its a sign of sloppy work or bias that the reviewer mentions NOTHING about FireWire on a Mac. And he injects his personal opinion as fact when saying things like its expensive, it needs bundled backup software, or other interfaces. Competition in the market will decide those things, not sniping comments from a some Cnet dude.. 

$$;
Pros:. Firewire800 really improves the usefulness of the Drobo. I can now use it as the primary storage in doing my photoshop work.. 
Cons:. A network option would be nice.. 
Summary:. My experience with this second generation Drobo has been much different then this reviewer's. I have had a first generation Drobo for over 9 months. I really liked the 'simplicity' of management of the storage array. I have grown from 500 GB to almost 2TB with its brain-dead handling of inserting of new drives. This is by far the easist RAID array I have ever used.. The one draw back was it was rather slow on USB on my iMac and Vista systems. So, I purchased a DroboShare back in Feb and that has worked out well for backups.. Now I have just gotten my 2nd gen Drobo and on the iMac (Fw800) it just screams! I can open a raw photo in photoshop in 1/3 the time of the USB Drobo. It is fast enough to use for all my editing. I only have FW400 on my Vista box, but using IOmeter, I was still seeing read speeds of 44 MB/sec and write speeds of 32MB/sec.. This is a great improvement from Data Robotics!. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast and Simple to Use. 
Cons:. It's the best desktop array I've tried. 
Summary:. I've no idea what this reviewer was doing. Just in simple drag and drop tests I'm getting around 50MB/s (400Mb/s) on FW800 which is about the best I'm seeing for a desktop array (obviously a little less than a single disk drive but that's normal for any RAID array from any vendor although it's not clear to the reviewer). It's also tricky to know what he means by finicky. I just plugged it in and it's worked fine ever since. On windows you need to ensure you have the right drivers to get good FW800 performance. My guess is that the reviewer had something set up wrong? Also true that every RAID array has a proprietary format and this isn't something unique to Drobo although apparently also unknown to the reviewer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reliable, easy. 
Cons:. Expensive??. 
Summary:. I own the first gen Drobo and really like it. I don't notice the performance being slow, as it's a backup drive and runs only when I sleep. I've never had any issues with it. If you can handle the cost, I'd say it's a good solution.. 

$$;
Pros:. From what I can tell, it does everything they claim when it comes to protecting against a drive failure IF it's a hardware problem. Yes, it's very cool that you can hot swap volumes and easily, big plus.. 
Cons:. Major issue:The Drobo Dashboard can and will report it's self as "I am Healthy" and say nothing else while it is actually having problems. This requires a chkdsk to be run (by a person, not via robot). Corruption can occur while "Healthy".. 
Summary:. I?m overjoyed by a company making an effort to automate what are tedious and annoying chores. The device does many of the things that Data Robotics claims.. However, the hype that the company puts forth portrays a device that?s practicly bullet proof due to its proprietary software and functions. and the software can mislead a customer to loose data even when the software is all smiles and sunshine -"I am healthy". Not only should the mis-reported health issue be fixed, but the 'data robot' should, in theory, be able to monitor the volumes in this fashion along with its other duties so as to provide a more complete service. Who is this product for? It should match all of the hype that the company is generating about their product, or regretably, speak just as loudly about this weakness.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design, cosmetically pleasing, quite easy to use, good in theory. 
Cons:. Poor product execution, ridiculous price point, unreliable, proprietary RAID software isn't the best, lack of connectivity for price (should have everything, including NAS for this price!). 
Summary:. Wouldn't buy another one of these until the pricing becomes competitive and more options are fully integrated for the price point. You can buy other products (more reliable in many ways) for hundreds of dollars less that offer 4-5 bay NAS utility. Drobo under-delivers and is over-priced.. 

$$;
Pros:. Looks good.. Great concept.. 
Cons:. Does not behave as advertised and so far is not reliable.. Support folks are trying but struggling.. 
Summary:. Mine is unstable (1) spontaneous uncommanded shutdowns (2) often refuses to go into standby mode which is required for safe power down (3) speeds never exceed 12-13 MB/s with USB2 and usually drop over time with a large transfers,. DRI support folks have a positive attitude, but seem to struggle. (1) the firmware downloads and Dashboard downloads from the site are hit and mis - sometimes they just don't work (2) a number of links they have sent me were to things other than what was being referred to (3) they just don't sound surprised that it is flaky.. I bought this (at a premium to competetive products) because it was to be easy and reliable. So far it has been neither. I'll give DRI the rest of this week to sort it out, but running as it is I cannot justify keeping it because (1) it is a pain right now and (2) I don't trust it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Upgradeable without much fuss .... 
Cons:. Unreliable, slower then heck, and sounds like a vacuum when fans kick in .... 
Summary:. I have been using a V2 Drobo via the FW800 for two months and now the USB for two weeks. It is just too slow and unreliable for me to use anymore. I am putting it on Ebay tomorrow and I ordered a LaCie 5big 5TB NAS to replace it. I really wanted to like my Drobo. However, unfortunately, I must say that the Drobo is a complete piece of crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clearly a hip marketing division. 
Cons:. untrustworthy company.. 
Summary:. I had to come by and comment on this. HAD to. It was a moral imperative.. A tech colleague emailed me the comments here from lmorse532, Jurasic005 and johnwiley82.. He didn't tell me anything about the article just asked if I though the comments were odd at all.. Being a 22 year IT veteran and having read many business and technical documents I know how to read for style, and read for handwaving.. My response was simple:. "OK, so all the entries were written by the same person, and the person has little or no technical ability - so what?". Notice that all the comments started with "the reviewer is wrong", none of them went into a logical argument, and none actually go into any detail. REAL Tech geeks rant, we don't say the "review is wrong" we call the reviewer a "fornicating SCSI", insult his mother, and then ridicule his testing methods.. ...then my colleague told me about this article which he found while looking for backup solutions. He asked what I thought.. I read the article, and the comments suddenly make sense. It's just a stupid marketing geek trying to prop up a marginal product that got a bad review!. aww....muffin...did the bad man make your sugar daddy cry?. So I thought a little rebuttal was in order.. Dear Data Robotics and tloverro, I know you're listening: I SMELL YOUR MARKETING AND IT SMELLS BAD. This product might be good or bad, but your response here casts a pall of evil over your marginal product. Whining about a reviewer is unethical, lame, and just it cost you a potential customer plus everyone I refer.. Now I've attacked the comments here - maybe I'm wrong in presuming these are just pointless marketing voices? Here's the questions:. Where are the reasons?. Where is the tech debate?. Where are the test runs to prove it works or sucks?. nothing... just spam about lovin' the product.. ...so I googled tloverro and drobo. Found tons of stuff about him pimping for this product - even a video that would be at home in any listing of "top 10 used car ads". Nice voice there cupcakes, but you are WAY too excited about this product - I suggest a vacation.. ...so I figure I'll investigate this myself since I'm reasonably impartial. Oh, feel free to send me a note via my account here and I'll be happy to explain to you my credentials.. tloverro, please watch how a pro does it...oh, and take notes cupcakes:. Let's google Drobo review and see what's out there for first and second gen:. http://www.reduser.net/forum/showthread.php?t=3602 - first gen had quality issues. not good.. http://www.engadget.com/2008/07/08/drobo-second-gen-mini-review/2. -wow, they had the same reboot problems, but they noted it was an OK machine for simple home backups.. http://www.automatedhome.co.uk/New-Products/Data-Robotics-Launches-Second-Generation-Drobo.html. -notes that it is slower than it's competition, but is not too bad.. http://skyline.bosconet.org/pjohnson/blog/?p=490 - not bad, but slow and concurrent access is not good.. http://twipphoto.com/archives/593 - notes that it is slower then an external drive, but overall is faster than gen 1.. http://www.asitis.org/drobo-review - lots of flaws listed, considered a marginal technology.. http://www.maximumpc.com/article/data_robotics_drobo - considered it too slow, but cool looking.. http://www.amazon.com/review/RACBLHTPP1NZ4 says it's a waste of time and money.. ...OK so overall, the idea out there is that this is a product for non-techs to do backups, and is way slower than a normal external HDD. Most of the geeks in the know complain it's slow, and that it lacks a network port so makes a lousy NAS.. Why? Well in laymans terms it's got a lot of internal handling to do to. Makes sense. In reality, anyone with some basic knowledge can use an external drive to accomplish backups with higher speed. I'd recommend that.. What about the article? Mr Ngo explains that he had problems with the system rebooting, but did ask for and test a second unit. Frankly, if a company sends a defective version of a product out for testing logically they will get a bad review. Duh - don't send it out! Although Mr Ngo's results for USN -vs- firewire are a little odd he states that he clearly tried to make them work by contacting data Robotics and even tested other OS's. That's pretty thorough! even still, seriously dude, firewire is usually faster than USB, you should investigate why it's slower. Finally, I'd explain why an external HDD is faster and better before testing this box against it.. Since other reviewers had similar reboot problems and performance, I'd say the claims here are backed up.. So I give the article a 75%. Accurate, but would be a solid 100% if it went into the details of why the problems were experienced.. Overall, I WOULD HAVE given the drobo a 40% for it's trade-off of speed for simplicity, with some clearly quality issues... but the kind of marketing BS seen here in the comments warns me off entirely.. Drobo 2nd gen - 0%.. 

$$;
Pros:. Does what it claims.... but slow, but proprietary,. 
Cons:. Nothing can restore the data if there is a hardware failure. Guaranteed to loose your data, sooner, rather than later. There is no official recovery software. Takes DAYS to remap drives during failures . Better have a GOOD UPS.. 
Summary:. Nice toy, minimally built with low spec for what some may consider a critical device. This should never EVER be a back up device, just a big pool to manage data SLOWLY and immediately back up... errr. SLOWLY.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy for non techs. 
Cons:. slow for real work. 

$$;
Pros:. Shiny, bright blue lights. 
Cons:. Doesn't work yet. 
Summary:. My friend bought one and we tried to get it working for a few days now, without success, even after trying to get help from the company. Should have read the review first! Taking it back shortly for a refund.. 

$$;
Pros:. Shiny, black. 
Cons:. Cut me, bad service, prone to instability. 
Summary:. Before I begin, I want to say that the unit suffered from problems and would reboot seemingly at random, quite often.. I was keen to get this device up and running to back up my gigabytes of photos, as I am a professional photographer. I was willing to overlook the slow performance (in line with the review), and I even recommended it to a few of my peers, until about a week later when one of the hard drives crashed. Recovery of data on this thing is really miserable. I called tech support and was put on hold for over 2 hours. Then, when I finally got through, I was told that I had set it up wrong when I had clearly followed the directions. Even after following the advice of the customer service representative, I couldn't recover the data. Good thing that I hadn't deleted my photographs from my RAID array or I would be out years of work thanks to this product!. 

$$;
Pros:. If you lose a drive you can replace it and not lose your data.. 
Cons:. If the device fails there is no recovery - your data is gone!. 
Summary:. I would not recommend this product. If you lose a drive you can replace it and not lose your data. You'll spend days on the phone with tech support. In the end they won't be able to help you recover your data. It takes a long time to boot up and I hold my breath hoping to see data on every reboot. Must and I repeat MUST be on a power backup or you are asking for disaster. The fans are noisy. I hate this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. &lt;Can't think of any&gt;. 
Cons:. 1) The device is still slow, even the 2nd generation.. 2) It took the Drobo people 5 day to respond to my LAST support request.. 3) Support and yearly licensing is insane!. 
Summary:. You will have a better expereince if you buy from one of the big boys, Data Robotics needs to bake a bit longer. Save yourself the trouble.. 

$$;
Pros:. Look great. 
Cons:. Everything Else. 
Summary:. Product is like a beta product. CNet really is being generous with their rating.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice idea, err that's all I can say that's good.. 
Cons:. Firewire 800 is way slow. Not usable. It's even slower than the USB.. 

$$;
Pros:. none at all. 
Cons:. very bad product. 
Summary:. i agree with the review.
