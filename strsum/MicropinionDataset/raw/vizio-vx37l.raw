Pros:. Easy setup, great picture. 
Cons:. Nothing yet. 
Summary:. I paid $699 and I've had this tv for 6 weeks and it's only been turned off a couple of times. Other people complain about the sound quality. I've never had a tv with great sound through its own speakers, I always use a surround sound setup and this tv works great.. 

$$;
Pros:. color is fantastic, love to play videogames and watch t.v and dvds makes everything look clear and perfect. 
Cons:. the volume of t.v sucks but why use t.v volume when you could use surround sound.... 
Summary:. a great t.v at a very reasonable price....

Cons:. NOTHING AT ALL!. 
Summary:. WE ORIGINALLY BOUGHT A PHILLIPS 42" LCD TV MODEL#42PFL7422D/37 FROM SAMS CLUB. WE TOOK IT HOME AND SET IT UP AND IT JUST DIDNT SEEM CLEAR. THEN I OFUND OUT THAT THE HDMI INPUTS DIDNT WORK WITH MY DIRECT TV HD BOX. I THEN WENT TO COSTCO AND BOUGHT THIS VIZIO MODEL AND BROUGHT IT HOME AND PUT THE TWO TV'S SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE SAME HD FEED. HANDS DOWN, THE VIZIO BLEW THE MUCH HIGHER PRICED PHILLIPS AWAY! ($1193.93 AT SAMS CLUB) THE VIZIO WAS CLEARER SHARPER, MORE CONTRAST (DESPITE THE VIZIO BEING 1000-1 AND THE PHILLIPS BEING 8000-1) I WAS PLANNING ON BUYING THIS ZIZIO BUT DECIDED TO SPEND THE EXTRA $500 AND GET A BETTER TV. I WAS TOTALLY WRONG! THIS IS THE BEST PICTURE AND TV I HAVE SEEN FOR THE MONEY AND ANYTHING UNDER $3000. I PAID $750 FOR IT AND AM THRILLED. DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID, BUY THE VIZIO TO START AND SAME THE FRUSTRATION OF TAKING THE OTHER ONE BACK. I BOUGHT A WALL MOUNT AND DIRECT TV HD BOX AND STILL ENDED UP SPENDING $300 LESS THAT THE PHILLIPS! I GUESS LADAINIAN TOMLINSON KNOWS MORE THAN FOOTBALL WHEN HE ENDORSED THIS BRAND OF TV'S! TRULY A GREAT BUY AN GREAT TELEVISION!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture, connectivity,sound,PRICE. 
Cons:. none, and i've had this tv over a year. 
Summary:. this tv does an excellent job with standard definition cable.....but i recently got a bluray play and WOW......i can't even begin to describe....STOP READING REVIEWS AND BUY THIS THING, its definitly worth it. 

$$;
Pros:. great picture. great for gaming. overall a very fun TV. 
Cons:. haven't seen any yet.. 

$$;
Pros:. 2 HDMI inputs, onboard tuners for ATSC and NTSC. 
Cons:. Remote control has vol and chan toggles reversed in location. 
Summary:. I must honestly say I am impressed with the quality of this set. Great for mainstream LCD - only the really expensive ones have better black levels. I am quite impressed with the HDTV tuner on this set - it picks up and locks on channels better than the high def TiVo or a standalone Hi Def tuner.. For $799 at Costco with Costco adding a year parts and labor to the warranty with a 90 day return policy, it's hard to go wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. price, good picture, looks. 
Cons:. Vizio "nightlight" emblem that never turns off. 
Summary:. Great price, great looks and good picture...just can't really find any faults (except for the small button remote control)...great buy!. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture and 2 HDMI hook ups. 
Cons:. takes a few seconds to come on (minor). 
Summary:. This TV has a fantastic picture. The sound is good also. Read all the reviews. The price on the tv is the same as 32". Hook it up by HDMI for the best picture. I have a Oppo DVD player hooked up to it &#38; the picture will make you smile. I did alot of research &#38; the quality &#38; price is the right combination. The only thing I can say negative is the TV takes about 20 seconds to show a picture but I find this to be very minor. My next big TV will be the same brand.. 

$$;
Pros:. 2 HDMI, Different TV Modes. 
Cons:. Only thing that might bother me is the Vizio light in front of TV never turns off evern after power is off but reguardless it looks cool. 
Summary:. When I first saw this TV I saw the 720p/1080i and 2 HDMI and thought this was too good to be true. I then saw all the reviews here and decided to give it a chance over the other brand names. I paid $900 at Costco for this LCD TV.. The picture quality on my PS3 through HDMI is incredible. I am a huge gamer and going from a 27 inch PHillips flat tube to this I was blown away. I love the ability to customize the settings for color contrast etc.. Internal surroud sound is great. Although I do not see a setting for background volume this is definitely one of the best investments I have made in my lifetime. I know I will hit 10 of 10 here and I will get a pop up stating if I am sure...and yes I am 100% sure this TV deserves a 10 of 10 and if you have a problem with that you can email me! consolecrusader@gmail.com!. 

$$;
Pros:. Competitive features at a reasonable price. Impressive Picture and Sound. Attractive design.. 
Cons:. 2 HDMI inputs. Ports placed awkwardly. Only backlight can be adjusted in all but 1 picture preset.. 
Summary:. I purchased this TV after many weeks of diligent research. I wanted the biggest, best TV I could AFFORD. Initially, I thought I'd have to settle for a 32", which just was not BIG enough. Then a friend told me about the Vizio at his recording studio. I had barely heard of Vizio, and therefore did not consider it a wise purchase. Well, I was out of the loop because millions of people already knew what I was about to discover...Vizio rocks! I've only had my TV a few days, but I just love it. The picture was greatly improved by lowering the brightness and backlight, and I'm sure when I upgrade my Dish service to HD I will be blown away. The sound is bold and crisp. Even when the TV is off, it looks great. I thought the lighted nameplate would bother me, but honestly I don't even notice it when I'm watching TV and when it's off, the dim amber glow of "Vizio" makes me smile a little. I got exactly what I wanted for several hundred less than the big name TVs. To provide a balanced review, I will mention that a third HDMI input would've been great. Also, the placement of the various ports is awkward. Being underneath the cabinet requires you to practically sit on the floor and look up at the TV to get a clear view. A backlighted remote would be great also. Such minor details take nothing from this great TV. Thanks Vizio!. Updated. on Jan 8, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Attractive set. Great adjustability and nice picture clarity.. 
Cons:. VW37L (Walmart/Kmart Model) Lacks side composite input.. 
Summary:. I followed reviews, and saved cash for months on end before I purchased this LCD from Kmart a couple weeks ago. I absolutely love it. I think that Vizio has a quality product out there, and they definitely provide the most bang for your buck. This says alot from me because I typically stick with Sony products when it comes to home theater. Again, the feature set and quality are top notch, down to being able to assign names to your inputs in the menu screen. I am very happy with it, and have already recommended it to all of my friends.. 

$$;
Pros:. good sound, sharp picture, great quality, low price. 
Cons:. a little trouble with clarity when there are a lot of shadows in the picture. 
Summary:. I love this TV! Great quality, was inexpensive, and definitely a great buy! The clarity is really nice, the sound is good. very happy with this TV!. 

$$;
Pros:. The total package---sound, picture, features, appearance. 
Cons:. Large cheat sheet for set up not helpful enough. 
Summary:. I have read a fairly good number of the other opinions here and can agree with almost all of those that gave a 9 or 10 rating. Our previous analog TV was a Toshiba 36-inch---a real brute, weighing in at over 125 pounds! What a difference with the Vizio! Less space, better picture, just simply better everything! I had done research over the past year on LCDs and Plasmas (no thanks) and got opinions of co-workers who had recently took "The LCD/HD TV Plunge". The only very small negative here is I would steer away from using the big color fold out cheat sheet to set up the TV--that's just my opinion, as I was not able to get it to set up like it showed. The fold out did say that if it didn't work this way to go to Chapter 3 of the manual which is what I ended up doing. I have a combo Panasonic VCR/DVD player and opted to use the AV connection for that and it works and looks great! We have a Comcast DVR and the Digital Preferred Plus cable package. This also worked out very well with the set up of all the components. I would strongly suggest you invest the money for the HDMI cable (Wal-Mart has them for $26 or so), you won't be sorry. We could not believe the clarity of the picture in HD---Amazing! The one other neat feature of the Vizio is when you look at a regular digital cable station, you still get pretty decent clarity, not the fuzziness as with some other models when you go from an HD channel to a regular cable channel. That was pretty impressive! We are thrilled with this LCD TV and hope to be able to buy another Vizio sometime down the road for another room in our home.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good picture, easy install, 2 of each type of connection (component, composite, HDMI). 
Cons:. Unable to view multiple video screens in PIP... ie. can't see video 1 in a PIP on the video 2 screen.. 
Summary:. If you are a value shopper more than having the latest and greatest technology like we are, this is a great choice.. 

$$;
Pros:. P.I.P.; great picture; full-feature remote. 
Cons:. Remote is not ergonomically friendly; side-viewing angle not the best. 
Summary:. I was preparted to spend $1,800. for a high quality 37-inch HDTV. After several trips to stores to check out picture quality, the Vizio seemed the equal of the higher priced LCD TVs with higher (and apparently meaningless) contrast ratios. When I researched my choice on the web and in consumer literature, it became clear that the only 37-inch set at any price to have P.I.P. was the Vizio and it has the connectivity to suppport the P.I.P. In the end, I paid only $800. for a great picture. And I got P.I.P. To pay more, you gotta be a "sucker" or unable to read or just trying to shame your neighbors. But your neighbors will figure out you're a dolt if you pay twice as much for something not twice as good!. 

$$;
Pros:. Mainly Great Price! Followed by great Picture, then style and then features, all rolled into one nice looking unit,. 
Cons:. Some one once said volume wasn't that loud, maybe but i use it in bedroom and never crank it up that loud. Can't think of anything else.. 
Summary:. I feel so happy to have taken a chance with the brand Vizio which I seen by chance at Costco. I loved there return policy so I figured I had nothing to lose if I wasn't real happy with the picture and could just return it for more expensive set.. Not only did I fall in love with the high definition image, I ran out and bought the 52" Vizio for my livingroom as I could no longer watch my old, non HD big screen in there anymore after being spoiled by this set. The color after adjusting to my liking is perfect, I usually lower the color levels to make it look more lifelike. When I watch sports of some movies, it feels 3D, like I can reach out and touch the people.. Get this set if you want great tv enjoyment today and don't want to wait another year for prices on brand name sets to drop to these levels! Start enjoying today. Also regular tv looks great on this set also just make sure to adjust your cable box to upconvert the signal properly.. I'd have given it a 10, but I don't want it to get Vizio a big head so they start raising their prices.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good color, lots of inputs, optical out, HD looks amazing, picture controls, menus. 
Cons:. none. 
Summary:. I found one of these on eBay refurbed for around $575, and it is defiantly worth every penny. It is a lot cheaper than any other LCD of its size, and not one thing feels/looks cheap about it. The TV looks good, and is built well too. I really like the picture controls, you can tweak any and every setting to your liking, something you can't always find on the expensive sets. The UI is designed well, and very easy to use. The PIP is great, you can watch a game and play the PS2 at the same time. Since I get HD channels through my cable feed and don't need a cable box, the built in optical out is awesome so I can send the 5.1 feed from the HD channels to my 5.1 receiver, and it even sends the stereo feed from the SD channels out as well (There is also RCA stereo outs if you don't have a 5.1 system, but still want better sound than what the speakers on the TV can provide). The picture looks great, and it has a lot of features for the money, I would highly recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Color Rendering, Contrast Depiction, Size for money, Overall Quality. 
Cons:. Gradient Handling, Actual TV shape and color (Ugly). 
Summary:. In this price class, this is as good as it gets. After testing numerous TVs, this proved to be the clearest with the best quality.. It doesn't make everything as three dimensional as other more expensive TVs; however, it is awesome to watch a movie on this HD set. And that is all that matters. Movies are brilliant, and the rendering is usually pretty awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, great price. 
Cons:. I haven't found any yet. 
Summary:. Go buy this TV, if you need a 37 inch. It is really a great deal. Buy it at Costco and return if you don't agree. It looks better at home than at Costco also. If you are not a member, than spend the $50 to join, and then buy the set. My wife likes it better than my other set, and that is a Sharp Aquos!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great HD picture with good controls. 
Cons:. None found as yet. 
Summary:. I bought this refurbished for $650 delivered and what a deal that was. It's equal in picture quality to my more expensive 40" Sony. I love it!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. very easy installation, less than 10 minutes. 
Cons:. i havent been able tp program vizeo remote with comcast.. 
Summary:. I purchased the 37" lcd from costco for $745.. it is the best investment for pleasure that i have done for myself... I havent seen a better picture on any tv set..I also foumd on all the standard channels the picture is very sharp, therefore i am not getting HD.. I am telling you that if you want a near perfect lcd tv BUY VIZEO.. Whatever problems i read about here on the reviews , have been cleared up.. ROY. 

$$;
Pros:. Great HD quality as mentioned in the CNET Review. 
Cons:. Standard def could be better but not much.. 
Summary:. When purchasing try adjusting screen. Alot of showrooms increase the brightness to a near blinding level. You may want to even ask if some lights can be turned off.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Picture. 
Cons:. connections are on the bottom/back and hard to get at.. 
Summary:. Bought it at Sam's Club yesterday for $750! Setup is simple. More connections than you will ever need. Great picture, sound is fine. Add on warranty is inexpensive at Sam's if you feel you need it. Has pip, but you need out side tuner.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, picture quality, inputs. 
Cons:. looks smaller. 
Summary:. I originally purchased an older model vizio tv from sams club, after about 10 months the tv turned itself off. My wife was a little freaked by it, so since Sams Club has a 1 year return policy on Vizio tv's I decided to take it off the wall and returned it. I returned it without a problem, and then went to the electronics department and bought this model. WOW what a diffrence. This tv is made so much better than the older model For example,. 1- The mounting bracket screw holes are father apart so it hangs correctly on the wall. The older moder the screw holes were to close, and the tv would tilt.. 2- The screw holes are much bigger, so you can put a bigger better, more stable screw into it.. 3- It has more inputs on the tv. Most important is the hdmi input. The older model only had 1 this has 2.. 4- The new model has more ventalation in the back to prevent overheating. Even though lcd tvs don't ussually get that hot, but for some reason my family is unable to locate the remote to turn it off.. 5- One of my biggest complaints one the older model was the tv remote. You had to be directly in front of the tv in order to use it. The newer model works all over our room. I now switched to Dish netork, and use there remote anyways. They also made the remote light up as well.. 6- The vizio icon on the bottom of the tv lights up, which adds a little class.. In summary I believe Vizio worked on there downfalls, and corrected them. I had this tv for a few months. I do NOT believe on posting untill I tried the product.. It also was nice when I returned the old tv, and purchased the newer model, it was also $250 cheaper. Yep I got to keep the extra money. If you were looking at this tv I would strongly reccomend buying it from sams club. They have a 12 month return policy on it. Also the extended warrany (which I purchased) was only $79.00. If you were to purchased this tv anywhere else, the warranty would of been quite a bit more!. The only problem that I could possibly find is that even thought the screen is the same size it looks smaller. The reason why is because border around the screen is samaller, for a better look. I was use to my other tv, which the border was quite big.. 

$$;
Pros:. Incredible video, xbox 360 looks sweet, high def channels are awesome in 1080i and 480. 
Cons:. No problems with the television itself, Costco in my area did not carry a 42" LCD or bigger. 
Summary:. This HDTV is great, 1080i looks awesome. I'm running the audio through a receiver so I can't comment on audio, but the video is great. I have played xbox360 in the audio and it's also OK but I prefer my receiver audio.. I have researched many HDTV's over the time and I was set on buying a Samsung. But after seeing this in action at Costco I was sold. The price point and the quality is a steal, literally. I paid $799 + tax from costco. After purchasing I went to Target to look at the economical LCD's (Olevia?) and they did not compare AT ALL. This is a steal! CompUSA didn't compare either.. I am more than happy/pleased with this HD television, I only wish that Costco had the 42 LCD in stock because if they did I would have purchased it. They only had plasma and I wanted LCd. If I were to see the 42 or higher at costco I would purchase it on site and move this to the bedroom. This is a great product!!!!. Buy one if your looking to get into the HD game at a reasonable price with great quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. PIP, HDMI X2. 
Cons:. remote is very hard to hold on to when pressing PIP buttons. 
Summary:. My xbox 360 works in 1080P mode on this set!. Got it at sams club on 4-21-07 at $851.03 with tax.. Killer deal for 1080P. 

$$;
Pros:. 2 HDMI inputs, picture clarity, design, 1000:1 contrast ratio. 
Cons:. Odd shaped speakers, no DNR option. 
Summary:. Coming from a 27" HD-Ready TV, I needed something that would support my newly bought PS3 and internal tuner option. I'm one of those who think if it isn't made by Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, etc..then it's not that great or subpar, boy was I wrong. Like any TV, you can't judge the picture quality from the store, you actually have to configure it for your home. After tweaking it in the store, the quality was on par with Sony XBR TVs and Samsung's LCDs. Plus with the many good reviews, I decided to gamble and buy it, but not without an extended warranty. HD broadcasts on this TV are great, with very accurate color under Normal setting, and a very good black level. PS3 games and Blu-ray movies are even better. Vizio is an excellent example that your only paying the big bucks for the other TVs simply because of their name like Sony, JVC, and others. Highly recommended. 

$$;
Pros:. Compares great to more expensive models not just on price. 
Cons:. Very minor, but I had to get longer cables for my set up. 
Summary:. I placed this unit in a room with large windows and direct sun and have had NO problem with glare. I went and bought the 32" model for my bedroom after this one. Customer suppert was very helpful with a couple questions. Why pay twice as much with this GREAT TV.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has it all. Easy setup. I rate it a 9.0. 
Cons:. None so far, but it is early. Remote control buttons are small.. 
Summary:. This is my first HDTV. Bought it about a week ago. This is a great TV and a great bargain. I bought it at the local Sam's Club for less than half of the price of the comparable Sony. I only have basic cable and expanded basic with no box and the tuner on this TV pulls in channels I am not signed up for. One of which I was going to block but thankfully it disappeared on its own. I put 10 year old rabbit ears on the TV to check it out, in case the cable goes out and of course there are a lot less channels with no so great a picture but it brought in the local HD PBS channel with as good or better picture than the cable company's picture. Called tech support with prompt response by knowledgeable people with little hold time. We'll see how it works over time but at least consider it if your are looking for a TV. Editors have it rate too low.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellent picture, easy set up, good service and warranty. 
Cons:. stand is weak. 
Summary:. I felt I had to write this review because the other reviews helped me so much in deciding on this purchase. The first indication of the quality which was to follow was in the packaging and the brochures inside. Vizio is out for your business and they now have mine. The picture is excellent on a movie from cable that wasn"t even High definition. That is why i also purchased this one, because of the tuner (for HD and Cable) they said regular tv looks bad on a HD tv, it may on others but not on this one. I also read a review about the speakers. The problem is not the speakers but the dvd players sending of the signal. I bought a new rca dvd player and the sound from the speakers at 100% was too weak for musicals, so I took it back to walmart and bought a $49.00 Philips and the sound is so much better. You can not go wrong with the Vizio. 

$$;
Pros:. Had it for one week, no problemm good sensitivity and connectivity. 
Cons:. None found so far. 
Summary:. Great unit, use it over the air and as a computer monitor. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, easy remote, excellent picture quality, 3 preconfigured color schemes, and completely customizable color scheme too, excellent black levels. 
Cons:. So-so standard definition, buttons on remote a bit small, uses lots of electricity like most LCDs. 
Summary:. Bought this after careful consideration and research from CNET and Consumer Reports because I was wary of the "off-label" brand. I wanted a good price for the set and solid performance too. This is really a solid LCD HDTV. I've only had it a few months so my review on reliability issues is short, but I've experienced no problems. Setup was a snap, and with one push of a button on the remote when the set turned on, it pulled in all the channels and I was ready to go. Took about 5 minutes. So far I'm pleased with the color, look, style, menu functions, and signal processing of standard def programming (although this really could be a tad better). So for now, I have nothing bad to say and I do think it deserves such a high user rating...if only for the low cost of a big LCD HDTV.. 

$$;
Pros:. Greart Looks, nice configuration, great price. 
Cons:. Finding a cantilever mount. 
Summary:. I bought mine at Sam's with the extended warranty for a great price. I love this unit and the picture is awesome!! I did have problems finding a good cantilever wall mount that didn't cost an arm and a leg. Ending up getting a great deal on an OmniMount from a storefront seller on Pricegrabber.. 

$$;
Pros:. phenomenal picture, unbelieveable value. 
Cons:. speakers / volume is somewhat weak. 
Summary:. I have researched and waffled for nearly 2 years on purchasing a "flat screen" tv and I am so glad I waited for the prices to come down and that I discovered Vizio. I am typically a "sony guy" and specifically an XBR Sony guy and I just could not justify spending the extra money on the Sony this time around. This 37" Vizio was sitting between a Sharp and a Sony at Costco and I could honestly not tell enough of a difference in picture quality to justify spending more than double. Once I got it home and hooked up, I knew it would be exactly what the doctor ordered. The best part about it is that I have my better half convinced to get another one for another location in our house due to the picture quality and reasonable price. A victory for me and for guys everywhere! I will buy another one this week (with an up-converting DVD player) for right around $1000, yahoo!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, easy controls, great remote. 
Cons:. Speakers are tinny. 
Summary:. I am a pretty picky person, and I had done alot of research in the past on LCD TV's. But last weekend, I just decided to pull the trigger and get an LCD. We have built in bookcases, so the biggest one I could get was 37". I was at costco three weeks before and saw the VIZIO, then the price, and said "Holy sh-t!" The picture looked great, and the price even better. With all the available inputs, 2 component and two HMDI, it handles everything you could need. I turned it on and could not have been more pleased. If you are just the normal person, you will be amazed. I consider my self very technical, and I loved the TV. IMHO, most of these reviews for HDTV are horses-it! You cant tell a difference! They ALL LOOK GREAT!!!!! Save the $500-$1000 and buy accessories!!!!!!!. The sound stinks (speakers) , but I run my sound through my receiver, so problem solved.. Great TV...even the wife likes it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Price, excellent picture. 
Cons:. No Noice Reduction. 
Summary:. Bought this TV at Sam's Club, got it home and love it. It is a great bedroom television, as a compliment to my living room tv. Easy to set up and get going.... 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture for the money. 
Cons:. Speakers are mediocre, especially in surround sound. 
Summary:. If you're looking for a cost effective tv with HDTV capabilities, I don't think you can go wrong with this model by Vizio. My only real complaint is in regards to the speakers. They're awful. I turned on the surround sound effect and it was just flat out annoying . . .with what seemed to be a weak attempt at improving cheap speakers. So, I switched it back to stereo and tried to make the most of it by adjusting the bass and treble. It doesn't handle the bass well either. Leaving the adjustments somewhere in the middle with a slightly higher treble seems to make the sound coming out of this set bearable. For the money, I can't really complain all that much. I already own Vizio's earlier 50" plasma and bought the 37" for the bedroom. Transitioning to the lcd was not difficult at all since the picture is sharp, colors rich and the screen has a very pleasing nonglare feature. The set is light enough that I was able to place it on top of the dresser by myself. So. . .I'll invest in some speakers and enjoy the bargain.. 

$$;
Pros:. very adjustable in the settings and amazing O-T-A high def..... 
Cons:. blacks a little flat, but not flat enough to say no to this tv.....really no con's. 
Summary:. in my research this lcd popped up numerous times and when i finally did purchase it , i came home and in ten minutes was just in pure bliss. have seen many lcd's that don't really produce a picture that is trully stunning.....this one though...is truly that. 10 out of 10....for price based on features, its a no brainer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cost is great. Picture is perfect in HD and good non hd.. 
Cons:. Location of the manual power button.. 
Summary:. This tv has a clear picture in HD and is better than most name brands that I have looked at. Non HD picture is average and is nothing to right home about. For someone that wants a good tv this is the one. I have no complaints other than the location of the manual power buttons on the side. You have many possiblities to hook other things up to with this tv. It looks and sounds great. Mine is in a bright room and I have no problems seeing the screen from any angle. Just use the tips and tricks to zero in the color and it is great. This tv is easy to setup. I had it working in about 10 minutes. I recomend this to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality qam tuner works like a champ I get some premium hd channels for free .. 
Cons:. would like a flat black trim instead of a piano black. 
Summary:. I bought this at COSTCO baby what a DEAL. I love it great picture quality excellent price how can you go wrong. The panel is a lg philips panel. I just can't justify paying four or five hundred more for a name brand besides it is a huge upgrade to what we all have been watching for years. It also has a great warrenty way to go Vizio!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very good HD PQ, lots of inputs, easy set up. 
Cons:. None really. SD isn't great, but its SD.. 
Summary:. For people interested in buying this TV I want to clarify that I am giving a 9 rating because of what you get for the price.. IMO, Its not perfect or spectacular, but it is very nice. And when the broadcast is excellent the PQ is excellent. Discovery Channel HD is impressive on this set.. Out of the box my PQ was a little rough, but adjusting the settings made a world of difference.. My settings stay close to:. contrast: 74. brightness: 46. color: 36. tint: 0. sharpness: 03. color temp: normal. The backlight is usually around 30 because our living room is a little dark.. If you don't need the very best, this is an excellent buy. If you are on a budget, this is an excellent buy. I could not be happier because I am getting excellent PQ and stayed well within my budget.. If this TV were over $1500, I'd give it a 7 and would not be disappointed if I paid that much for it.. I am particularly impressed with the way my 480p DVDs look. Not HD quality, but now I am in no rush to get a HD DVD player. Monsters Inc looks great and Troy and LOTR looks pretty good too. Good enough that I'll gladly wait for the prices to drastically drop before I buy a HD DVD player.. I have no cpmplaints.. The set has a ton of inputs. I am only using two, but I know I am pretty well set for future purchases.. I use the RGB component cables for DVD and HDMI from my cable box to the TV. I have a Sony 5.1 surround sound system. The "theater experience" is good.. Plus, if I want to upgrade in a few years, it would make a great computer monitor or it would be nice on the wall in the bedroom.. For the money it is "Spectacular"! Its very good no matter what your budget is. I was on the fence for a while and I am very, very happy with this puchase. It looks nice too. I was afraid it would look cheap, but it looks almost elegent and seems very well made.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, picture quality, design. 
Cons:. Speakers (2 at 10W), not energy star, smal font on menus. 
Summary:. Just bought mine today at Costco. Paid $899 for the set which is a steal for a TV of this quality. For this price you could also get a Polaroid, but think the Vizio is better.. It only took about 10 minutes to set the TV up. That includes opening the box, setting the TV in place, and connecting the cables.. I had a Philips 32 inch LCD prior to this TV. It is amazing to see what a difference the 5 inches makes in terms of viewing pleasure.. Would recommend this TV to others without reservation.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very simple for a 60 tear old non techie to set up and install.. 
Cons:. That damn VIZIO light on the front. I'm sticking some black tape on that today!!! Make it on-off optional.. 
Summary:. The picture quality of standard DVD's hooked up with an inexpensive progressive scan Sony player and Monster cables is AWSOME!!! I couldn't believe it wasn't high-def. I would recommend this set to anyone who is a cheapskate but wants High end quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture from any source. 
Cons:. the stand is a bit flimsy. 
Summary:. I just purchased this TV and am very pleased overall. Right out of the box, I could tell Vizio takes little steps to satisfy its customers, like providing a lttle lint cloth for the screen and printing a nice full color manual. I plugged the comcast cable directly into the TV (no digital set box), and hooked up a DVD player with HDMI connector, and I was in business. The TV automatically found all the standard cable channels and tuned in about 8 airwave channels, some of which are definitely HIDEF and look great. This was a real surprise, that I can get terrific HIDEF images over the tuner without cable. (OK, so this is my first HIDEF TV.) The standard analog channels all looked smooth, not grainy at all.. I reduced the backlight and set the custom color controls for best picture as indicated in this CNET review, and watched a Star Wars DVD upconverted to 1080i (which the TV then downconverts to 720p?) and it looked terrific. I just plugged in the HDMI connector, set the Vizio to widescreen and the TV did the rest. (I noticed widescreen looked much better than zoom. Zoom fills the screen completely but must add more processing). At no time--from DVD, air, or cable did I notice any pixelation or video noise whatsoever.. Yes,the contrast was a little better on my old 31" CRT, and I have seen "blacker" blacks on plasmas and the very best LCDS, but overall the widecreen and higher resolution make for a much better viewing experience than a standard TV, and the scenes from star wars in space looked black to me, not grey. The colors and shadow detail all looked good and bright to me, even after I spent hours looking at Panasonic plasmas and Sony and Samsung and Sharp LCDS in the showrooms, which are considered "the best" and rigtly so. But I believe this TV really can stand its own against them and for the money, it definitely deserves the "best buy" that it rated in a recent pcworld review.. The remote is nicer than I expected, it has small buttons but is backlit and has a very nice feel to it. My only nitpick is the stand is a little flimsy, and I would prefer a black back to the white, but all in all it looks real good and the little logo on the front looks so nice, you would never guess this is a "budget" TV. I'm happy. Go get one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Best tv we had!. 
Cons:. I cant think of any. 
Summary:. I bought this tv about a year ago and couldnt be happier. I was looking at several different brands and this one was the cheapest. I am very happy with my purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. great HD picture quality. 
Cons:. blacks could be darker, volume. 
Summary:. This tv is the best that I could find for the price. I researched a lot of tv's and found this to be the best. I have two complaints, the blacks could be darker and the volume while on HD channels is very low. This could be the carrier and not the tv but I have no comparisons. While on HD channels, I have to have the volume on almost 100, there is barely a subtle difference from about 70-100 on the volume. On normal non-HD channels the volume is very nice. I am getting ready to get a surround sound unit since I can not hear some movies on HD. I am really impressed with this tv and will be purchasing another one in the near future for the bedroom. I purchased mine at Samsclub for a little cheaper price. Overall a great tv for the price, obviously the more you spend the more you get, but if you want a great tv for under 800 dollars, this is the tv for you.. 

$$;
Pros:. Value, HD Picture, Features, 2 HDMI inputs, In home warranty!. 
Cons:. No so great on non-hd channels, but that is most big tvs?. 
Summary:. I bought this tv from SAM's for a great price, I went to Circuit City first, even though they are higher, to give them the opportunity to price match, well after 30 mins of waiting and NO SERVICE(this happened twice) we left and went to SAM's and got it. I really wish Best Buy sold VIZIO's, they have excellent customer service. DO NOT WAIST YOUR TIME AT CIRCUIT CITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. price is very low, attractive cabinet. 
Cons:. picture quality and sound mediocre. 
Summary:. very good for the price. 

$$;
Pros:. Rich, deep colors (with proper settings). Decent sound. Nice design as the silver base "lifts" the unit giving it a higher, better viewing profile than most of the competition. Exceptional Value.. 
Cons:. All 3 preset modes (Standard, Movie, Game) are pretty bad; the colors are dull and wahed-out, backgrounds gauzy, definition mediocre. But this is easily corrected. That's about it.. 
Summary:. I bought mine at CostCo for $749, which was $150 less expensive than the next one up the food chain, a Toshiba for $899. Sharp and Samsung were both at or over a grand, Sony was in the $1,200-plus range. The Toshiba picture actually looked the best of all, but only because the displays were all using one of the preset modes, in the case of the Vizio, THE weak link. When I got mine home, I started tinkering with the settings under Custom and almost immediately, by just more or less changing the settings at random, produced a picture superior to any of the presets where all of the people seem afflicted with jaundice and the backgrounds are relatively muddy and dull. A few days of this and I now have a picture that seems as good as that of the Toshiba, as I recall it. The result, in my view (and I realize that this is all highly subjective), is a picture that had rich, deep colors and a lot of "pop" to it, almost a 3-D quality. When I cycle through the 3 presets and then onto Custom, it's like I'm instantly looking at a different, much better TV. Also, in spite of much of what I've read here, I find the sound more than acceptable. No, not home theater quality, but certainly decent enough.. Here's what works for me, and the resulting picture could easily be tweaked to warmer or cooler or whatever by fine-tuning a few of the settings.. Backlight: 50. Brightness: 38. Contrast: 70. Color: 56. Tint: 0. Sharpness: 4. Red: 145. Green: 152. Blue: 144. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent price, good hi-def picture quality, good picture adjustment. 
Cons:. Not-so-good styling, not a brand-name, remote sometimes unresponsive. 
Summary:. Seriously, for its price, this television is the number one choice for generally low-budget consumers like me. I bought this TV mainly to play games on my PS3 and my 360. The TV does a decent job in rendering every pixel at 720p. Watching blue-ray movies is also extremely good with eye-poping colors and awesome picture adjustment.. Wish that Vizio put one more HDMI input to the side and redesign the front of the TV, leave it uniformly black. The remote control is sometimes very unresponsive.. Overall, this TV is a great value. 

$$;
Pros:. PRICE PRICE PRICE PRCE. 
Cons:. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles you might get with more expensive sets.. 
Summary:. For the price, you can't do better. Got this at Christmas time and have had it for almost 7 months. No problems and picture still looks great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Value for the price can't be beat!. 
Cons:. None, really. 
Summary:. I've lived with this tv for almost three months now. I still love it! The picture and sound quality are very good. The connectivity is fantastic for a television of this price. The only thing I might change would be to buy the 42" set. Only because bigger is always better!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great for the XBOX 360 or PC moniter.. 
Cons:. Horrible when compared to another television but it's a bargain price, so it's expected.. 
Summary:. I only use this TV as a monitor for my home computer and an XBOX 360 screen. Great for the HD experience for the 360 but when watching local tv, the tube seemed better.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome picture, connections, ease of setup. Customer service is great.. 
Cons:. As you have read before the sound might be a drawback.. 
Summary:. This TV is amazing. Well worth the price. I have read many reviews and most of them have been spot on. You really can't beat this tv. Only problem is the sound, and it isn't as horrible as it is portrayed. In the store, which it was a very loud warehouse store, the sound was almost inaudible. I played with the bass, and treble settings trying to hear it, but in the end I decided I would just have to take it home to see if I was happy. Right out of the box the thing was a cinch to set up. I really can't describe the sound, but it's different. Not great, not awful but different. It's adequate for occasional listening, but not for a die-hard tv or sports enthusiast. Short answer if you don't have one already, take the money you saved on this tv and buy a surround system. The remote is back-lit and easy to use, there are more than enough connections. I will be buying Vizio again, you can count on it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy setup, All the HDTV hookups and two HDMI inputs. 
Cons:. Vizio light on front needs on -off option. 
Summary:. If you want a HDTV that looks good and works, here it is. I researched a lot of HDTV's, most very expensive. I was very skeptical about this one, never heard of them before, but this one has all the good stuff for the best price I could find, and the're made right here in Costa Mesa, California, USA!. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of Inputs, Great Picture, Awesome Warranty!. 
Cons:. Non-digital sound not so good, Sub-Par Standard definition. 
Summary:. Awesome product! Simply put: if you can find one, buy it. There are so many inputs on this TV you won't have enough items to hook them up to. The sound output to your receiver isn't so great... unless you get the digital output. The picture is superb for High-Def or Enhanced-Def, but the picture quality for standard definition (RF and composite) is not that good. You can watch it, but it seems like you are constantly viewing something immediately following the Super Bowl halftime show (i.e. Dim and Cloudy). Other than that, if you have the High-Def hookups, this is the best deal for your money you can find.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price, excellent HD picture. Wonderful picture quality. Would definitely recommend. HDMI x 2. 
Cons:. none for the money. 
Summary:. For the money you can't beat this television. I would highly recommend this product. I bought it at Sams club for $899.00. I can't see the difference between this tv and the major brands other than paying a lot more. You also get a second HDMI connection with this t.v. which is a rarity with a t.v. at this price, and in general a rarity.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price is the biggest pro in the size/class it's in, price is excellent. Picture quality for hi-def is also quite good.. 
Cons:. More adjustments, even if they were buried in a menu somewhere, would have been nice. Being able to force the image perspective would be nice. PIP between all the inputs would be nice.. 
Summary:. I got this TV for my parents for Christmas. Anything would have been an improvement over their 20+ year old 20" tube, but this was a big step up. The size is perfect for small to medium sized rooms. THe picture is very good for HD shows. The sound is good, too.. For the price, I think it's a very good value. If you take price out of the consideration, it's still solid, but not a leader. THe HD picture is good, regular digital signals are good. Analog signals are watchable, but not especially great. Their implementation of PIP isn't very useful. But most of all, I wish there were more options to manually override aspect ratios for content, to force things to a perspective you choose instead of one of several options the TV gives you based on the signal. It would also be nice to manually set up digital channels instead of relying on the auto-find feature - manually overriding would be nice if, say, you wanted to set it up before you got your roof-top antenna set up because the set-top one isn't bringing in some far-off channel yet. But, again, for the price what they do offer gets the job done most of the time. I'm very satisfied with the purchase and do recommend it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Had every input imaginable. 
Cons:. Remote felt cheap. 
Summary:. I had bought this TV a month ago and had fallen in love with it. Unfortunately after a few day sof heavy gaming I had to return to Costco after a few dead pixels showed their ugly faces. Since then it has been impossible to find the TV in my area So I was forced to try a few other brands and none of them had the picture or the inputs like the Vizio VX37L even though they were a few hundred extra.. As soon as a new shipment hits i will return my present TV for the VX37L.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great colors, sharp, easy set-up!. 
Cons:. None yet.... 
Summary:. Just picked up the VX37L from Sam's Club. I was looking for a reasonablly priced, 37" LCD with dual HDMI inputs. After reading numerous positive online reviews of the Vizio products, I went and saw one for myself. It meets all my needs for an affordable price.. Hell, I was impressed with the box it came in - nice, glossy finished and well constructed. The documentation is first rate, written in actual English, and easy to figure out. The quality of the printed materials was also very nice.. Set-up was plug and play. The TV looked great from the moment I turned it on but was able to finely tune the picture easily.. Performance on the local HD channels is outstanding with smooth transitions, great color, saturation and sharpness. Even the standard def channels look great.. All in all, I'm quite happy with the TV. Of course, the warehouse clubs still offer great return policies and extended warrantees are available for reasonable prices.. For $899, you can't go wrong.... Bill. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful picture, easy set-up great price (from Costco).. 
Cons:. Unit died after one day! Screen went black and set shut down. Unit wouldn't turn back on. Returning set tomorrow to exchange for a replacement of the same type and model.. 
Summary:. We were very impressed with the picture quality of our new set. Unfortunately, we picked up a unit that was defective. We liked it so much for the day and 1/2 it was working, we are willing to give Vizio a second try and will be exchanging the unit for another of the same type. The included HDMI cable makes for an easy setup.. 

$$;
Pros:. price, good picture, and visually appeasing. 
Cons:. wish it had a few more ports, picture is great. 
Summary:. i bought this after my old projection 52" died. At first i was a little skeptical about losing screen size but the quality made up for it. i will be buying the vizio 47" when i move to a bigger home. 

$$;
Pros:. More than acceptable Picture quality - Pretty decent SD image. 
Cons:. Sound below par, remote quite unusable. 
Summary:. Got this from Costco - 3 days ago. Setup took 2-3 minutes. Picture quality is very good. A friend has a Sony Bravia 40inch and I cannot make out any difference (may be I am not a "videophile" - but works for me). SD in wide mode is perfectly acceptable. HDTV is not yet setup but DVDs are excellent.. Sound is definitely below par - my Sony 27 inch CRT has much much better sound - but I mute the TV and route sound through my receiver so it's not an issue for me.. The remote is really bad - after three days I still need to search for the input button. Will update once my HD gets set-up. 

$$;
Pros:. brilliant colors, great price, good sound. 
Cons:. blacks are not very true, fast-moving action can get blurred. 
Summary:. i love this television...i shopped for months and decided on the vizio for the price...hd programming comes in great...i would buy another vizio t.v.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good HD picture. DVD's look very good. Tons of hookups.. 
Cons:. Weak sound, standard analog picture, and aspect ratio could be tweaked for better image stretch.. 
Summary:. Overall I rate this TV as a 7 (very good). In terms of price it's a 10 ($799.00 at Costco). The HD picture quality is good, though not as good as my Sharp. Viewing DVD's on my upconvert player is wonderful, and digital cable picture quality is very good. Also, there are a wide array of picture adjustments that let me tweak the red, green and blue scales. Finally, the set looks very stylish, does not reflect glare, and can be viewed from anywhere in my living room.. I did not give this tv an excellent rating(8) because the sound is rather weak and almost tinny. For movies I definitely need stereo hookup. Also, the aspect ratio of wide makes everybody too wide, and panorama causes funny edges. This is not a problem when viewing widescreen dvds or other wide formats.. Bottom line for me: I don't want to spend hundreds and hundreds more for a 37" Sony or Panasonic. I'll save that money, get a decent surround sound system, and watch all my movies at home (popcorn's better).. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture is equal to 37" 720p compitetion but costs significantly less. 
Cons:. Typical LCD issue with less than steller blacks. 
Summary:. In the master bedroom where I've forced my wife to watch TV, soshe can Tivo girly crap in there and it doesn't confict with my manly recordings on the BIG TV. Plus she likes it in there. We had a 38" RCA CRT HDTV with built DirecTV, which really looked good, but weighed close to 250lbs and won't fit in any furniture and probably can't be hung on the wall, which she wanted.. So I went over to Costco and was actually going to pick up the 42" Panny plasma, but it wouldn't actually fit in my car. So I looked at the LG, Sharp, and Vizio 37" LCD's, I'd have picked up the Panny 37" Plasma if they had it. Once I adjusted the brightness, sharpness, and colors to a slightly more sane config, all looked pretty similar under the lights, the LG probably the worst and I couldn't tell the difference with the other two, so the Vizio was it. Basically $899 vs $1199 and equal performance is a complete no brainer, only $200 more than the 32" Vizio.. I should have got a commission since they had a giant pile of 32's by the front door that people were picking up, I told like 10 people that the bigger one was only slightly more expensive so they switched, and then Costco ran out.). Once I got the set home and hung on the wall, which was a HUGE pita, it actually looks really nice, as in styling. They've rounded it a bit so it's somewhat more streamlined than the competition, which doesn't make the picture look any better. With HD DVD and DirecTV the picture looks quite good. With DirecTV's HD Lite picture 720p really is about the best your going to get. HD DVD is better, blacks still don't really exist on this set, but with the lights down and the backlight toned down you can see a fair amount of black (read dark grey, charcoal really) detail. The old CRT looked better in my opinion, I don't think it resolved as much detail but it was really smooth and film like. I've really noticed that the CRT had quite a bit of overscan and the Vizio shows a pit more of the picture. So that's about it, great value, picture is competitive, why would you buy something else in this category? Sony has some 40" 1080p's but for more than 2X the price there is really no way to justify it at any normal viewing distance, over this unit.. On a side note, the Plasma's do look significantly better than LCD. Not really the resolution, as LCD's are typically one step higher in each size, 1024X768 vs 720p and 720p vs 1080p. But the black levels are much better, so much better that I've decided to not replace my 61" CRT rear projection with DLP or LCos (JVC's 61FN97 was my choice), I'm going to go with the 58" Panasonic plasma. Of course, I'm not buying till March, so I reserve the right to change my mind and go REALLY big, like 70", more power.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, picture quality. 
Cons:. Irratic sound. 
Summary:. Not certain if sound variations are due to the stations or programs but they vary greatly from station to station or program to commercial. I feel if one sets the volume at 20 that the volume should be the same 20 no matter what the station or program. 

$$;
Pros:. Good HD picture, Attractive. 
Cons:. No RCA audio output, can't access wide mode. 
Summary:. I bought this TV at walmart a few days ago. I had considered buying it at Circuit City, but they're model is different looking. It's got silver speakers and a the frame is very white. Walmart's model is all black. Anyway.... The HD picture is good, but it seems that I'm constantly tweaking it depending on which channel I'm watching. This is quite an annoyance.. Maybe it's just my cable company, but I can't access the wide mode (adjust SD picture size) at all. I'm running and HDMI cable from my HD DVR box. The TV seems to think that all broadcasts are in 720p, which is obviously not the case. And since the TV thinks it's receiving an HD signal, you can't adjust the picutre. So to adjust picture size on SD, I've got to do it through the Advanced Video option (I like to stretch my SD pictures). So when I go back to HD, it's distorted. Major pain for me.. Also, there's no RCA audio output. There is only an "optical audio output", which seems to look like a phone jack. My stereo doesn't have one of these, so I have to run the audio out from the cable box. Not a big deal once I figured out I could do it, but if I ever go without the box I'm porked.. Overall, I guess you get what you pay for. The price was great, but it's got some major drawbacks. I'm actually thinking of replacing it with a smaller, name brand model just to stay in this price range. I'll tweak it for the next couple of weeks to see if I can get it where I want it.. Hope this helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Value. Not cheap looking. Remote w/backlight. RED, BLUE, GREEN Calibration.. 
Cons:. Sound is muffled. Menu is ugly.. 
Summary:. I got this tv refurbished with a great price. Best value compare to other 37" LCD TVs Picture quality is good but not great. Almost no glare. Blacks are okay with a purple-ish color, but turning down the backlight improves the blacks a lot and calbrating it w/ CNET's settings reduce the purple-ish black color significantly. Picture quality lack some details seen on other bigger brand names. Picture is not sharp enough and turning on higher sharpness introduces artifacts on some pictures. Colors are very good. Sound es mediocre, but it has analog output to your speaker system. The ATSC tuner is very sensitive, it picks up channels very well. I recommend this to anyone who do not want to speed too much money on a TV. I feel that this Tv gives you more, in terms of performance and design, than many budget TVs out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works fine in dark room.. 
Cons:. Not so good in a little lit ambience.. 
Summary:. I just bought this set at Costco. It's a good deal for 37" TV. I'm pretty happy with the picture quality at night/or in dark room. However, Didn't look all that good during day time. I guess, It could be this TV or maybe other LCDs too.. As mentioned in CNET review, Picture quality is quite acceptable, but not exceptional. Color vividness is missing. If you can spend $400-to-500 more, Samsung would be a right choice. Otherwise, this TV rocks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture, easy to hook up.. 
Cons:. Vizio's customer service doesn't exist and their authorized service company's customer service is even worse.. 
Summary:. The TV died 2 days after extended warranty ran out. TV would turn on but didn't get picture. Couldn't turn TV off w/o pulling plug out of the outlet. Contacted Vizio and they had me contact their authorized service provider, ITI, Inc. in San Jose, CA. Took them 3 weeks to get someone out to repair TV and when repairman opened the parts up, they sent the wrong part. Now it's been 3 more weeks and no part, no repair. ^ weeks running and I still have a TV not working.Tried contacting Vizio and ITI but no one can give me a straight answer. I don't care how great a TV Vizio makes, I will never buy another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Picture looks good. 
Cons:. Electrical popping noise. 
Summary:. I bought this TV as a manufacturer refurbished product from Tiger Direct.COM. The TV came delivered with scratches on the black border around the screen &#38; the internal speakers were making a electrical popping noise. I called Vizio immediately, wait time around 20 minutes to speak to a Customer Service Rep. The initial VIZIO CSR said the TV was probably mishandled &#38; started to set me up with a replacement order, but needed me to fax my receipt. It took 3 days to get my fax in because I was giving the wrong fax number &#38; I guess the VIZIO's phone system was messed up for a day. Ten days later I received my replacement with worse scratches on it's black border &#38; the screen was also scratched. At this point I felt I had invested a good amount of my time &#38; money &#38; was not going to invest anymore, so I called VIZIO and returned the replacement TV &#38; told them no need to send another. Lesson learned, because I could of gone down the street &#38; bought a similar brand new TV for $50 more that day &#38; had the stores support &#38; saved a month of my time. I just hope the TV doesn't catch fire and burn down the house.. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture - easy setu. 
Cons:. speakers periodically crackle - idiot came to fix. 
Summary:. We've had 3 of these now and all of them have the same problem - the speakers crackle. I tried turning the surround feature off - didn't change it. Called Vizio to see if they could fix the problem - spent over an hour on the phone at various times, finally got a service guy, who couldn't find my house after getting directions 5 times, when he was only 3 blocks away, brought the wrong parts and messed up my dvd player and surround sound. ANyone else have this problem and get it fixed? 3 times is ridiculous.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price is great. DVD viewing was great.. 
Cons:. Standard Def picture is grainy. Audio was terrible.. 
Summary:. If you plan to watch DVD's and nothing else this is your LCD. I do not have High Def in my area yet, so I use Standard Def digital cable. It seems to me when cable complany offer HD it is only a handful of channels. SD picture quality is important to me. Picture is very grainy, some channels are better than others. Audio is weak. Some channels w/the audio on the highest setting is very difficult to hear and I have a small living room. DVD viewing was great. picture was crisp, colors seem to be accurate to me. No issues with audio on the DVDs I have watched, Gladiator and Braveheart. I am returning this set to Costco today. I am not sure what I will buy next.. 

$$;
Pros:. Worked fine until there was not sound nor picture.. 
Cons:. Neither Dell nor Vizio were sensitive to my problem. I have been a Dell customer for over twenty years. I had purchased two Vizios from them.. 
Summary:. I did not like the fact that I paid over $800.00 for this TV and that in less than two years I am told by both Dell and Vizio that there are no considerations that can be made and the TV cannot be repaired.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reasonably good picture. 
Cons:. Undependable. 
Summary:. I am currently in possesion of my fifth Vizio VX37L TV. The first four received were defective. Defects were verified by Vizio's own techs when units were returned to them. They also confirmed that defective units had not been misused or abused. Fifth set now in my possesion has a bad tuner. This was reason for returning fourth unit which had the exact same problem. I am retired from a nuclear engineering management position with a hobby of repairing home PCs so I feel that I am well qualified to properly operate a TV set. Vizio sent me a free wall mount with the fifth unit as a way of apologizing for all the problems experienced. Service tech that came to my home stated that Vizio had many dependability problems. Vizio is now too embarrassed to respond to me so I am stuck with a defective TV. Vizio is not inexpensive, they are simply cheap.. 

$$;
Pros:. Least expensive model in this range. 
Cons:. Poor picture quality.. 
Summary:. The picture was dark and if you turn up the brightness it just looks washed out. It also did not recognize Hi-Def signals from Wii and PS2. It looks like a bargain, but you get what you paid for!. 

$$;
Pros:. good picture quality. 
Cons:. made a loud pop and broke 10 months after purchase. called Vizio and set up a service visit. no show. they knew which part was broken (must break alot) but just didn't show up. now they just keep saying someone will call.. 
Summary:. this is the 2nd Vizio we have had break one in 10 months, the other after 13 months (the company we bought the 1st one from was horrified and allowed us to return the product). horrible customer service, product seems great at first but then breaks and thier repair company is unreliable. STAY AWAY FROM VIZIO!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Watched it for about 1 year. 
Cons:. It's been in the shop 3 times. 
Summary:. Do not buy VIZIO without an warranty, and even then expect for it to be in the shop more often then it's watched..

Pros:. Very pretty when it's off.. 
Cons:. It doesn't work when it's on.. 
Summary:. There's a green haze/static over everything. I bought the tv in the beginning of June, it is now mid-September. It's worked for about 2 weeks. The first repair took over a month to effect; the technician claimed he was overworked, there weren't enough techs for NYC. He changed the motherboard, didn't care what the problem was but said "this oughta fix it, it fixes everything. If it doesn't, they'll replace it." The tv worked for about 2 weeks. I emailed tech support, still waiting for a reply weeks later. I called them about a week after I emailed, got a new case # and was told I'd get a replacement in 7-10 business days. It's been 13. I called back, was on hold for 20 mins before I got to speak to a tech. Insisted they escalate immediately. Another 20 mins on hold. Gave case #s and was told "O, I don't see tracking for that, let me contact customer service." More holding. I'm pretty upset at the prospect of them sending me a "B-grade tv" to replace the brand new one I thought I was buying. The customer service person said they were holding shipping because they had no credit card on file! I said "why didn't you call and ASK for one???" She told me they noted that they had spoken to me about it (which they hadn't) and after I gave her the cc#, she said it would be "7-10 business days." I said "nonono, please be thoughtful about this; clearly that's a standard answer. How long will this take?" To her credit, she thought it out and claimed the new tv would arrive by the end of next week (this being Thursday evening). What do people who don't have credit cards do when their tv breaks??? Don't buy this dog of a tv. I'll do my part and pepper the world with my review so no one else is seduced by how pretty it is in the store and how inexpensive it is. You don't EVEN get what you pay for here!.

Pros:. Cheap,I can't think of any,. 
Cons:. Bad customer service, unreliability, Cheap quality. 
Summary:. Unofrtunately you get what you pay for. And I think the only reason that anyone would buy this TV is because it's cheap. Yes you will pay less but the TV (at least in my experience) will cost you 30-40 dollars per month.. I just had to throw my Vizio in the trash because the picture doesn't come up anymore. If you think you buy this TV and is good for some years, think again.. Also try their customer service before you buy. their "level 2" are the rudest customer care people I have ever talked to.. I would recommend a known name brand with good support like phillips, sharp, sony,..Believe me not only you enjoy better picture you don't have to worry about upoor quality..
