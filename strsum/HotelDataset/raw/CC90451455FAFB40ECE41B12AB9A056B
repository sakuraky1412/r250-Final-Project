we stayed here again the last month with a small baby .
the check in was smooth staff hospitable as ever and were given priority everywhere as we were traveling with a three month old baby , we were provided with a baby cot in the room which was quite deep for the young infant and hence kind of not usable .
we made our baby sleep with us on the bed as he was not comfortable in the cot .
nonetheless the cot was very well setup .
as for the room its a tragedy that the management cant refurbish it due to some legal issues though the rooms look dated the leela guys make up for it with hospitable service all around .
coming to the restaurants , deepak at jamavar has been such a revelation and has changed the way jamavar operates .
hes got this typical rajasthani hospitality to jamavar .
am sure the management would be getting great results due to this man at the helm at jamavar .
they should actively consider making him the gm of the hotel to get the lost glory of leela mumbai back .
though we prefer jamvar all the time for food at the leela , tushar at citrus is equally good .
the food and hospitality more than makes up for the dated rooms and as reviewed earlier the open space at the hotel is an added advantage with a small family with kids .
i would term this as a . . .
