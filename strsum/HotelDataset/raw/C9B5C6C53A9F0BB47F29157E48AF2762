the reason i decided to stay here for the night was because i got to colombo at around midnight .
my plan was to go down south to galle but as the trip to galle would take 2-3 hours i decided to wait until the morning and stay the night in colombo .
the hotel itself was clean and tidy .
the lobby looks like it needs a bit of refurnishing but overall the rest of the hotel was up to standards .
the first thing i asked about after checking in was wifi access .
the front desk told me that wifi was free of charge for an hour in the lobby area and also in the bar on the ground floor .
access to wifi was chargeable in rooms .
that was fine as long as i had access somewhere somehow .
we checked in and quickly went for a bite in the bar .
it was quite late after checking in and it was a little bit after 11pm .
unfortunately , it took us almost 45 minutes until our food came and we only ordered two dishes .
alcohol was last order at 11:30pm and yet they claim to be a 24 hours dining and bar .
back in the room we wanted access to the internet so we can organize the trip for the next morning and made sure someone was there to pick us up at the hotel .
we called the front desk about 4 times before i could get someone to help me look at how i can get access from my room .
meanwhile i also asked if i could access it from the lobby area , where i was told wifi was only available in the lobby area until 11pm .
at last , i had to get a coupon code which took me about an hour and a half and about 5 phone calls to find out .
back at the restaurant the next morning , we wanted to order takeaway breakfast so we can eat something on the road .
we ordered a club sandwich and we had to wait about 35 minutes before it was ready .
i had neutral comments about the room itself as i do n't think there was anything good nor bad about it .
with the sort of amenities and service overall , i think this hotel is slightly over priced .
