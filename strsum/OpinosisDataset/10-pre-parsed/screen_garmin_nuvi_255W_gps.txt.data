sufficiently sensitive touch screen

> better screen touch sensitivity

the home screen shows four options :

screen is clear and maps are pretty easy to follow .

3 inches screen and steady performance .

also, push every icon on every screen you see .

3 inch screen was a slight improvement over my former 3 .

screen size is good and i didn't want one that had blue tooth and a lot of 'extras' i wouldn't use .

> more responsive that my old 760  , plus a better looking screen

> same screen size as the other 4 .
