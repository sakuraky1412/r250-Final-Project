super clean and easy to use product  .
there seems to be a ton of potential as well  .
i like that it can easily access all of my media on my computer (through itunes) as well as the netflix and youtube access  .
cannot wait to see what the future brings .
if you are looking to find this in the big    chain stores , you wo not  .
go to the apple store and buy it online    took about two weeks to receive from the time of ordering , but is worth the wait  .
this thing is fast  .
owners/users of the first generation appletv will really appreciate this  .
as soon as you rent a movie , play a netflix item , or stream something from your computer , its starts almost instantly , there is virtually no buffer time at all  .
(i'm on a 10mb down cable line)  .
the iphone/ipod controller function is a welcome and makes the remote that comes with it collect dust  .
i cannot wait to see when the airplay functions comes later this month , i will update my review again when i get the chance to play with that feature , but even without it i am still very happy with my purchase  .
best $100 i ever spent with apple  .
i do not usually review products  .
if i like it , great , if not , so be it  .
but i feel i need to make it known my feelings on this product  .
i got it today  .
i had it set up in under 5 minutes  .
the way it streams videos from the internet is unsurpassed  .
i recently subscribed to netflix  .
i also have a ps3 that i used to stream instant movies  .
with the ps3 , i often would have to wait for the movie to load , and during the movie , sometimes it would pause to load some more  .
but with appletv , i have yet to encounter that it also upscales movies to full 1080p hd  .
it also streams movies from the computer , much like front row i cannot wait until more companies sign on to apple to share their shows  .
it's not a question of if they will , but when they will  .
and it will add to the usefulness of appletv just that much more i didn't want to buy the original appletv  .
to me , it just seemed useless , pointless , and nothing that i couldn't do with a cable running from my computer to my tv  .
but the truth is , the picture and sound always ended up being joggy , and unwatchable if trying to watch a movie  .
while i will still have to do that when i want to put my computer screen up on the tv , for media , the new appletv cannot be beat  .
i bought it as an impulse buy , but now i cannot be happier with it  .
but i will say this  .
do not wait until they decide to hop on the itunes rental program  .
this , right now , is a great worthy product  .
but the addition of more programs and the coming update for airtunes , will only make this that much more valuable .
you cannot go wrong here  .
it's inexpensive , very fast , and rentals from netflix or the itunes store is flawless from a huge library .
in order for this to become a success , apple needed to get the price to $99  .
i think it's an impulse buy now for those buying a computer or even an ipad  .
with 8gb of onboard storage , we'll be getting apps on this and this will become the box that can do it all  .
any shortcomings on tv rentals will disappear as networks offer their own apps i own a lot of dvds that i've ripped and just want to be able to use on either tv (i have two 50 hdtvs) and i have a mac mini on one room  .
i like it but you still have to use a mouse and keyboard to get things started  .
also , the setup is too cumbersome to tote back and forth from livingroom and bedroom  .
the appletv however will very portable and i'll be able to move it back and forth with ease  .
mainly i just want to be able to stream whatever i have to either set and the atv lets me do this without any problems and is much cheaper than investing in another mini which is what i've been thinking of doing i think that apple has finally the hardware and software just right to get these into millions of homes  .
i think that with an app store , this would just be a magical device  .
the new apple tv is a terrific device that will only get better over time  .
when ios 4  .
2 enables full airplay functionality in november , the ios user base will snap up apple tvs by the millions  .
apple tv will be the must have accessory for iphone , ipod touch , and ipad  .
a perfect stocking stuffer once the user base is large enough , hollywood will be forced to cave and a flood of rental content will become available  .
apple's strategy is very crafty i own a roku (for netflix streaming) and a first gen apple tv  .
roku's user experience is awful  .
now that apple tv offers netflix streaming , i can replace two devices with one .
a small well designed device .
i got mine yesterday in the mail and is eager to set it up right away  .
i had done everything and is excited to see how my content in my itunes library looked on it  .
to my dismay , the apple tv only recognized my wife's computer which only has music on it  .
i got on some discussion boards to see if maybe my laptop needed to be connect to my airport extreme , which would've sucked  .
i found out that there is a new version of itunes that is required for the apple tv to recognize my laptop  .
i updated it and within a few minutes , i is basking in all its glory  .
netflix content looks great also  .
to the reviewers that are saying it's not full hd , you cannot tell the difference unless you are watching it on a super big screen  .
i have a 37 toshiba and it looks just like hd content on tv .
bottom line it's a great device and small around 25% of the size of the boxee unit  .
i think it will be a big game changer .
will probably purchase another just to get rid of the bad netflix interface on the other streaming device in the house  .
i'll be interested in how apple expands the functionality as the internal components are the same as an ipad  .
for $99 , it's a great device .
consider this a new product line with extremely low barriers to entry  .
more network deals and software updates will evolve this into a must have over the next 12 months  .
for now , this is one of the best ways to see your netflix instant queue on your big screen and if you don't mind using your mac or pc as a library , this is the best way to play your movies and music using your home theater now that i can so easily play media from my computer on the big screen , it finally makes sense to buy high    quality movies and tv shows with replay value from itunes as opposed to buying blu    rays/dvds first they got all my music purchases , haven't bought a cd in years  .
then they get all my gaming purchases through their app store       i've stopped using console and handheld gaming systems thanks to the iphone and ipad  .
now they'll get my movie dollars , too it sounds like the folks at apple have realized hat its about media spending market share  .
they cancharge $100 bucks for a cool new device ; the real money is in their cut of the $500 plus/year those folks will spend on purchases and rentals  .
and the customers do not mind , because we were spending it anyway  .
welcome to 2010 .
great price  .
easy set up  .
simple soulution for media through your ht system  .
i would have given it 5 stars if it would only get all the internet media available , as well as present all info that the programer provides  .
over all the unit is well designed and integrates well with the computers that i have .
i'm very happy with the product  .
i own two and we've been streaming netflix on them both at the same time without a hitch  .
i'm looking forward to more networks making their content available  .
i is surprised to find that some very current movies still in their theater run are available  .
those movies run $7  .
99 (hd)  .
all the other hd movies run $3  .
99 to $4  .
just bought apple tv today in canada  .
very positively surprised at newer version of this apple tv  .
i have used it so far in conjunction with netflix , and works like a charm  .
very easy to add an itunes library , setting up to a wireless network is hassle free , and cannot wait to see apple adding newer stuff later on with eventual software upgrades  .
so far i give it a good thumbs up  .
apple tv is worth the money in terms of looks , convenience and limited content  .
i hope apple will increase its sources and gives more content for free (or low cost) instead of grabbing for all th bucks .
bottom line is that this would be a nice product for streaming my iphoto and itunes music  .
it's incomplete , though , since it will not transfer most of my video collection  .
and the itunes store is frankly a joke  .
netflix is the solution here , so i'll probably stick with the hiccups i get from the software solution i've found in medialink .
attention    apple tv  buyers don  .
t be fooled  .
s not full hd  .
s only 720p (not 1080p) , which is a waste if you  .
re buying it for full hd  .
wait until the full hd model is released  .
don  .
t waste your $$$ just yet  .
why would apple do this and give us only 720p  .
so i originally is buying this for my dad at the apple store in nyc and the salesman came up to me and started to gushing over how it is so small  .
i asked him what it could stream and how it is better then the 1st generation and he had nothing to say besides the form factor  .
this conservation could sum up all of apple's products if energy bills are a huge deal , this little guy is great because it only uses 6watts of energy  .
the size is the most impressive aspect of the device  .
the 1st generation is roughly the same size of the new mac mini  .
the price is great until you realize the the roku box is the same price and has many more streaming options i decided not to buy the apple tv and bought a refurbished apple mac mini for $600 , i figured you will most likely pay $60 for a dvd player , $100 for apple tv or roku , and $440 for a computer that can burn and rip dvd/cds , play almost any kind of audio or video , gives you multiple media playback options , can store all of your movie/pictures/music , and it is in 1080p  .
now everyone does not need or can afford a $600    700 media streamer but in my case i use it as a desktop as well .
if you have lots of video and music on your home computer/network then it's great as a streaming device with optical and hdmi output  .
but as a stand    alone rental device for movies/tv shows it is is quite simply appalling  .
why  .
limited selection of overpriced rubbish available  .
disappointed in apple to get the hardware so right but the software so poor  .
and this is from me , an apple fan of 20+ years (yes , i did use to sell lisa computers as a saturday job  .
) for the first time in my apple user experience i feel cheated  .
i wanted to drop cable all together and i thought apple tv combined with netfilx and sony ps3 is going to be my solution out of the handcuffs of cable tv service  .
after purchasing an apple tv and figuring out that you cannot watch cbs on it means that it's not a viable solution yet  .
the options that are available to apple tv users is horrible  .
the movie selections are pretty bad also in my opinion it's not worth it to buy an apple tv if you already have a ps3 and cable tv dvr  .
they do not provide a option to what is already out there i'm actually thinking about returning it since it serves no purpose to my current media setup .
5 hours 2 very long calls into apple care and it is finally recognizing my itunes library on my macbook pro  .
oh , the excitement begins so i turn on avatar  .
about 7 minutes in i have to pause the movie and take care of some laundry  .
i come back 10 minutes later and it appears to be froze  .
it wo not play or function what    so    ever  .
i had to literally pull the plug to restart it  .
after it boots back up it no longer can find my itunes library  .
by now apple care is closed  .
i have an appointment scheduled for them to contact me tomorrow  .
i am not entirely convinced that i am going to be keeping this  .
this is a fail on apples part .
i own the older apple tv which in my opinion is a better device    no    one should argue with me on that point especially when it comes to the hardware (the smaller size of the new one will not be a big deal)  .
its essentially a cheaper device without a hard drive but gives you the ability to tap into netflix and rent tv shows    thats just software    which the old apple tv will not be allowed to have in any future updates apparently while i like the idea of renting movies (where the cost of buying is 3x the cost of renting    you typically only need to watch a movie once)  .
i am not sure if i am into renting a tv show which is half the price of buying    in fact if you buy a season of say how i met your mother    it would end up costing less than $1  .
30 per episode    and chances are you may want to watch the same episode more than once so in other words , you have given me something i don't want and taken away something i do want  .
if i want to buy tv shows , i have to buy it on my mac and stream it to the apple tv    which is kind of back to square one again to be honest , i understand why it continues to be a hobby  .
the reason is simple   apple cannot make it anything more than that unless they negotiate better terms with content providers who are paranoid about cannibalizing their existing revenue streams with networks and dvd sales as a device i think the original apple tv is perfect actually    the key limitation is content availability , content pricing , and storage  .
storage is not about the gigabites it came with , but why i need to store anything locally at all  .
if i is allowed to purchase the content on my account and have it streamed to me whenever i wanted to , then thats a great deal  .
but i would need to have all content available at prices that are lower than the cost of dvds for movies (essentially you are cutting all the middle men) , and be able to purchase all tv shows as they air on the local networks    or give me the option to subscription deals for some content etc its a case of chicken and the egg    you cannot have a golden egg unless the chicken of the entertainment industry (studios) is willing to lay that egg and embrace this new age of digital content i just wish that the usb port on the old apple tv had some use  .
i would love to attach a hard drive to it so i don't have to worry about managing storage    i do not want my mac to have all of this content on its hard drive    i am maxed out as it is .
still cant find any good reason to buy this and i am an apple fan  .
i will probably look at the roku box or the boxee box .
i need local storage to use an apple tv  .
i hate the new design and features and so do many of the users i talked with .
