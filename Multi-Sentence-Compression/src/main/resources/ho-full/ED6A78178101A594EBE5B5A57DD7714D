the siji ( meaning 'one ' in javanese ) has a very central location and is good value at the rp 481,000 we paid for each ot two inter-connecting rooms with breakfast included .
the rooms ( nos .
505 and 506 ) are in a building abour two years old are were very clean and well-appointed , including flat screen tv with cnn and al-jazeera in english , a coffee maker , bar fridge and safe .
the beds were very comfortable ( not hard as in many indonesian hotels ) and the light was good for reading in bed .
the view was mostly the wall of the next building , but we could also see the pool next to the restaurant .
the wifi worked very well in our room .
the bathroom was very clean , with good hot water and thick towels .
our only complaint with the rooms was that the tv channels available did not match those on the list , and we could not get the australia+ channel .
there was a good choice of indonesian and western items for breakfast while facing the pool , the black coffee was really good and we enjoyed the oldies-style music in the background .
all the staff were very friendly and helpful , and the tv technician came quickly but was unable to get the australian channel we wanted .
the entrance and lobby are in a very nice heritage building with stained glass windows , and are all that 's left of whatever large building was there . . .

we were pleased that some heritage has been preserved , so that although our rooms were so modern and squeaky-clean we did not feel we were staying in just another identikit modern hotel .
there is some limited room for off-street parking in the front.
