this stayed the same even after our compliants , after the hotel guy was `` fixing '' it - altough advertised differently in the beginning , the `` hot '' shower was not able to provide hot water , but only cold one .
of course the aircondition was not working , only after our compliants magically it got power supply to work .
i dont know why but i guess their authors have been completely wrongthis hotel was the absolute worst hotel of all we had during our 1 month stay in india - it is absolutely dirty .
after we left the hotel , i had to go back to the room as i forgot something , and guess what , our bed sheets were lying on the bed ready for the next guest !
so this was not a mistake but is done to squeeze more money saving the cleaning - we took the most expensive room with aircondition .
- the water closet flushing did not work , as the water supply was not there- we gave our laundry for washing to the hotel .
during night it stopped working ( our assumption is that they again stopped the power supply to squeeze some more money ) .
the machine was manipulated in a way that it did not cool , but only the fan part was working .
and guess what , of course the hotel owner wanted us to pay the full amount in advance !
lonely planet recommends this hotel as having a lot of character as it has marble floors and mogul carpets on the walls and being clean . . .
