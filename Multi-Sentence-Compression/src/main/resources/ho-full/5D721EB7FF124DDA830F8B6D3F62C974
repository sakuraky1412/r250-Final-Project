as per title and see pictures really .
absolutely loved staying here ( room # 7 ) , facilities are good enough for the area trust me , clean and comfortable , room serviced daily , all fine and a view to die for , honest it is hard to beat this .
this would have been a 5 star but and call me a party pooper if you want , but it was totally bl***y ruined by the continuous trail of chattering people walking right outside the front window - absolutely ridiculous set up when one considers how amazing the accomodation actually is .
pathetic and basically the management need to sort it out as it ruins what i would call perfection .
again i have to be honest for the review , on one very warm night we were greeted by an infestation and i mean a lot of giant brown cockroaches on the porch and everwhere inside the villa .
it was horrible by anyones standards and they do n't even bother me .
i noticed there were cockroach traps outside our villa which means something to me , but by 'up north ' standards this was ridiculous .
nobody else on or trip had any at all ?
i have reported it to management , but maybe best avoid villa 7 for a while i reckon .
or at least ask what they 've done about it eh ?
bar that the dolphin experience is also sadly now mediocre compared to its former days , like most good things ruined by rules . . .
