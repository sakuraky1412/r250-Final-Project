we found this hotel on expedia for less that 500 baht per night for a twin room for myself and my daughter .
its not 5 star but for the price it is fabulous .
there is a lovely clean pool with padded sunbeds , towels and a small gym .
the restaurant is cheap and the buffet breakfast looks better than some 4 star hotels i have been to with a hot option of eggs , sausage , bacon , etc and a buffet which has fresh fruit , salad , fresh juices teas and coffee and toast for 80 baht this is unbeatable .
we got upgraded to room 408 and are here for 6 nights , we leave this friday .
wifi free and good and places to lock your bicycles .
the room is cleaned daily , with clean towels , a small table and chairs is brilliant as we like to buy food and bring back , a large fridge and a kettle and tea and coffee , there is also a safe in the room .
for 450 baht per night for the two of us no one has the right to complain this is absolute bliss , yes the pillows and beds are slightly hard and they could do with duvet covers instead of blankets but its perfect for the price .
a/c very good , quiet and cold .
its close to maya mall 10 min walk and the mountain where we cycle every day , there is another mall within 5 minutes walk where . . .
