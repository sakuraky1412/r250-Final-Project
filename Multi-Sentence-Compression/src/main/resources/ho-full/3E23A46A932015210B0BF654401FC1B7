this is hardly a resort - the swimming pool is empty and with no other resort facilities that we could see - but the hotel is on the beach , where the sand is grey from the dark rock and littered .
unlike the rest the places we visited in our 20 day november myanmar trip ( mandalay , bagan , yangon , golden rock , hpa-an ) , the weather here was pleasantly mild - much cooler than hpa-an , and surprisingly less humid compared with yangon much further south .
it was very pleasant to sit outside to eat dinner and there were no mosquitoes .
at the in-house restaurant we enjoyed fish curry and fried vegetable curry both rakine style .
our junior suite was clean and came with a sitting room as well as the bedroom , each with an air con which we left on in the sitting room only , blowing sufficient cool air into the bedroom ; as well as monogrammed sheets and towels .
it was very quiet at night .
water pressure was low but the water is hot , 10 minutes after turning on the heater .
the television has bbc news .
wifi did n't work in the evening and we needed our caps with built-in led lights to read in bed as there is little room lighting .
wifi was available at breakfast for with limited email access only .
breakfast food : bananas , sliced watermelon and pawpaw ; orange and watermelon juice ; hot ( well tepid ) local food , pancakes and eggs as well as . . .
