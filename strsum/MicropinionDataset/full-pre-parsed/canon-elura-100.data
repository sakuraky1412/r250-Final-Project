all around excellent product and a joy to use .

i want to write this review to squelch the complaints about motor noise interfering with sound  .

when i first began my investigation , of which digital video to purchase , i is skeptical due to the user reviews about the motor noise interfering with the sound recording  .

i is allowed to test the camera before purchase and while the motor noise is noticeable it did not seem that it would interfere with audio  .

i decided to purchase the camera  .

after purchasing the camera , recording and playing back on the camera as well as on the t  .

the motor noise is not evident to my ears or anyone else that watches/listens  .

my opinion is this is a perfect camera for my use taping my sons football basketball games and my daughters gymnastics hockey games and indoor family events  .

indoor lighting has produced more than acceptable video for us and taping on sunny days produces perfectly rich looking video  .

my hats off to canon  .

stop  .

are you considering to purchase a camcorder that records to dvd or harddrive  .

well unless your watching the video unedited on a 13inch tv then mini dv is the way to go  .

right off the bat , i did consider the issue with motor noise before purchasing it  .

yes its bad but any basic audio cleaner will do wonders  .

the first thing that stuck in my mind is the small size  .

it is so small you could fit it in your jean pocket  .

to many great things to say .

would replace this one with sameone if need arose  .

low light not too good but does ok in a pinch  .

lack of supporting video software a minus  .

expensive to buy  .

also hard to find the one that is ease to use  .

had to buy a firewire pci card so i could capture video  .

still from sd card download ok with supllied usb cable  .

best still photo i have ever taken is with this camera on a 1 gb sd card using telephot lens .

the camera has beet great so far  .

i have owned it for several months and it works great  .

i also use it as an analogue to digital video converter , to transfer old vcr tapes to my pc and then to dvd  .

i intended to by this item for myself , but since it is so easy to use and the build quality is so great , my wife decided that she would use it all the time  .

all    in    all it is a great deal  .

awesome video recording quality and easy to use .

i would really recommend this camera , especially if you want a camera with good video under $400 .

after much research , i bought this camera for $306  .

havent had a new video camera for over 10 years and is surprised at how much smaller they have become  .

found it a pleasant surprise and came with so many features  .

and the price is right  .

i found the wide screen function great  .

the zoom focused great except when going past the optical zoom (20x) into the digital range (up to 800x)  .

in my opinion anything past 20    25x zoom would be to shaky anyway  .

battery is super small and lasts a long time  .

the buttons were well placed , however , if my hands were any larger , i would have difficulty since the camera is so small but the trade off is worth it i have read reviews about the motor noise concerns , i have not noticed this at all so maybe it might be a defect in some cameras performs best when out door shooting  .

in door shooting can be a little dark but still acceptable overall the elura 100 is priced right and worth the money .

for the price this cam is the best (beter than the sony's hc26/46 for sure)  .

it is very compact , the battery life is excellent ( i got 160 mins on single charge with lcd use at lower brightness and frequent power ups)  .

the image quality under normal light is crisp  .

very good color preproduction and the image stabilliztion works decent  .

1/5 ccd (others are usually 1/6 )  .

true widescreen cons   the low light videos are slightly grainy (but for the price you cant expect more) the led lights are not enough for anything further than 2 ft .

this camcorder is great looked around for sometime c    net helped make my decision , i have large hands and i love this camcorder , many features that i will use  .

i got this camcorder the first week of july , just in time for my cruise vacation , and i must say that this palm sized little champion of a camcorder did a fabulous job of captureing my vacation memories  .

the 20x optical zoom is wonderful for zooming in on otherwise hard to get shots  .

the anti    shake feature is also a big help  .

in short i did my homework and i must agree with cnet , this is a wonderful budget priced camcorder with expensive camcorder results  .

read the manual  .

and get yourself adobe premiere elements  .

to do your videos with and you will have hollywood type videos , enjoy .

overall , i am very satisfied with the elura 100 and the camcorder is actually better than what i expected  .

battery life is amazing , although internal batteries are not supposed to last long  .

quality of the videos are great for the price , and the pictures are pretty sharp  .

also , many people complain about motor noise but to me , it was not much of a problem handling is a bit of a struggle , however , as the camcorder is small and my hands are rather large .

i researched like most people do for quite some time and decided on this model as the camcorder that offered all the great features available , good performance of actual recording and is most affordable  .

i ended up purchasing from an online store for $314  .

00 including shipping and tax compared to $409  .

00 at my local electronics store i've been playing around with the camera for a few days now and i still have much to learn about it though nothing seems too overwhelming  .

the manual is very clear and simple  .

you can record in widescreen or regular depending on what type of tv you have at home  .

you can take a still photo while you are recording video without any interruption to the video  .

you can also go back through the playback of one of your videos and record a still image later  .

included is the video cable so you can connect and watch your videos on the tv , then sit back on your couch and control the camera w/the wireless remote  .

probably the best feature is being able to upload to your pc w/the included usb so you can burn your movies to dvd  .

(assuming you have a dvd burner on your pc  .

if not you can also burn using a dvd burner and your tv  .

for recording in different light situations there are 9 different modes that all help w/focus and clarity  .

specially like night mode that helps a lot in low light situations  .

makes recording w/as little as a reading lamp possible if needed  .

there's also a fireworks mode that i plan on using on my upcoming trip to disney during independence weekend  .

also has 9 different ways to fade in and out of recording along w/9 different special effects for recording such as black white and sepia  .

navigating back and forth between different modes is very easy as there is not too much bunched up in the menu  .

also , navigating is mostly w/the joy stick that is really cool and makes it easy to work your way around  .

(sony and their touch lcd screens sound cool but seemed more difficult and harmful to the screen  .

waiters sometimes struggle entering your order onto a 20inch screen  .

your camcorder screen is 2  .

7 inches people  .

color viewfinder helps for recording in extra bright situations where the lcd screen might not look so well , though this lcd screen out performs the color , brightness and clarity of many other similar camcorders  .

the 20x zoom is more than enough to zoom to objects more than a city block away  .

obviously you might not need to do that very often but just imagine how well it can perform for objects within close/average range  .

the batter is hidden inside where the lcd screen opens from to keep it from getting bulkier on the outside  .

audio has two options , regular and extra sensitive  .

both are good depending on the situation  .

lcd light is very bright to look at but it does help a bit in low light situations  .

i have yet to see a camera w/an excellent light on this type of camera  .

you'll have to go back to the old vhs cameras for a good light  .

if needed , there are mounts available for sale on the net to add an extra light for about $20 though they dont look very attractive in terms of appearance  .

all of the jacks for charging , viewing , cards and batteries are all hidden or blend in to keep it looking sleek inside and out  .

go out to your local store and pick up and handle all the cameras available  .

many , specially those by samsung and jvc seem to be made of cheap plastic  .

the canon is very solid and sturdy that makes you feel like you have a higher end camcorder  .

which in terms of what you get , you practically do have a higher end camcorder  .

there is also a cover that slides over the lens to protect it now the negatives  .

the viewfinder , though it is in color which is good , does not have any kind of extension or comfort piece for your eye socket  .

you literally place the camera on your face  .

for some this might actually be a positive though so it's up to you  .

the strap is not as big or attractive as the sony strap  .

this is my wife's only complaint  .

she didnt care so much about the specs as she did about how it looked  .

i do agree w/her though that it could probably be a little bigger  .

i found it easier to not use the strap and instead put my hand over the strap in order to get a good grip angle on the zoom lever  .

which means the zoom lever may be the only piece that could benefit from being moved or enlarged a bit  .

specially for folks w/bigger hands or long fingers  .

still this is not enough of a problem for me to even complain about it  .

all of the other features plus the ability to find it just over $300 is more than i can ask for .

i'm new to the digital camcorder world , but have wanted one for a long time  .

my wife and i went to los cabos , mexico and decided it is the right time to purchase one  .

we decided on this model after seeing consumer reports' ratings of the elura 85 and 90  .

both were highly rated and the 100 is no different in my opinion out of the box , the camcorder is easy to use  .

i especially liked the precise zoom and autofocus functionality  .

i is also very impressed with the lcd image quality  .

the light weight and compact design made for a comfortable fit in my hand the image quality of the video is excellent  .

some sites claim it's hr or high resolution and it may well be , but i didn't notice too much of a difference between this and other non    hr cameras , although they were more expensive in general  .

i love the true widescreen lcd display , and it translated perfectly to our widescreen tv at home  .

i just recently discovered the effects built into the camera's software  .

some of them are kind of cheesy , but would probably be really cool to see if you're kid the controls are very easy to use once you get the hang of them  .

on    screen graphics make them easy to navigate and after about an hour of use i felt comfortable with them the only gripes i have with the camera are    .

the noise from the tape mechanism  .

during recording of quiet footage , you can hear the buzz of the tape , but it's only noticable during very low    noise recording    image stability is less than stellar  .

although good , the image stability control is not always up to snuff  .

i'm basing this on use during activities , though  .

for example , we did an atv excersion and i is able to record while riding  .

i don't think any camera could have recorded this without shakiness but with this camera it is almost unwatchable  .

again , not having a lot of experience with these things i don't have anything on which to compare it  .

but even during casual strolls along the resort we were staying it seems to bounce around a little  .

holding it with two hands helped a lot , so it may be just that my hand shakes too much or that i am jarring my arm downward when i walk  .

not a major issue for me    the included spotlight , while great for low    light environments , leaves a bluish tint on anything being recorded  .

this is a luxury anyway , since many cameras don't seem to have a light included on them  .

still , the picture quality takes a hit from this light but you're not expecting great quality during low    light recording anyway    a big grip for me is that there's only a usb cable included    no firewire  .

i could be wrong but i believe the only way to tranfer video directly from the camera to a computer is via a firewire connection and if this is the case it should have been included with the camera  .

i had to go out a buy a firewire card with the cable in order to transfer video to my pc , and it works nicely this is a great camera , and beginners will definitely appreciate its inuitive controls  .

i recommend this camera for anyone wanting a low    cost , full    featured camcorder who does not mind a little background noise during certain recording environments .

i've used this camcorder for a few days now and have to say i am utterly impressed    .

it records fantastic images under bright light    even in dim conditions (hardly any daylight/just a few lamps) it records excellent images    it is very small and portable  .

any smaller and it just wouldn't be usable  .

the buttons are well laid out and easy to use for my wife with small/average size hands and me with my bigger hands  .

do note though that the camera is very small and sometimes you will have a hrad time shooting steady video , if holding it with only one hand  .

i usually just use my other hand to steady it holding the lcd screen    some users complain that it feels cheaply built or even flimsy  .

i don't share that opinion at all  .

it's just that it is made of plastic and light weight    very good battery life , even when using the lcd screen all the time  .

the little viewfinder doesn't extend and is almost unusable  .

they could have honestly skipped it and just made the camcorder another $50 cheaper    the lens cover is built in , so no chance of it going awol ever again  .

records in true widescreen (can be switched to 4  3 in a heartbeat though)  .

most camcorders in this price range will just chop your 4 ; 3 image and make it look like 16  9  .

so although the elura 100 doesn't record in hd (which at this time costs another $1k) it is somewhat future    proof to watch your home video on your next tv purchase (most likely a hdtv) and make full use of all it's real estate    features analog    to    digital passthrough  .

while most camcorders in this price class skip that feature , the e100 allows you to convert your old analog videos to digital format and enjoy them for years/decades to come    some people complain of motor or a clicking noise , i have not noticed either  .

makes me think canon had some birthing problems with the first run of these i've done a lot of comparing , trying to decide between 3ccd , hd and so forth  .

the elura 100 in my opinion allows me to shoot great video now at a very economical price (#329 delivered) and i wo not feel bad when i upgrade to the next generation hd camcorder in a few years .

i purchased one elura 100 from dell  .

com when it went on sale $325 ; the design is very compact , with battery under the lcd , open /eject button on the top , overall it is a smart design  .

on the performance , the still picture quality is startling good , at 1  .

33m it close to a digital camera picture ; sd card feature is a great addition , i recorded 48 minutes out of 512mb sandisk sd mini card  .

video is just ok for viewing on computer  .

it blurs when changes to full screen  .

but 100% original size looks very nice  .

of course , if u use mini dv tape , then video palyback on tv is going to be fabulous  .

the one feature makes this camcorder stands out to others is two video lights for low light or dak condition , very bright light by the side of lens  .

battery life is 150m , compare to 90m of canon zr600  .

the only con is camcorder is thick that the back of my hands hurts by holding 5 minutes  .

i highly recommend this camcorder , same price as zr 700 , and $50 more than zr600 , it worthes every penny and this camcorder is much better than zr700 or zr600 , i bought the zr600 and now have to ebay it .

i've brought this little camera all over the world with me and it has never failed (in regard to the work around error it still functions great) i has been dropped off tables splashed liquid on it and just overall used to the max  .

it still work's great and shoots like brand new , i would buy another if i had lost this one .

i got it at staples in january 2007 , before they changed their 110% pricematch policy in september  .

it cost me about $200  .

i use sony tapes , which have been fine  .

like a tape player , you can ruin these tapes if over used so download to dvd if you can  .

i just got a sony vrd    mc3 to make mine , because i just cannot use an apple  .

i took a simple fly    on    the    wall approach to my first recording  .

it is all indoors , and 97% is great  .

why  .

we had ample lamps and open windows for light  .

when i didn't catch the light , the pictures got muddy  .

sound in a crowded room is picked up from most all angles if using no separately held mic  .

but , unless done in a quiet small room , no motor noise  .

my next project is an outdoor b    day/reunion party at a park  .

the colors were vibrant , and i got smart at how to adjust my camera to catch the light under a roof  .

99% is great  .

little editing will need done on that one  .

i am concerned over the cheaply made rubber covers for plugins  .

battery is spendy if you want to replace it or have a spare which is nice  .

have not used photo yet , but i got an sd card that needs no reader , and it fit in fine  .

i is told that canon will put out a newer version of this in a year or so  .

maybe we should email them our imput as to what we do not want to lose what we really need to have added  .

i really like this vidcam  .

it is my first one i have owned but i am very happy with it  .

it does not do the best in low lighting but any camara needs good light  .

i have not noticed any buzzing that i saw in other reviews .

i have read ratings and reviews on this camcorder from a dozen different sources  .

camcorder of the year , wonderful , the best , nothing comes close to the performance for the price , superb picture and so on strangely , canon seems at the top of their game in terms of engineering and product development , and at the bottom of their game in marketing and sales  .

it's no longer available , i've checked bizrate , pricescan , ecost , buy  .

com , gobs of places , not available , discontinued  .

it's the most popular model on cnet , and frequently given the nod over other similar canon models like the z700 , z800 , z850 and so on , and not available now strangely , canon seems to be exhibiting a lot of this strange , self    destructive behavior these days  .

their printers are undergoing the same puzzling trends  .

the i560 and pixma ip3000 were so good , and obtained nearly a cult following for price , value and reliability  .

even though these printers used to sell new for as little as $65 , they can now be found on ebay and amazon , when you can find them , even slightly used , selling for nearly $200 , purchased by customers that are desparate to try to still find them  .

meanwhile , go into staples , office max , best buy and other stores , and you may not even be able to find a canon printer on the store shelf , or if you do , you can observe many customers that are frustrated or confused by the endless model swaps and inability to find a model that they've read about or with which they are familiar  .

why does canon seem so intent on cannibalizing themselves  .

i consider myself technically saavy , but i wanted a camera that i could take out of the box and pretty much start using quickly without a lot of technical frustrations  .

i also do not need a camera loaded with features that i will never use  .

i will use this camera primarily to take family videos and transfer the footage the computer to edit and burn to dvd or post to a website  .

this camera has satisfied all of my requirements    user    friendly interface , great price , great quality and compatible with macs  .

if you are looking for an easy    to    use camera for just shooting simple videos , i highly recommend this one .

i've had a number of camcorders over the years (vhs    c , svcs    c , hi8 , minidv)  .

the last i had is a canon zr50 , which has served me well for the past few years , but needs replacing because it's chewing up tapes (a problem with older zr models and gl2 , according to google)  .

after extensive research , i settled on the elura 100 as a replacement  .

the motor noise issue is the one consistent complaint i heard about this camera  .

i did a side by side comparison of the elura with my old zr50 , which definitely has a motor noise problem , to evaluate the issue the zr50 produces a high    pitched whine throughout quiet scenes  .

by contrast , the noise picked up from the elura is a lower tone that sounds like the camera is upping the gain to 'look for sound'  .

i found that if there is any significant sound in the room , then the gain is lowered and the motor noise all    but disappears  .

this is not the case with the zr50    the high    pitched whine is constantly there unless drained out by other noise  .

so through editing of the final video , the volume of the 'silent' scenes can be reduced to minimize elura's motor noise  .

all in all , the elura's noise is an improvement over the zr50 using an external microphone in both cases is interesting  .

on the zr50 , the external mic picks up the high    pitched whine of the zr50  .

with the elura , it picks up nothing    the sound is almost totally silent  .

this brings up the one flaw of the elura    no shoe  .

this is not a show stopper , since for $10 you can pick up a bracket that screws into the tripod thread  .

a little ungainly for such a small camera , but for concerts or suchlike , that's going to be my solution .

one thing i like about this camcorder is it's small , lightweight , great daytime color and very high quality sound  .

first off the images ; when taking this on a sunny day , your color will be excellent  .

you get great detail as well as you take still images the microphone is very sensitive , it picks up things i didn't even hear at first , until playback you pick up things that you just noticed  .

dogs barking , someone talking , music  .

as far as music , i taped someone playing and singing with a guitar , and it picked up some really great sound from the artist as far as peoples complaints for motor sounds , i'm mostly either editing the soundtrack , or recording events and stuff  .

so it does not really pick up the motor sounds at all  .

if you're into recording empty rooms with nothing happening , then maybe do some further review on the sound , for some people complain about it i love the wide screen , it's true 16  9 and it captures a lot  .

i filmed a day on the beach with my boi and his dog in widescreen , and it picked up a lot of stuff in one shot it only gets me sometimes is the low light performance  .

you do get some grain in normal lighting settings , and if you slow the shutter speed , you'll get more light in evidentaly but play back makes images look a lil ghostly to me when i move around (but that's just me) over all i'm very satisfied , i'm also using this camera to do some special effects , green screen and so forth with some extra lighting which will be required i recommend this for those who are just starting , wanting a family and travel type camcorder and some regular shooting .

here is a list of the motion picture cams i've owned since 1968   kodak brownie 8mm ,  .

chinon super8 sound , sanyo vm    d6 8mm video and now the elura 100  .

(i'm not counting the aiptek for obvious reasons)  .

i have owned 10 times as many still cameras in the same time period the point is , i'm a lousy videographer so in looking for a camcorder , i needed one that i could justify the cost of yet still not come up short in the i wish i could department  .

the elura 100 fits all of that good color , sound and the picture quality is great too  .

but what makes it a real camera is the ability to accept filters , lenses and an external mic  .

it also will accept an external av input making transfer of my old 8mm tapes or even copying from one dv to another because it will shoot in true 16  9 , i am convinced that is going to be my usual mode as we move further into the new century , 4  3 will become an artsy or retro format if it has not already it can carry an sd card and will take 1mp stills (not that great but possibly good for planning later scenes) and video in qvga now , in relation to that , one negative i noted is that some of the used canons i saw on ebay had tape loading/transport problems  .

but i'm sure that is common to any camera with moving parts as others have mentioned , the controls are a bit tiny and touchy and i have to remember to look for sub    menus for some adjustments i'm used to manual adjustments on still cameras to be accessable right away so it's just me the elura 100 is quite compatable with my editing software ulead video studio 10 and the best recommendation on that is to buy a firewire cable for it right away aside from that , the worse problem i've had  .

is holding on to the thing  .

i'd love to find a pistol grip like the ones on the demo cameras at my local costco (not where i got this cam btw)  .

where did we ever get the idea that one hand is sufficent for a camcorder  .

conclusion  good quality , flexibility and price  .

it's a canon so i'm thinking it'll hold up for a while  .

my first digital still is a canon and survived everything except 3rd row @ a gallagher show keep this one in mind and maybe get it on    line from a place you trust as store retail is a bit pricey in relation .

i thought i would have to spend over $1 , 000 to get video quality this good  .

very close to television broadcast  .

some people complain about motor noise   i have'nt heard any yet  .

i is wondering if a $315 camcorder would be good enough for me as i am a perfectionist ; but i plan on keeping this one  .

you wo not regret the elura 100  .

buy it today  .

plan on spending another $100 on assessories .

this camera is easy to use , very functional ,  .

has many features  .

the menu    joystick is 'user friendly'  .

the playback quality of the video and sound is amazing  .

not easy to use if you have large hands  .

recommend attaching a neck strap to the wrist strap for walking around  .

the built    in lens cover is handy  .

the still    camera is also easy to use , but playback quality is low , this is only 1  .

3m pixels  .

would not recommend as primary digital camera  .

must buy the firewire cable for $25  .

battery life is very good considering the size  .

the plastic  .

covers for the plugins are flimsy  .

i detected no motor noise as many reviews mention  .

you'll be happy with this camera if you pay less than $350  .

but , dont purchase from new connections mail order online  .

they did a bait    switch on an accessory kit and do not respond to contacts .

i spent hours reviewing video cameras prior to purchasing my elura 100  .

my main goal is to find an affordable camera that delivered good quality , low light (in door) performance  .

my secondary goal is finding good battery life  .

this unit's standard battery has been compared to extended life batteries of other units , and has not run out on me yet when i've been filming so far my wife and i have been very pleased  .

i do think the unit is a bit difficult to handle  .

that is , once you have the unit strapped to your hand it can be tricky to access functions .

required a small and inexpensive (in case of breakage) video cam for downhill skiing  .

fits the bill perfectly  .

also wanted all of the outputs to attach a helmet cam    one of the few in this range to offer this option  .

prefer it to sony due to the sony touch screen controls    a dubious touch in the out of doors where hands are not always clean  .

overall    excellent for the money .

so i is looking for a cheap camcorder and i read the reviews of the elura 100  .

it's great camera though i overpaid at fry's $399  .

this is my 2nd camcorder i've owned (the previous a vintage panasonic vhs    c from 1989       one of the first vhs    c camcorders from panasonic       a big beast ; but durable    they built that thing like a tank       i paid $1000 for that thing back then       err my dad did) i would say that the elura 100 provides excellent performance outdoors and has many features for this price  .

the colors are accurate , and sharp outside  .

just stick it on easy and you are all set  .

there's excellent saturation too ; nothing is washed out like some cameras and you don't need any polarizing filter    it is tested in southern california sunshine       but get a clear uv haze filter to protect the lens (27mm) for indoors , to get the most optimum results you should adjust the white balance and exposure  .

what i do is lie to the camera and put the exposure on snow which seems to boost the gain indoors and opens the aperture all the way    i don't know exactly why    but if you mess with the exposure settings you can increase the aperture more indoors  .

also , with the white balance , for indoors i usually set it to outdoor if there's natural light coming through the window ; or tungsten mode which has a warmer feel for the video footage the camera's exposure sensor gets a little confused if there's extreme bright light coming in and will close down the aperture a lot  .

you just gotta over    ride with manual aperture usually i normally rent a vx    2100 from sony for wedding production videos       so i'm very familiar with video cameras       the vx    2100 is the best benchmark to use ; and that camera has amazing low    light performance without hardly any perceivable noise  .

you can definitely see what a tiny 1/5 ccd does to the performance but nontheless , this is a sub $400 camera and it's a bang for the buck if you do most of your shooting outside with your family/friends/drinking buddies , etc  .

on the beach , parks , etc  .

this camera wo not dissapoint  .

if you do a  majority  of shooting indoors at night (there are some people who do this  .

when they have parties)       you need to seriously look at cameras with a much bigger sensor       like 1/3 to get the best performance       the elura 100 is only so    so  .

alternatively , you can purchase some bright lights and bounce them to make up for the small ccd of the elura 100 if you want to shoot indoors at night .

after owning a sony dcr    hc21 and being less than happy , i did alot of research before buying this one the elura 100 is a great choice  .

slightly above entry level  .

no regrets on this one  .

it's been a very long time since i've used a camcorder  .

so this is very difficult to rate  .

i've got to force myself to remember that this is an economically priced entry level camera  .

keeping this in mind , i will rate this camera higher than i would if i paid more for it  .

i paid $379 at bb for this guy  .

i was not going to buy any camcorder that didn't have a remote  .

when i shopped for camcorders that had remotes , i always ended up in the $600 range  .

then i found this guy and it made me happy because it seemed to be exactly what i needed and much less expensive i do like this camera  .

i did have to purchase a fire wire cable and those guys aren't cheap  .

the fire wire cable is needed to download videos to a computer i really thought that i couldn't do without a 20x or higher optical zoom  .

i excluded a lot of camcorders just because they only had a 10x optical zoom or less  .

after using this camera for 3 weeks , i've learned that i could have settled for less optical zoom  .

i find that i rarely if ever want to use any zoom the first time i downloaded videos to my computer , windows xp asked me if i wanted to use windows movie maker  .

i chose yes and it seems to be a very decent program to use  .

windows movie maker does many of the things i need to do  .

at first i let movie maker choose the bit rate that it thought is best  .

then i learned that if i wanted the actual recording quality that the camera had produced i would need to choose the 25 mb/sec rate  .

but at that rate the files are enormous  .

so my plan is to record everything , then preview using movie maker , find my favorite few seconds or minutes of video and capture them at the highest rate possible  .

after all , most of what i shoot is ultra    boring as far as shooting still photos , i do not really plan on using that feature  .

that is what i have a digital camera for  .

nothing beats a digital camera for stunning digital photos  .

every day , i pack my digital camera and my new canon camcorder in my briefcase  .

it's a good combination if i had paid $600 for this camcorder i would give it a lower rating , but for this price range , i will rate it higher it's got a pretty good bang for the buck factor going for it cheers ,  .

dave  .

this is one nice little camera the overall picture quality is quite  .

good  .

i did notice purple fringing  .

around some objects in bright scenes  .

but no big deal  .

i have been using it  .

outside only , havn't tried using it  .

inside just yet the size is great  .

i can slip this  .

into my coat pocket without much problem the controls are pretty well placed  .

and easy to learn  .

features such as  .

analog    to    digital conversion is good  .

to have  .

i'll probably use it some days  .

to convert old tapes this camera has decent zoom (20x)  .

i was  .

considering this and the zr700 which is  .

about the same price  .

went with the  .

elura 100 due to better pic quality  .

from a review i read the ability to capture to sd card is nice  .

to have , although , serious picture takers  .

should get a real camera instead  .

1mp  .

just does not cut it i like the true widescreen feature  .

this  .

is great for the newer tv sets  .

battery  .

life is decent  .

probably a good idea to  .

get an extra bp    208 (i think) for around  .

$45 this little camcorder is an excellent  .

value for the money (paid $309 for it) .

i bought this camcorder based on many reviews and hours of research  .

i finally found one at our local best buy as a clearance item  .

daytime video is great with robust color definition  .

the problem arose when i tried to shoot indoors  .

the video is really dark as compared to 2 older sony camcorders used for testing  .

another small problem is noticed with the elura's auto focus  .

it is slower to focus would occasionally hunt more so than the other 2 sonys  .

if you plan on shooting only in bright light then this camera would be a good choice in this price range but if you are like me need to shoot indoors there are better choices  .

i really wanted to like this camcorder but unfortunately i need to shoot many of my children's milestones indoors  .

i could not rely on this camcorder for those once in a lifetime moments .

i would keep this camera , except for the less than stellar performance in low light conditions and the terribly annoying motor whine which pervades the audio recording  .

if you are at all sensitive to the sound quality , beware  .

steer clear if audio matters to you  .

the motor causes a whining sound that is extremely audible in recordings taken with little background noise  .

i'm surprised that c    net's review didn't mention that  .

did thay make a recording with it  .

if audio does not matter to you then go for it  .

it had a pretty decent picture .

the video quality on this camera is great but all that is ruined by a very very loud tape drive  .

the sound coming from the minidv tape drive is so loud that it is picked up by both the built    in microphone and an external microphone placed a good 5    6 inches from the unit  .

the distortion is so bad i returned the camera  .

canon needs to address this issue as i have been reading about this a lot lately  .

let the buyer beware with this camera .

i cannot tell you how disappointed i am with the motor noise problem which afflicts this camera  .

i bought it for a superb price ($306) from amazon  .

com , along with a sony hdr    hc3 ($1 , 150) high    definition camcorder  .

my intent is to compare the cameras side    by    side in identical shooting situations , to see how they compared with each other both cameras were put through their paces in several hours of both indoor and outdoor recording  .

the outdoor footage included sunny and cloudy days , high noon and twilight , and recordings of my grandchildren sledding after a 15    inch snowfall  .

the elura 100 astounded me with the quality of its video in all of these situations  .

in some footage it is actually superior to the high    definition sony on playback (though i did not use an hdmi cable to play the sony footage back through my high    definition tv)  .

now for the disappointing news  .

with a houseful of family (four generations' worth) at thanksgiving , i demonstrated both cameras' output for my relatives and everybody is impressed with both cameras' video performance  .

however , everybody in the room (18 people , literally) asked what the high    pitched whine is when i played the elura 100 through my tv  .

most likened it to the sound of a machine shop operating at full bore (though much quieter , obviously)  .

the whine is very audible (and very annoying) in all footage , even recordings of people's conversations  .

the unanimous verdict of my relatives is that none of them would even consider keeping a camera which tainted its video recordings with such an obnoxious sound thinking (and hoping) that the noise is somehow being communicated by the camera itself during the playback function , i played the canon    recorded tape on tv using the sony hdr    hc3 as the playback engine , but the same intolerable whine came through the tv loud and clear i also played the tape of the same activities which is recorded with the sony videocam  .

the sony    recorded tape is played through my tv with both the sony videocam and the elura 100 as the playback machine  .

the result  .

no background whine , hum or other noise whatsoever  .

the problem therefore lies in the recording mechanism/process of the elura 100 itself alas  .

i've fallen in love with the size , weight , user    friendliness , features and video output of the canon elura 100 , but even if the camera cost nothing , i cannot justify or overlook the annoying sound which would hereafter accompany priceless recordings of the most important people in my life (if i were to continue to use the elura 100)  .

since others have commented about the same problem , i'm not optimistic that an exchange for another elura 100 will solve the problem  .

so , the elura 100 is going back to amazon  .

com but for the deal    killing whine in my recordings , i would rate this camera a 10 .

i read all the reviews  .

kept reading about camera noise , so i had to check out for myself  .

my cousin has this camera , and he permitted me to use it at several of my childrens events  .

initially , i had no problems  .

at a birthday party and a karate tournament , it performed flawlessly  .

however , when i tried to tape my daughters piano recital , or coax a few words out of a friends baby , the motor noise is very blatant  .

in situations where there is alot of noise to drown out the motor , such as parties and sporting events , its fine  .

but if you do an interview , or if you tape a piano recital or such where there is not much other background noise , the motor will be heard clearly  .

i decided to move on to another camera .

i bought this camera using the recommendations from cnet  .

i is very disappointed because of the motor noise  .

it is so loud that it got in to the recording  .

this noise is very distinct  .

i would surely recommend a sony dcr hc36/dcr hc46 instead of this one  .

the performance of my camera started out great , but then continuously deteriorated to the point where i can barely use it any more , all due to the infamous remove the casette error message that constantly occurs  .

i've done all the removing the battery , and going from vcr to record , then twirling around the room three times , yada , yada , but it's just too much work for such an unreliable result and product i see there are countless others with this problem , mostly the 50 and 80 models  .

any other 100 owners have this problem  .

it's obviously a design defect that canon is well aware of , yet is doing nothing about  .

i cannot tell you all the frustration and grief this has caused if i could , i'd just like my money back , no class action suit or anything like that  .

but if pushed , i have no choice but to fight for what's right  .

it's a shame canon would put out a product like this , knowing full well they have a design problem , especially when they carry it over from one model to the next does anyone have any advice or suggestions on how to get a refund  .

i have to say that this camera is about 10 years behind , it has a 0  .

88 megapixel ccd , which means my 10 year old panasonic digital camera at 1mp had a better resolution  .

although it did fairly well (for the resolution ) in low light , simply it is a waste of time filming anything since i would not be able to sit and watch it on anything except the 2 lcd screen .
