- if you want some nice proper massages , any of the roads have lovely foot massages for only a few hundred bht , so that was nice to do at the end of a days walking .
- we used the gym too which had a couple of running machines and a cross trainer that i couldnt get to work !
wander down a mini red-light district ) , there is a road that has a number of bars and girls and is fun just to walk through or have a drink at to watch the characters go by !
- it can be noisy at times because of the main road outside , but as the rooms are right at the top of the hotel , you didnt really notice it that much - maybe only at rush hour really .
we ate at one just across the road ( cant remember the exact name but it had the word 'kitchen ' in the title ) and that was delicious with generous portions .
- breakfast had lots of choices and the egg station was very good too .
its out of the hotel and turn right , walk to the main road and turn right again and about 50-100 yards on the right hand side is a street of bars etc .
- lovely rooftop pool and bar , especially great for looking at the views across bangkok and also watching the sunset .
pros : - great location , right on sumhumvit road and by both a syktrain ( bts ) and a metro station .
- the food and drink prices in the hotel are very expensive and everything has tax added onto the prices .
