many many pros the touch screen really works , intutive , easy to use menu , and through itunes it got better and better over time without having to move away from your pc / mac the fact that every other manufacturer since the release of the iphone has been trying to copy it proves to me that it really is ahead of its time it has set new standards for the user , the industry to me  .
it's the way of things to come in many many levels .
this is the best phone i have ever had  .
i love all of the app upgrade options and the fact that i now have my music and phone in one device  .
great 3g reception here in texas .
great phone , the only thing that let it down    the price point when it first cam out  .
this is the greatest phone of all time  .
there is nothing wrong with it as long as you are carful with it and have a data plan  .
cheaper than a blackberry and much much better  .
buy this phone  .
the 3gs version is much faster and worth it  .
i highly recommend this phone  .
saved my life in nyc and could make you have a great time wherever city you are in .
great phone  .
it is a great product , but it is a computer so it does crash sometimes    and that is a strange thing  )  .
mutimedia msg get with the times new technology that does not have a basic function  .
it is a great phone if you live in an area where at t coverage is strong , however if you do not live in one of these areas , then i would not recommend you get any at t phone , period  .
but the iphone itself is really a great phone and is the best phone i have ever had , bar none  .

one of the best items i bought this year  .
i was not sure if an upgrade is worth it , but the newer model really makes email much less painful  .
the best part of the iphone is the apps store    there really is an app for everything  .
i'm a huge gamer , and movie tv watcher  .
i travel a lot , and have access to instant entertainment without having to carry an ipod too  .
the movies look great on it .
the best phone in the world  .
if all i wanted is a phone i would get something else , but adding the value of the iphone to the at t service still makes the hands down winner  .
i converted everything from windows to apple after seeing what apple is able to do with software/hardware integration for the benefit of the user  .
my money is on apple for the foreseeable future for me  .
i have had two blackberry's and , while nice products , the typing difference is the only area where i would rate them superior and that is not a deal breaker when all of the other iphone features are added in to the decision .
i had the opportunity of owning a blackberry bold and switched back to this phone  .
the main reason is that if you have a mac this phone sync flawlessly which is expected  .
blackberry's really don't play nice with mac os and far as syncing contacts , calenders etc  .
also because it's a product of apple , you can just pick up and use the product without having to look at any instruction manuals  .
ease of use baby also with 3  .
0 update coming the iphone is going to get a lot of things that it has been knocked for not having overall you have to give credit where credit is due and this is a great phone  .
i do not think that it's comparable to blackberry bold and it's hands down better than the storm .
i just bought a htc touch pro as my first smartphone in january as i've been with sprint forever  .
i found it very difficult to use and i didn't like it at all  .
i finally broke down and decided i wanted to get an iphone about 1 month ago and switched to at t  .
i had to eat the $200 charge from sprint for breaking my contract and i just gave away the htc touch pro to a family member what a great decision  .
i love the iphone  .
it works so damn well it's unbelievable  .
there are some things apple should add to it , but overall i'm ecstatic about this phone  .
i'm old enough to remember when i is in college and there is a group of people who loved their apple computers and a group of people who loved their dos machines and would scoff at apple users as being simpletans who weren't smart enough to handle the challenge of dos  .
i never owned an apple in college as i could not afford one , but i is envious of those who did as i dealt with my crappy dos machine  .
anyway , the iphone reminds me of those days the iphone interface is amazing and is so darn easy to use that i just love it  .
i just want something that works and works well and this fits the bill perfectly  .
the iphone is for the common man or woman who wants something that just works without having to take classes or read a 100 page manual in order to figure it out  .
it's so good that i'm thinking of getting them for my parents who are in their late 60's because i think they can figure it out and would really like it .
the call quality is great (o2 in the uk) , web surfing is flawless , having a camera always at hand is great  .
email works brilliantly  .
tweetie is the best twitter client on any platform  .
the phone helps me get my work done when i am out and about when it says similar products , i think they are stretching the definition of the word similar , the iphone is in a class of its own  .
the only similar product i can think of is the ipod touch .
great phone for most people i have not seen anything yet to sway me otherwise  .
love  .
for all you haters  .
buy a differe not phone  .
if anyone took my iphone away , i'd spend years plotting their slow and painful death all kidding aside , the iphone is the essential companion for me  .
having a desktop    class web    browser , with 3g speed everywhere i go is worth it's weight in gold in addition , the list of applications for the phone grows by the minute , and apps like mobilefotos , facebook , google maps , games , are all a dream to use as an it professional , it has many bonuses as well  .
it's got an ssh client , a vpn client , a vnc client , an rdp client , a telnet client , a network diagnostic testing tool , the list goes on and on but the real money    maker is the multi    touch technology  .
never has any computing device had such a powerful tool , and quite frankly it's what sets the phone apart from the rest of the pack  .
the media does not pay close enough attention to this the ability to zoom in , out , pan , across all applications , makes the interaction so intuitive it's almost instinctual  .
without it , the iphone would be just a pretty pda i would recommend this phone to anyone who wishes they could have their laptop on them at all times .
although i had been using my iphone with no problems for the first six months , i have to say that i is antsy to get more out of it  .
so i ended up jailbreaking my phone  .
now i have a customized desktop , video recorder , landscape for texting and email , multi media messaging , copy and paste , and much much more  .
so , as a product , i cannot complain at all about the iphone    now how the company launched it with so much potential untapped , that's a miss  .
seems like there will be some corrections coming up from apple tho .
to think i wasted my time getting the storm , what a pos  .
i love my iphone , and to think i didn't buy it earlier  .
well i'm glad i have the 3g because it is a better phone overall than the original  .
i do not think i can live without my wife , and of course my iphone .
really i is against the iphone for the primary reason that it is a sellout  .
everyone wanted one  .
my best friend bought one just because it is cool       he doesn't even listen to music really , so the ipod functionality meant nothing to him  .
i didn't want to be just another guy that had to have one  .
but i gave in recently when best buy offered their reward zone customers a discount i have a lot of expensive technology in my house , from my harmony one remote control to my onkyo $1000 sound system , to my gaming pc to my 57 hd    tv  .
but this iphone , let me tell you , trumps all of them  .
to be able to listen to your music and surf the net at the same time is awesome  .
the multi    touch screen is fantastic beyond comprehension everyone knows what the iphone is capable of , and how cool some of the apps are (really , they are very cool and helpful) , so i won't focus on the things you already notice  .
what i will comment on is how intelligently designed the phone is  .
what i am referring to is having earphones with a microphone so you can talk on the phone without holding the phone  .
and having a button on the microphone so you can answer calls without touching the phone  .
and the fact that the ipod will pause for you when someone calls , and then when you hang up with them or they hang up , again , don't touch your ipod because the music will come back on where it left off  .
and that little button pauses your music , too or how the iphone will remember every input jack's volume level and you never have to touch them  .
i mean if you have 8 headphones it will remember where you left the volume on each one the last time you used it same thing if you play the ipod in your car       it will remember where the volume was  .
you can also set the ipod to the home button  .
so if you're driving you can tap the home button twice and have ipod controls without having to unlock and slide the bar and access your ipod main menu (which is a pain if you're driving)  .
and once an input jack is taken out , your ipod automatically pauses itself  .
saves on battery life for you 3g  .
i don't use that crap  .
it sucks the battery like no other  .
but i can still sync work and home email just fine , browsing the internet is a little slow , but that's not a deal breaker for me  .
reception is surpisingly awesome (a lot of phones with cool functionality lack in call quality)  .
volume is great , especially with the earpiece in  .
one thing i had to get used to is that you never actually close anything       safari , ipod , mail , apps , you just minimize them always  .
it is just something i had to get used to the only con i have really is that a better battery life would be great , although with 3g off this unit stays healthy for quite a while  .
listening to the ipod doesn't really drain the battery much at all  .
neither does talking  .
it's the web surfing/pandora/email that does the most damage  .
also i spent about $70 protecting this thing  .
i bought the anti    glare screen protectors from the apple store (these are really awesome) but the case i wanted (incase slider case from the apple store) kept causing air bubbles with the screen protector  .
i had to continually reset the protector and eventually screwed up both protectors with fuzz inside them  .
bought another pack and got it right on the first try with minimal fuzz under the screen and no real noticeable air bubbles  .
protection wise       this is the best combination , but just be prepared for some irritating work that requires patience  .
the invisible shield is good but it's tough to put on and the material gets swirl marks and mars easily  .
i would recommend if you are a picky person not to get one because it's finish will look faded after time the other thing that is a negative is that the iphone is quirky  .
you will have it freeze up occasionally or it will not respond after you hang up the phone for a few seconds , etc  .
they all have some odd thing that happens from time to time , so if you get a new iphone and the first day it does something weird , do not take it back expecting that your has a problem   they all have these small issues i believe  .
just reboot every week or so and update the phone through itunes and you will be good to go bottom line is that the question people ask   is the phone worth it  .
absolutely  .
i've never been happier with a phone in my life , and really i hate to sound cliche , but this is far more than just a phone  .
impressive discovery by apple , a company which i've never been partial too and never will  .
but this device is a win for sure .
this phone is just awesome  .
i don't need to bring my laptop with me anymore  .
i would never have gotten it if i didn't have att wireless and is due for an upgrade  .
i is not unhappy with the phone i had prior to this  .
it is a nifty 3g flip    top , and i had media  .
net on that phone for an extra $15 a month  .
now i'm paying $30 a month for full internet access  .
i live in the city and 3g access is no problem  .
at home i have a wireless router and it switches right over to wifi at home  .
did i really need this phone  .
not really  .
the phone i had is fine  .
but do we really need television  .
let's say , color tv vs  .
black and white  .
this phone is just fun and awesome to use  .
i never had an ipod and i'm not a big music listener , but it is convenient to have converted all my cd's right into the iphone  .
i went to the apple store and bought a gadget that charges the phone and allows me to channel the music to an fm frequency when i got the phone i never thought i would be downloading applications and all that  .
wrong  .
the applications are cool and i love the podcasts that i can download  .
all my favorite talk radio from sports to business minus the commercials  .
i really wish they designed the iphone so the audio will come out on your bluetooth  .
in the car i can get the audio to come out on the fm via the device i bought , but when i'm not in the car i'm not going to walk around like a teenager with a pair of earphones in my ear  .
i have to assume this is a huge oversight on apple's part  .
this is a i phone  .
guys  .
how about having the audio come out on the bluetooth  .
ah well  .
the other peeve a lot of people mention is battery life  .
hey when it is this much fun to use and internet access is so simple , you're going to run down the battery  .
but my fm gadget i got at the apple store also charges the iphone , and you can charge it from the usb port from any computer so i do not find this an issue  .
despite my pet peeve about the bluetooth thing , i gotta give this phone 5 stars .
the bottom line is this   i have owned a multitude of phones  .
my most recent is the palm treo and the blackberry  .
i did not care much for the blackberry  .
perhaps i could have tried another model  .
i did like the treo 700  .
however , the apple iphone is by far the most exhilarating , user friendly workhorse that keeps delivering pleasure each day of my use of it  .
the fact that apple's customer service is probably the best in the world and the fact that they are constantly upgrading it's functionality make is a very serious machine  .
but that is not all  .
the phone's display is magnificent  .
it is easy to see  .
it is so good that it makes other phones seem useless  .
i have aggressively used this phone for both work and play for over 6 months  .
coming from verizon , i expected that the service to be a let down  .
the fact is that i have not noticed a difference in the service  .
in addition , my phone bill is about $50  .
00 less each month for unlimited service but what is like the most is that fact that i do not have to connect my phone to my computer to synchronize the way i did with the treo 700  .
this phone does it wireless and automatically  .
if you enter a contact on your computer is automatically shows up on your iphone  .
if you enter an appointment on your iphone , it automatically shows up on your computer  .
there is no need to tell your phone to synchronize this is really a beautiful phone  .
i had the first generation , which i gave to my brother  .
for a while i had to use another phone until 3g comes out  .
that is the time when i felt the absence of the iphone  .
it's a fact that everybody is competing with it , and iphone becomes the new ipod in the industry .
the phone is a work of art and taking advantage of all the apps available and all of the functionality i would recomend it to everyone  .
live life the best you can and enjoy your phone .
iphone good iphone 3g errr normal  .
i upgraded from the iphone 2g  .
this phone is worth the upgrade  .
i love apple period , i hope they keep coming out with innovative products thanks apple  .
i've used many smart phones this is far and away the best of the best  .
you will not find a better browser , interface is simplistic  .
i don't have to dig thru multiple menu's and sub    menu's to get to what i need  .
the applications continue to get cooler  .
if i did not have to use a blackberry for work , it would be for sale on ebay right now  .
over all i am very pleased with the product but if they do bring out a new 1 they need to put a decent camera in something in the range of 8mp    12mp and then for me that would be a top buy  .
best phone you'll ever find in the united states as of now  .
i love the 3g even though i only get it in town , wifi is great web browser and app store is awesome  .
as well as the ipod player , youtube is really great , the battery life lasts about 6 or 7 hours while playing a 3d game , or browsing the web  .
but overall i love this phone and it is so much better than my old blackberry curve  .
a really worthy phone .
over all i love this phone  .
i have had some great phones with windows mobile symbian , cameras , gps , everything and to be quite honest noen really compare  .
the interface is so intuitive and easy to use  .
the fact that this phone is so popular gives everyone so many resources in case something goes wrong or they want an app or even unlock the thing  .
using this phone is addicting  .
the internet browsing is far superior to any other , the email is great though i wish there is mass deletion on it as in a delete all option , i also wish there is landscape options for texting and also a factory vibration like the voyager or storm (3rd party app vibrators dont do it justice)  .
the touch screen is better than any other i have used  .
the video quality is great , music player is great , all media is great  .
the only problem is that it is locked to at t , i would suggest getting a tmobile plan and unlocking the phone while purchasing it on craigslist or something  .
the iphoen plan is rediculously expensive  .
i highly reccommend this phone  .
i am a power phone used and for those who want business/functionality , with design , fun , and class this phone is great .
i like this phone a lot best ever phone i've ever used well i made a huge jump though i just wanted the keyboard to flip anywhere when we change the position of the phone .
for all of the iphone's flaws , there can be no denying that it is an extraordinary device  .
the ability to seemlessly browse the internet has been one of the highlights of my iphone experience  .
the touchscreen works well , yet can be unresponsive and extremely delayed at times  .
most disappointing is the lack of flash  .
although webapges can be seen better on the iphone than any other that i know of , they still cannot be seen in all of their glory  .
i also miss being able to capture video and audio , and send them through text messages  .
although pictures can be sent to cell phones by email , the task is initially difficult as there are no inctructions on which domains to use (ex  .
for an at t number @mms  .
att  .
com  .
) additionally , the phone has an awful battery life , needing to be charged nightly , and is therefore not suited for a person who cannot survive long without their phone  .
the fact is though , all of these features can be almost forgotten while using the phone , for the brilliance of the device makes all of the bugs and missing features barley noticable  .
and while it would be nice to capture video , send picture messages , and have flash , the phone's true functionality is not impared  .
the iphone is quite possibly the best phone on the market today .
the iphone is incredible  .
it is way beyond a phone  .
the uses are countless and the combinations of uses even more  .
i use the phone for data storage , my ipod (of course) , misc  .
games , educational applications , gps (extremely accurate gps) , surfing the internet , getting my email , loosing weight , and on and on and on what an incredible tool i cannot believe some of the negative reviews here on this site  .
maybe they are mistaken which phone they have  .
the one i have is a work of art that gets better with each software upgrade  .
apple sold over 4 million of these phones in the last quarter and it is not a mystery why  .
hope this helps some of you .
i've owned countless smartphones , but my 3g iphone is by far the best , there's really no comparison with older attempts at handheld computers with robust communication capabilities  .
it's really not accurate to call it a smartphone , it's really a full    blown computer that you carry around in your pocket  .
i use mine constantly       web surfing , wikipedia , utility apps like a clinometer or sound decibel reader , gps location apps , etc etc  .
it's just an amazing device worthy of all the attention .
overall , this is a great product  .
the second i heard about the iphone i wanted one , but i waited until its (at the time of original production and release) flaws were fixed  .
since the release of the new iphone 3g and its many software updates , the product is now truly the best overall portable communication device on the market today  .
it's sexy , it's competitive price    wise , and it works well  .
it far outplays its competition (like the g1 , the blackberry and other smartphones) in most areas and , like apple usually does , you can bet that software and firmware updates in the future will only make it better  .
the gps system is much improved and more accurate (although not as precise as g1) , and the maps function is very handy  .
the microsoft exchange and push protocols that were just added are very useful and usually work without problems  .
its strengths far outweigh its faults and i highly recommend it to anyone who can still look past its main drawback   the price .
let me start off by saying i do not think the iphone is for everyone  .
but i did alot of research i considered alot of companies and alot of phones  .
i looked into the omnia , dare , eternity , htc touch models , and more  .
i had first decided to get an iphone then kinda talked my self out of it  .
well the more i watched videos and reviews the more i knew this phone is for me  .
first the phone is kinda secondary to me since i only use it basicly for emergencies and such texting and such is my main thing  .
i know a landscape keyboard is alot better but within a few hours i is typing wonderfully with the portrait one another thing i love is the build in ipod i is going to get a touch anyway and this kinda saved me the trouble  .
i basicly wanted something to listen to music with browse the web and just have some fun with  .
the iphone imo fit all of these perfectly for me  .
it is the greatest piece of equipment i have gotten to play with in a long time  .
i know some of the gripes no cut and paste , no voice guided gps , and other features really bug people but these may all be added and arent that big for me  .
i wanted something that looks sexy and does what it is meant to do  .
this is basicly a multimedia device with some tossed in smartphone functions  .
the push email is spot on for me  .
i do not have great 3g coverage around my area for browsing and such but i got a great wifi connection and the net is blazing fast through it well to sum up the iphone may not be the best phone for the business user but its good for people who like to have some fun with such a high end piece of equipment  .
i think business users still prefer there palms or blackberrys (i also checked out the storm but that is a train wreck from what i heard)  .
in the end this is wonderful for me and i love everything about it thus far .
i never thought i would find such a productive tool  .
i loved my treo 650  .
it is a huge step up from a really fine nokia semi    smart phone  .
the iphone (16 gig) is a huge step up over the treo i waited for this 2nd generation iphone  .
it is all i had hoped and more after 3 months i am still exploring the wide range of possibilities  .
the only apps  .
that i wish for would be an internet phone app to use in wi    fi areas  .
we have an internet phone at home for frequent calls to europe and there is no reason the iphone could not do the same in a wi    fi hot spot  .
the other wish (app  .
) would be a safe un    lock process we have used at t for years  .
love the roll    over minuets and needed a gsm phone during the time we travel in europe  .
(using an un    locked treo 650 with local pre    paid chips in each country  .
) at t's european charges are not useable , as the price is way high per minuet  .
so i do not plan to use the iphone there , unless there is a problem free un    lock method that does not risk screwing up the phone  .
the un    locked treo 650 works perfectly in europe the range of applications available for free or very little money is awesome  .
such a concept  .
i will never again think of my iphone as just a phone .
this is the first phone that i've ever had that after 6 months i don't have buyers remorse  .
even for those that bought the first generation phone over a year ago there phones continue to grow and learn  .
this is one of the only phones out there that does not become obsolete the minute you walk out of the store  .
the apps are amazing and the service seems to improve every month  .
the screen is beautiful and the navigation is spectacular  .
the iphones design is timeless similar to that of porsche , it's just the feeling you get when you hold it in your hand  .
best of all it's an american company that created this product .
i have had flip blackberry , bold , and curve  .
blackberry is the most difficult phone to use on the go  .
it is like using an old miami vice bag phone compared to the iphone  .
nothing can compare to the alien star trek phone , the iphone  .
it willbe years before the others can catch up  .
great phone  .
the only reason this phone gets bad reviews is because , these are the people that cant afford it or are too stupid to charge their phone properly ps secrest just come out of the closet already .
great phone to consolidate your ipod , phone and camera  .
at t has great service and the fact i can roam overseas without a hassle    verizon cannot do it as easy  .
got my phone at bestbuy 16gb for $289  .
99    normal price  .
only bestbuy offers accidental damage protection on the phone for $15  .
00 a month    no deductible  .
wifi is free @ any at t hotspot   starbucks , barnes and noble , and mcd  .
i recommend this phone because it does it all .
i think it is true that the iphone is 5 years ahead in technology  .
hands down it is the best device out there  .
i switched from verizon , and even though i do not like at t's service , i would still make the switch again  .
the capabilities of the phone are that great  .
it's also funny how every phone coming out these days is compared to the iphone , or is suppose to be the iphone killer  .
to me , that says a lot .
better than pocket pc better than psp better than nintendo ds , endless games and apps , just perfect  .
like the headline says , best phone i've ever had .
it's a great phone  .
delivers everything it promises .
i used to hate apple products but i got my first iphone/apple product and i love it  .
the cons that i listed to the iphone could be easily changed in a software update , such as a landscape keyboard , mms support (through the long email process of entering a persons phone number and wireless carrier into an email address format) , and as always the reception of the phone can be addressed through standard bug fixes however , this amazing phone can do just about everything else thanks to the app store that is constantly adding new and useful applications that take advantage of the accelerometer and speaker/mic  .
more full games are being published for an affordable price of $9  .
99 , some of which compete with those of the nintendo ds and sony psp the browser also makes this probably the best phone on the market for facebook , twitter , and myspace users  .
although it lacks a flash player , most of the same experiences can be duplicated on the iphone just as well as on a desktop or laptop  .
the multi    touch technology makes it a joy to zoom in and out of web pages and when double tapping on a piece of text in a webpage , the screen locks onto the textbox that it is typed in , which can save you the trouble of zooming and panning to get the best view of an article the built in ipod is also a beautiful innovative experience that can throw movies and music videos at you in spectacular resolution  .
it is easier to use and manage than any other phone simply for its compatibility with itunes and also the built in itunes music (and podcasts  .
) store the idea of this phone is that anyone can pick it up , and immediately feel like an expert on its interface  .
my vision impaired grandmother flies through menus like she is born with it in her hands , and i have not had any problems with it either although i have not experimented with the exchange support , i realize that merely its presence brings it to the business ballpark , but the phone really has no target audience  .
the only crowds that should not spend their money on this phone are textaholics and those who are extremely protective of their corporate information in their email accounts , which should not be too much of a threat since you can easily call at t and have them preform a remote wipe of all of the information on the phone  .
so if you are looking for an easy ui and have faith in apple to make the necessary software updates , then this is where you should stop searching for the best    phone    on    the    market  .
every other company out there is doing the iphony thing so i just sit back and laugh at the fools falling head    over    heels for a pos storm before it comes out and then they want to throw it in the trash when they get home  .
i am more than content  .
the iphone changes everything , since its introduction in july 2007 it has both redefined the cell phone and is the best overall cell phone on the market  .
no other phone comes close  .
over time , the iphone's power and pleasure of use actually grows  .
with nearly all other phones , their annoying defects magnify over time rendering them more and more annoying get an iphone  .
do not wait any longer  .
joy to use  .
powerful  .
great for business , and life in general updated  .
on jun 9 , 2009  .
the phone is great for what i need  .
i is an ipod touch owner which i loved the device  .
the iphone's phone call quality is great , after playing with it for a day , its actually an easy device to use  .
hours of entertainment  .
not necessariy for mr  .
business  .
the battery life is a bit short  .
i get about 3    4 hours of play time on it and maybe about 2    3 days on standby  .
in a strong 3g area im usually at about 1/2 point on signal str  .
the apps make the phone great , and the amount of media that can be stored are great for travel , work , and all around living  .
i can check my email almost anywhere , web browser is awesome , the touch screen interface is superior to any that i have used  .
wife loves hers as well own a 16gb white and 8gb black .
a major step forward for humans  .
best phone as of today  .
i would purchase a $99 iphone but the data plan is really expensive for att  .
this is one of the most versatile computer devices i have ever used  .
bring on the airport delays , long lines and waiting rooms i will never be bored again or not know what is being played on the radio  .
i'm having so much fun with this thing i forget sometimes it's also a pretty good phone too .
two generations better than the next best phone on the market  .
other touch screen phones do not hold a candle to the iphone .
buy it  .
3g is great  .
most criticisms on this phone are a little unfair  .
the perfect phone does not and will never exist    there are always compromises that need to be made in the design of a compact piece of technology  .
if you put too many features in a phone , it will end up being too big  .
sure it only has a 2mp camera    but i really don't care its a compromise as are removable batteries and so on  .
as i said , everything is about compromise    the android is supposedly better specced    but it looks and feels like a brick  .
i think this is the best phone ever made but i guess it depends on what a phone is to people in the 21st century  .
if its only about making calls , you could argue that some really cheap phones can actually do it better    but again compromises  .
as a phone in terms of making calls its more than acceptable as are most phones these days however , one of the things that this phone is able to do is use that glorious multitouch interface in order to bring applications over 3g to users around the world that they never thought they would use and now cannot live without these things  .
i never is the kind of person who would play games or browse the internet on my blackberry or other phones  .
the nature of this device means that you will use those apps for games , knowledge , news , language translation , directions , etc  .
this is an extremely useful and usuable device i still do not think that other cell phone companies have come up with the right formula yet on smart phones    perhaps with the exception of rim who mostly target corporates  .
this explains why this phone is now officially the best selling phone in american history  .
this really brings ownership of smartphones to people who never considered buying a smart phone before and in that regard , nothing else out there comes close yes it has problems such as 3g reception , but very few smart phones are trouble free the os is great  .
i think apple's iphone os and interface is as revolutionary to cell phones as windows is for pcs product of the decade  .
not perfect and has its flaws    but the advantages cannot be underestimated .
i have used many different cell phones and none have provided the overall experience of the iphone 3g  .
there is no better combination of features that i have found that work as well together  .
sure there are phones that have better specs but when you use them they just dont match up feature per feature  .
with the new 3g version apple took most of the major complaints about the original iphone and wiped them out  .
there are still many small features we'd like to see like im notifications which have been promised yet still are awaiting release  .
copy and paste is another feature many would like to see but is yet to be delivered  .
all in all though the iphone 3g is an outstanding phone that in shear measures of usability outshine aby other ,  .
this is a very good quality phone  .
it is widley known , has many cases , high technology , etc  .
third    party apps make up for the lack of most basic features , and the keyboard is very nice to type on .
if you say its over priced then you have obviously never owned one .
if you have an iphone you can never be bored  .
always new apps and new movies and songs to download  .
great  .
excellent touch screen  .
multi    touch is flawless as well as the accelerometers for performing functions  .
phone works great and the additions such as apps make it unparallel in the world of mbile phones storm and android included  .
i have read the reviews that complain about this phone for bugs and crashes  .
has anyone ever used a computer that did not crash  .
but compared to what i went through with winmobile 4 , 5 etc , this is rock solid  .
even the apps are solid compared to the russian roulette on the winmobile side i sometimes wonder if the people complaining about this have really used a smartphone at all  .
i have used this phone and the blackberry pearl , and while the pearl is good , it is clunky , and hard to learn to use , compared to the iphone  .
i am sure that the pearl is more secure , better for enterprize , for a time , but that will change , if apple keeps working hard this is a great phone , great ipod , very versatile tool to be used , played with and enjoyed .
i actual adore the iphone because it allows me to come into the cyber age without much confusion  .
the iphone makes it very easy for me to see , do , use , and just operate in general it has all the feature that i need and more  .
the internet is easy to access and very clear  .
the phone allows you to adjust size in a way that make it better to navigate any where with the phone  .
maybe becaus e i am a little older and have not had a smartphone i am just overwhelmed by the sheer genius of the total idea of the whole iphone concept and design and operation  .
this is the best phone i have ever had by any standard that i would choose to judge all my phones that i have ever had  .
the one thing that i dislike is the you can not purchase any protection plan of any type with the iphone  .
the only other thing that i can think of is a owners manual that gives more details about the basic of operation of the phone but otherwise i am really pleased with my iphone .
my son is waking up from nap so cannot write long , but let me just say this is the first review i've left for any device  .
i had to leave a review  .
this think is awesome  .
stable , robust , reliable , fun , makes life more fun and easy , with business and work  .
if you rely heavily on ms office do not get an iphone  .
if you do normal business stuff like email , rturning calls , etc  .
, its great  .
plus personal use is spectacurlar  .
i give it a 10 out of 10  .
saw somany negative reviews that i felt compelled to write this  .
and , i am a techy very educated and experienced with devices , so not coming from a 16 year old who uses it for music  .
best of luck .
phone , internet , e    mail , calendar , maps , contacts , app store , ipod (truly the best ipod ever) , and so much more  .
this phone has it all  .
i really cannot complain about it  .
those who complain about it lacking a physical keyboard , really have not actually tried to use the iphone's software keypad , because it really works well  .
i never used to text , or send e    mail , from any of my old phones , which had physical keypads , because it took forever to type anything using them  .
with the iphone , i type much faster , and do a much better job at it  .
i really enjoy using the iphone's keypad  .
the screen is gorgeous , watching movies , television shows , and other video , is very easy on the eyes  .
plus , the touchscreen makes getting into what you want , just a touch away  .
the ui is awesome , and apple has really taken care to make using the phone simple , but , fun  .
i highly recommend the iphone 3g to anyone who is looking for a great device , that is more than a phone .
cannot understand the below 4 star reviews  .
this phone is without a doubt worth every penny  .
it's light , sleek and does more than any other phone on the market  .
the internet is fantastic  .
at t's service has been exemplary  .
the sheer volume of applications available make this thing a dream .
this really is a great product , i cannot stress that enough  .
it's much more than a phone  .
it's a multimedia device , a web browser , and anything else you want it to be with the inclusion of apps the battery is not that bad at all  .
i really do not know what people expect with 3g on this phone  .
5 hours of talk time is pretty good compared to a lot of other phones out there  .
and i do get 4    5 hours of video playback with it enabled , along with at least 24 hours of music  .
turning on airplane mode helps these figures a lot  .
you will have to charge this phone daily though  .
it's not the best battery life , but it is not all that bad either  .
and 2  .
1 did help matters a little bit all in all , it's a great phone  .
i tried to keep this short and sweet and just gave overview  .
everything is great when you update to 2  .
it really is a vital update and it does help 3g calling , and coverage , also gives better battery life with video and music playback enjoy the phone  .
an amazing phone that does everything that you could want and more  .
only thing wrong with it is that it lags hardly ever  .
this phone is amazing  .
it is revolutionary and it is a pphone worth saving up for  .
i love this friggin thing  .
fun apps once you have the internet in your pocket you cannot go back  .
also the cool factor is a definite plus  .
i answer a phone call and children passing by point me out to their friends  .
people whisper about it  .
i pretend not to notice but i relish feeling cool .
this phone has blown me away    it is so sweet  .
the apps are so cool and the touch is so easy to use and phoning is a breeze  .
i have had little problems with dropped calls and internet  .
i cannot wait for the 32g and a better camera with zoom , and apple will deliver for next june 2009 i'm sure  .
always has    always will  .
no company comes close to the innovation and gorgeous products  .
it will take another 10 years for another company to even come to par with apple now .
i switched from verizon palm treo 700p to the iphone 3g white after much debate and late nights researching the phone online  .
i purchased it the 3g white for me and black for my wife from the apple store  .
what great service they gave me in setting up the phone and showing me how it worked  .
now i realized why people love their apples , it really felt as if i had joined a family  .
maybe it is just the workers at this apple store they're all really helpful the phone started off really buggy i wanted to return it v2  .
01 software  .
i then upgraded to the 2  .
02 software and the phone seemed to work a bit better  .
im in the nyc area and the coverage for edge is good 3g is spotty at best  .
its been 3 weeks now and i just upgraded to the 2  .
1 update  .
its like night and day  .
the phone is faster and 3g works better  .
especially when switching between edge and 3g works seemlessly  .
before the upgrade at least 3    4 dropped calls during the day  .
1 made a big difference on my phone and my wife's as well so far no drops  .
i look forward to more updates from apple  .
i plan on sticking with this phone  .
i is just about to return it to go back to treo but im glad im sticking it out the apps store is great besides the free software i love being able to add to my phone with programs im interested in using  .
yes some of the apps are crappy but hey just delete them i believe this phone will just get better and better as the network builds up and the phone gets updated  .
thanks apple now if i could just get myself to switch to a mac  .
(nah i love my pc but , but you never know)  .
i have never owned an apple product before the iphone and i have to say i am very impressed  .
i never realized how much i would use the internet on my phone until i got this phone  .
it is amazing and the new apps just make it better  .
there is no way i could go to another phone after this  .
everything is just so seamless  .
it all works together incredibly well  .
good work apple .
i love this phone so much .
i like it in every aspect .
i'm a first    time iphone user and am i glad i finally got one last week  .
some of the reviews here just left me speechless  .
poor battery life  .
what the heck are you trying to do  .
maybe you don't have a job and can surf for hours at a stretch , but for working stiffs like myself that periodically check mail , get online , make a few calls , listen to songs to/from work , lookup some maps , etc  .
, the battery lasts just fine till the night when i plug it in  .
visual voicemail is unbelievably beautiful  .
the whole user experience is very streamlined and consistent  .
probably the best text display i've ever seen , making it easy on your eyes for extended surfing and reading  .
automatically dims/brightens the screen perfectly  .
brilliant contacts management   one place from which to call , text , or email a person  .
syncs to my yahoo and gmail accounts seamlessly  .
maps with gps  .
ok , so gps can be a little spotty at times , but so what  .
google maps still works great and much more smoothly than full    blown gps devices  .
i can transfer photos to my pc just like with a usb stick  .
i only wish i could also use the phone as a flash drive for files , etc  .
i wish i could sync the calendar to an online calendar of my choice without going through a bunch of hoops  .
i love the app store  .
with stanza you can download bunches of books  .
ny times app downloads the day's paper so i can read it on the metro where i don't have a signal  .
more games and other time    wasting apps than you can shake a stick at , with more being added every day  .
user beware as some of these apps may be poorly written/buggy (just exercise common sense and read the reviews before downloading one)  .
you can search and download apps directly from you iphone  .
i wish i could access itunes over 3g instead of only through wifi  .
in general , i wish there is a back button for all features/apps instead of the home button  .
i also wish i could zoom and record video with the camera to sum up , this is a great device for a normal user and it lets me not have to buy a ton of gadgets  .
i have a bunch of wishes but no real complaints with apple ; although , i haven't had the phone long enough to evaluate the hardware quality  .
only gripes are with at t , but do not we all  .
write your congressman about that [originally posted for the white iphone , but the black version gets more traffic  .
this is the best phone i have ever had in my life  .
i would highly recomend it to anybody  .
i will never get a different type of phone i think  .
i've always just wanted a phone that could make calls  .
i've used web functionality on other phones and it has always been nearly unusable  .
also , phones that claim music capability have never lived up to their promise  .
none have remotely tempted me to retire my ipod by contrast , safari is joy to use and the ipod functionality if actually superior to other ipods  .
if it only had more memory , my classic might never be used again and the app store , oh the app store  .
that app store delivers on what palm promised way back when .
even with the 3 g issues i still love this product for delivering on what it promised on overall user experience .
not much more to say that hasn't already been said  .
it is sooo fun to use  .
everything is very intuitive  .
for once i don't need to hunt for the manual to figure out how to do stuff on the phone  .
some quick observations    .
app store makes looking for programs an amazing and fun experience  .
there is so much out there  .
it's like boy in a candy store  .
best web browsing experience on any portable device , hands down  .
the only thing better is a laptop  .
(and that is big and heavy  .
typing on the virtual keyboard is a lot easier than i initially feared  .
i do not miss the physical keyboard at all  .
you can also type pretty fast if you learn to trust the software to get your word right (and it does so 99% of the time)    it's all about the user interface  .
there is nothing out there that matches the touch screen responsiveness and feel of the iphone  .
and believe me , it's the user interface that makes a phone fun (or not so fun) to use    battery life is pretty good  .
the only thing i've found that drains the battery really fast is push and if you have the gps running constantly (but that happens with any device)  .
if i set the iphone to check for messages every 15 minutes (and who cannot wait 15 minutes to get a message  .
) , the battery is ~75% full after a day's use (calls , web browsing , etc  .
this is with wifi and 3g turned on and screen brightness turned to ~25%  .
however , i am usually around a wifi hot spot for most of the day    it's a personal preference , but i really love the anti    glare film  .
you can buy this online or at the apple store  .
it  dramatically  decreases fingerprints , and feels surprisingly really nice too  .
(unlike the invis  .
shield which makes the screen sticky)  .
the screen is not quite as sharp with the anti    glare film , but for me , the slight softening of the image , and the decreased glare actually make the images and text look more pleasant    a lot of the so called deficiencies (ie  .
voice dialing , which never worked on my previous phone anyway) is made up for by applications that you can find in the app store    reception is as good as any other phone  .
no better or worse (at t)    word of warning  .
understand that the applications are new and so there might be a few bugs  .
the good thing is that itunes makes it easy to get updates to the programs .
smartphone needed  .
nothing better out there nothing even close  .
i love this phone  .
it is worth every penny i paid for it  .
i think it beats any other phone like the lg vu or the samsung instinct .
i live in the chicago land area and the 3g reception is outstanding , i cant even tell a difference when im using wifi or 3g  .
so for people that live in the middle of no where , stop complaining about 3g reception because there probably is none for now  .
the application store has apps for every type of person  .
the multimedia , gps and the touch screen response are excellent  .
this is the best phone out there period before i purchased the iphone i is considering some of thos iphone copy    cats , such as the samsung glyde , lg voyager or lg vu  .
those phones feel cheap , the touch screens dont even compete with the iphone's touch screen  .
what more could you want , phone , ipod , gps , internet and an amazing application store  .
this is truly an excellent phone .
this cellphone/ipod/pda is near perfection  .
sadly no device can be perfect but iphone is close .
an already amazing product gets even better  .
i had the original iphone since it came out , and is blown away with that  .
now with the 3g i am amazed at all the things it can do , its capabilities and the beauty of the phone  .
it's an excellent design and function .
let me start by saying i never give a 10 to anything but in the case of the iphone it is so far ahead of anything else out there i had to give it a 10  .
granted it does not do everything , ie would have loved to have a2dp stereo bluetooth , but the things that it does do it does very well  .
i have been a sprint customer since i have owned a cell phone which is 10    15 years and initially it is because they would come out with the newest phones before any other carrier , which is no longer the case  .
i tried the 1st generation iphone for a few months and is impressed but not enough to make me leave sprint  .
had high hopes for the samsung instinct but touch technology does not compare to iphone  .
i recently upgraded to treo 800w with windows mobile and purchased the new 3g iphone to test and compare for the 30 days to see which one i like better  .
i can tell you that after a week of using both the treo is going back and the iphone will be my new phone  .
i is impressed with the last iphone but the 3g phone is that much nicer and i think that the deal maker for me this time is the app store  .
i downloaded a few of the apps aol radio , pandora , bloomberg and is amazed that within minutes the apps are up and running on your iphone  .
in my mind i just see this phone getting better and better in the future and everone else playing catchup  .
i see alot of negative reviews on cnet and i do not know what phone you are using because i have owned and tested several and the iphone is head and shoulders above them all  .
if this phone is so bad there would not be so many imitators aka iphone killers out there  .
they say imitation is the highest form of flattery so to all of you samsung instinct and lg dare owners the owners of the originator would like to take this moment to thank you for the complement  .
i love my iphone , i'm not a bias apple fan (although i have a mac , but i also own a pc and have windows on my mac) , but using this phone for what it is made for is soooooo much better than using other phones , the ipod touch style media player is amazing , the email is easy to use and setup , calender syncs perfectly , the phone quality is good , and the internet is 100 times better than anything i've used on other phones (opera 9  .
5 , ie for windows mobile)  .
it does what it is originally made for perfectly and more  .
they also do updates that are constantly adding/improving features , since i bought it it has just gotten better  .
camera could be higher than 2  .
0 mp but i owned a sony ericsson k800i cybershot phone and it was not really that much better quality wise , plus this phone costs enough already and can be compared to buying an ipod nano 8gb plus a good smartphone , and if you change that to an ipod touch it's even cheaper (all this based on an unsubsidized iphone anyway)  .
and the touch keyboard is awesome unlike what many people think , i did a speed test and i typed 41 wpm on the first try , as long as you trust the technology behind the keyboard it's awesome .
the only reason i am posting this is the difference i just saw when my sister showed me her lg dare  .
what a piece of junk compared to my iphone  .
the dare cannot even scroll through the contacts without being buggy  .
i won't even go into high detail but the iphone has the perfect browser , the perfect operating system , games , music do i have to go on  .
does your phone do what the iphone does  .
then quit bashing it all you apple haters who don't even own one  .
even cnet , who i think are one of the most biased sites on the internet against apple have to give it a win in every 'prize fight'  .
when that happens you can no longer post negatives  .
as for all the whiners who talk about 'cost' , you are just being silly  .
the plan cost of an iphone is completely comparable to any unlimited data plan phone without adding in the free things like free games , free gps , etc  .
if verizon even had the iphone they would never let you have the app store or free gps  .
my sister showed me her laggy dare with all its 'stuff' , but what good is it  .
she is not going to pay an extra $10 a month for gps , she is not going to pay an extra $10 a month for vcast , and she is not going to pay every month for being able to access the web  .
what good is her phone  .
the iphone is a steal so wise up and admit it  .
even the apple haters at cnet have  .
at t service is fantastic where i live and i travel the whole east coast where i have never been without service and have better service than anyone in my family on verizon  .
one bar at my house with verizon 5 bars at my house on at t  .
i'm a happy camper  .
cannot we all just get along and quit bashing what you do not own  .
life is too short  .
i have held off jumping into writing a review of the iphone 3g deliberately because of all the euphoria and hype surrounding its launch you can so easily get carried away with it , so now nearly 3 weeks after getting my hands on one it is time to share my thoughts on the good the bad and the ugly sides of this years most anticipated phone externally  .
from the outside there are hardly any differences to the untrained eye , looking a bit closer , the switches on the left hand side of the phone are now metal and the rear of the iphone 3g is now all plastic instead of the much classier looking aluminium of the previous incarnation  .
the rear of the phone is the only stand out difference and it can be had in a black finish on the 8 gig and 16 gig versions and all white in the 16 gig flavour only  .
the plastic is not a cheap type of plastic but does look very nice although it attracts finger prints  .
the back is also curved as the iphone 3g is slightly fatter but the way the rear is tapered it is very hard to tell that this is the case everything else appears to be the same from the outside including screen size and resolution , however the external speakers have definitely been beefed up as listening to music with them is much louder and clearer than the original iphone model , i tested this last night with two identical songs playing and the iphone 3g totally drowned out the original iphone and is still crystal clear where the latter is distorted whats all the hype about this 3g then  .
well as the iphone is a connected internet phone in all senses , 3g is a major addition to the device , to get the most from the iphone involves web surfing , email gathering and many other data intensive tasks happening quickly , over edge or gprs this is at best slow but mostly painful , over wifi it is a great experience  .
now imagine having a wifi connection with you all the time and that is what 3g can give you , once you have it , you cannot give it up , its fantastic  .
i did a few speed tests and i is getting some pretty fast speeds as you can see below , the downside is 3g coverage is by no means brilliant and can be very patchy but when it is available it works great onboard gps  .
another new feature of the iphone 3g is integrated gps , you know the technology that powers tomtom and other satellite navigation systems to give you turn by turn directions to where you need to get too , unfortunately it does not work like this as of yet on the iphone 3g , what you do have is a very accurate gps chip that on average pin points you to within 10 feet of where you are , you can then use this with various social networking tools to show your location , handy yes but not really what we need gps for  .
the other option is to run it with the google maps application  .
this application needs a connection to the internet as it downloads the map data on the fly and does a great job , but again no turn by turn navigation or voice prompts so for me the gps in the iphone is not very good at all  .
it is a wasted bit of technology and we do not know if we will ever see a proper application to offer what full gps should be  .
google maps does fill in some of the blanks but on my visit to france if i used it , it would have cost hundreds of pounds in roaming data charges just to see where i is going  .
for now a separate tomtom is still needed so a big cross next to gps for now battery life  .
having the 3g and gps switched on totally blows your battery , i think it has come as a big shock to people who havent used a 3g device before , but be prepared to charge your device every day and probably more often than that  .
when you first get the iphone 3g give it at least a weeks worth of charges and discharges before panicking as the battery needs to work its way up to full capacity  .
if you are in a weak 3g area the phone will be constantly switching between 3g and gprs \ edge coverage which can really eat the battery , i would suggest turning 3g off in this case and only switching it on when you need it , apple really should have had easy access to this with an on screen icon or even an on/off switch similar to the ringer switch , this would have been a great addition , same for gps too  .
once you are conditioned to how the battery performs you will be able to live with it , although for me a car charger is a necessity compatibility with previous iphone accessories  .
the only difference hardware wise that will cause problems with older accessories is that apple have removed the pins from the iphone 3g that allowed charging via firewire  .
not a big problem you might think but a lot of manufacturers actually used this charging method in docks and especially car integration kits as it worked on 12v and the usb pins work on 5v  .
i have a dension gateway 100 which charged my original iphone and transferred music to the car speakers through the iphone dock port , when i connect my iphone 3g to the kit , it will not charge but does work for transferring the music , not a great solution due to the battery problems already mentioned  .
dension are working on a replacement model but this means spending more money on a new system the next parts cover the iphone 2  .
0 software , which is available on the iphone 3g and the original iphone through a software upgrade via itunes the app store  .
the app store is a breath of fresh air , we all know about the iphone sdk and what it would bring , well here are the fruits , either downloading through itunes or over the air apps are now available for either version of the iphone  .
at launch and up to this point however it has to be said they are nothing to write home about , sure on the application side we have a few decent twitter apps , talking language phrase books and quite a few totally useless applications but nothing substantial  .
i think it is totally unfair to judge the iphone platform at this stage on the apps that are available , windows mobile fans have jumped on the limitations of the app store and i agree in comparison at this stage it is inferior , but give it 6 months and i believe we will see a lot more useful applications and a lot from the big mobile software houses to push the iphone into the big league games wise the iphone is going to be an important platform , at launch we already have super monkey ball and crash nitro kart , both of these games show the power of the iphone and what we can expect in the future and that is a great gaming platform without a doubt now the downside , apple have made the iphone app store a closed shop , in other words without their approval you cannot get an application out , great we thought this will ensure the quality of the applications and prevent the problems we have seen with windows mobile , like system freezes and regular soft resets , well from my experience this is not the case , running firmware version 1  .
4 even jailbroken with a few third party applications i never had to reset my iphone , since the 2  .
0 firmware i am resetting at least once every few days and in between i am thrown out of applications back to the home screen regularly , it is not the greatest experience so far and needs to improve , maybe apple rushed a few things out so they would have some applications available at launch  .
the good news is , if you buy an application or download one of the many free applications and there is an update available then it shows up straight away and you are able to update it straight from the iphone or through itunes , nothing like that is available on windows mobile which brings us nicely round to how apps are installed on the iphone , two options are available  .
the first via itunes on a mac or pc , you can browse the app store exactly how you would the music store , the software is categorised and easily searched through , click an app you would like to install , download it then just sync your iphone as normal and thats it  .
if you want too , you can also just load up the app store on your iphone home screen and again you are given various options to find applications by category or search by name or description  .
the apps can be downloaded and installed over the air by cellular network or wifi but there is a limit on size for his method , any app over 10 mb must be sourced through the itunes store on a mac or pc  .
to uninstall apps you can just delete them as normal on the iphone home screen or removed them from itunes and sync , it is as simple as that  .
it really is a seamless experience exchange activesync  .
if you have ever used a windows mobile device with an exchange server then you will be well aware of how good activesync works over the air , dont be fooled for one moment that this has anything to do with the horrendous windows program for the pc as it doesnt thank god  .
this is the service that allows full push email , which means when an email arrives in your exchange email account it is automatically pushed straight to your iphone , i have tested this since day one and it works absolutely perfectly  .
add to this contact and calendar synchronisation too and it really becomes a fantastic solution  .
you put a new contact into your iphone when you are out and about and it immediately is pushed to your exchange account so when you get home , fire up outlook on your mac or pc and its there in your contacts already  .
similarly appointments , two way sync and no need for any docking or cable connections , a brilliant addition to the iphone firmware if you do not have an exchange account they are a couple of alternatives , the first being a hosted account through a company like 4smartphone or apple themselves are offering a service called mobileme which is supposed to offer exchange like functionality for a yearly cost  .
the latter has suffered with a few teething problems so far so it would be worth reading up on these before making any commitments calculator  .
the calculator application has had a bit of a makeover too , it looks the same in vertical mode , but turn the iphone to a horizontal position and calculator flips to reveal a full scientific calculator , very smart safari  .
not a lot of changes with the safari browser although it does seem to render pages much faster now and has the added ability to save images which we never had before , but we still can not view any flash animations or videos within safari , click a youtube link for example and safari is left behind and the youtube video will play in the specific software player , a bit of a shame as it is touted as having the full internet screenshots  .
as standard we can now take screen shots and save them directly to the camera roll in pictures , simply hold down the home button and press the top on/off button and the screen will go blank then return and then you have the screen shot , a handy feature camera  .
nothing physical has changed , it is still the lowly 2 megapixel lense although apple do claim to have improved the quality through software , i havent noticed any change and if you want a phone with a good quality camera this is not for you , personally i dont care for cameras in phones i have a stand alone camera that will always produce better pictures than any phone camera i have seen so it is not an issue  .
one glaring omission though is lack of video support , another simple application that we need in our phones bluetooth connectivity  .
rubbish best describes what is available on the iphone and the iphone 3g , you can connect to a headset or a car kit and that is your lot , where the heck is a2dp , this is a music phone after all and this should be standard , come on apple , also why can i not connect to my laptop via bluetooth or with a cable and share the 3g internet connection , windows mobile has had this feature for years and how come i cannot do any file transfers either , it really is poor that these simple things are missing messaging  .
email is as near perfect on a phone as you can get with the iphone in my opinion , no complaints at all , but sms lacks the simple function of being able to forward a text message , or for that matter send a contact to someone else , all features seen in the most basic phones as standard  .
mms , why is mms still missing from the iphone , again it is available on most cheap phones these days and whilst not a critical application it is handy to have when you need it , it should be there as standard lack of copy and paste  .
this one for me is totally unforgivable , it totally cripples the iphone and the potential of future apps , whilst writing this an application has been launched for wordpress , it is a great app but unusable for me without copy and paste , could someone please explain why this is not a standard , unbelievable omission again conclusion  .
the iphone 3g is a fantastic phone , brilliant user interface , now with the added benefit of 3g speeds , third party applications and gps but it is still the little things that are letting this phone down badly  .
until apple wake up and listen to what people want then this phone will remain a flawed genius  .
potentially brilliant but when will we see the simple boxes ticked off to meet that potential , if we do then this phone is a real winner and will be a keeper for a long time , if it doesnt happen then windows mobile 7 could overtake the iphone quite easily with the right user interface matched to its already superior feature list positives  .
multi touch interface and usability  .
3g speeds  .
music playback and storage  .
the app store  .
safari browser  .
email integration  .
negatives  .
battery life  .
gps functionality  .
poor applications at launch  .
too many missing simple functions  .
no copy and paste  .
no tethering  .
i've read alot of reviews about the new phone and most people seem to be putting their noses up to the new iphone , barking about missing features and what not , bla , bla , bla business people are whining that its not powerful enough to use in a super busy business setting , trendy people are whining about no mms , battery life and other petty things that you can find on a cheaper phone  .
i am a practical person i'm not an executive and i'm not a weenie with no life that is constantly glued to my phone all day i'm just a normal guy that loves the idea of having a phone built around a device that can hold all my music , photos and movies , can give me directions where i want to go , show me my emails and recieve calls all in one device  .
i'm practical and for the $$ , i think this phone delivers alot of value for the price there are andless possibilities with the app store offering more and more every day  .
yea , some of the apps are dissapointing and just plain useless , but i've found a few that are really practical for everyday situations like seeing what movies are playing in my area , tagging a song i hear on the radio and identifying it , giving me a daily horroscope , etc i dont need all the extra caca that i hear some of these people crying about most practical people buy an iphone because its an absolute joy to use , beautiful to look at and recognize that its a phone built around a media device  .
its not a plutonium powered superphone designed to do everything but , with future updates , there is no limit to potential you business folk , go get a blackberry or a treo you trendy nerds that want to use your phone as a camera or to send videos , go get a sidekick if you like the idea of having a device that can entertain you while being able to do practical everyday tasks , i personally think this is a outstanding device and get alot of use out of mine never leave home without it except so so call quality , and misleading phone plan rates by att they suck .
best consumer smartphone i have used  .
it is completely different user experience compared to other products .
this is absolutely the best phone i have ever had in my lifetime  .
the phone is ready for prime time but needs to fiz to 2  .
0 bugs  .
this is a great phone for anyone who wants to be able to access their email , play music , watch videos , make phone calls , take pictures , play games , and much more  .
alot of people complain about the camera only be 2 mega pixels , but the photos are decent if you are just going to be printing them on 3x5 normal photo paper  .
the app store adds so much more capabilities to this phone  .
the gps is very fast at locating where you are (and more often than not even inside  .
)i cannot wait for someone to release a turn    by    turn direction app for the iphone (which apple has said is in the works by some)  .
i recommend this phone to all  .
also , some complain about the data plan being expensive , but compared to that of a blackberry , it is much better and gps is free on the iphone  .
it doesn't bother me that it does not have a text plan along with the data plan , because if you have a family plan with unlimited texts it's only $20 total and that covers everyone on your family plan  .
great product , great price , go get one  .
its the only phone i have ever liked , its the only phone that i actually want to spend money on , before the iphone phones to me were boring , a plastic shell on the outside and absolutely nothing on the inside  .
they had os' that felt like they were coded in some teenagers basement  .
the iphone has a desktop class os , its more like a mini computer then a phone  .
its also a great new platform that we will see evolving into what will be the next generations computers , the post computer era there's spectacular apps that go from gaming to entertainment to business  .
the iphone breaks the barrier between fun and business , you no longer have to carry a boring hard to use , yet somewhat pretty blackberry as the iphone now has all the business features you can ask for  .
the quality and design of this phone is incomparable , like the os no one comes close  .
an un    scratch    able glass screen and a solid plastic back , no part of the phone feels weak or cheap like most other phones , its one solid device  .
the minimal design is hands down the best designed phone or electronic device period  .
its quite obvious why jonathan ive won a black pencil for the first one  .
in short no other phone on the market can even come close to the iphone and when competitors finally do catch up it will be to late , as apple already is ahead of the curve and always keeping 2 steps ahead is a big advantage in this market .
i have owned lg voyager for 6 months now before i purchased iphone  .
i am not sure why people are complaining about this phone  .
it's very sleek , gorgeous and damn easy to use  .
i personally found it very innovative  .
i know i miss my mms and video features i used in lg but it's not that impossible to use in iphone  .
i can always send pictures via emails (comon few more taps are hard for ya lazy geeks  .
and there is already one video application on the way which will let you use iphone to take some video  .
seriously i have not seen any other phone with 1  .
clarity of iphone sound 2  .
easy to use apps 3  .
perfect technology in touch screen 4  .
more then 500 new apps 5  .
great integration with mobile me/yahoo/gmail accounts 6  .
top notch video/music player  .
i love to read people whining about what this beautiful phone is missing instead of enjoying it and again if you don't like it then please go back to your blackberries and do not mess up ratings of this phone and mess up with brains of potential buyers who wants to enjoy apple's innovative product  .
thanks  .
the best phone ever  .
i really like the phone and would buy it over again 100 times  .
and i really think it's the best phone on att and i'v tried alot of them  .
the ability to psynch to my touch , imac , ibm , and g5 powerbook is awesome  .
sadly my nokia n75 will never see the light of day again , along with my palm tungsten c  .
apple has hit a home run in delivering a great product for the money with a lot of totally cool factored in  .
this platform will grow and develop more options over time  .
for now , awesome  .
i is shocked to find any reviews less than 9 for this product  .
i'm not sure if these people lived on another planet before coming to earth where something better is available , because their standard are a bit high  .
there has never been a product like the iphone that does so much in such a small and elegant package  .
some reviewers try to offer alternative products that do the same thing , but nothing does the same thing like the iphone does  .
it does everything well and intuitively , if those other products were the same then their share price would be as high as apple's and they would have people still in line 4 days after the launch waiting to get one  .
when's the last time you saw a line outside a verizon store to get the latest phone never  .
that is all the evidence you need that this phone is revolutionary .
seems nice i is smart enough to not buy a 2g i phone like a silly guinea pig and get beta    tested so my first experience with it is pretty damned good  .
attracts a lot of attention ; took a friend to an appointment and had it out in the waiting room , and everyone is like oooooo , ahhhhhhh  .
very satisfying  .
call quality is good , its a frigging cell phone so i never expect crystal clear sound  .
use a landline or talk in person for christsakes  .
15 years ago you wouldn't have had a cell phone to   about sound quality unless you were well to do  .
hell you spent 200 for the phone at least , so go buy a jawbone blue tooth you big baller you and stop whining  .
battery weak you say  .
well buy a car charger , and stop watching the videos all the damned time the mobile apps suck and needs more software should not you be working , driving , studying or paying attention to your kids  .
to all the bad reviewers awwwwwww , sounds like you all didn't even get one  .
you're just hating cause your money was not up and you couldn't get it  .
and even if you do not like it sell it for 700    1500 to some dingbat online and buy something else  .
what more could you ask  .
most people use reviews to compare other products or what the didn't come with i do not feel that's the proper way to do a review  .
the designers/engineers had an agenda so the product is what it is , so the device should be review as such with that said , everything on this phone works brilliantly ; from the interface to the music player , to the app store , etc i digress to the brilliantly from above  .
the only hitch i have with my iphone is the occasional sluggishness when opening certain apps ; sms , maps it is a stunning device with great functionality  .
sure other features would be nice  .
but rating this product as it is , it's still amazing i love my 16gig black iphone 3g  .
i hope this is helpful to you .
there's a reason why everyone tries to copy the ipod , and similarly why people try to copy the iphone  .
if you're reading this review you already know what i'm talking about in the coming years you can bet apple will simply increase it's market share of the personal digital assistant while setting the bar higher and higher for others to try and imitate but never replicate the iphone has the speed that makes using it a pleasure , software that is smart and elegant and features that get the job done  .
for those who don't care about style , it's still the best pda with the most potential if you were waiting for the right time to buy an iphone then i'd suggest you run out and get one    if you do not mind waiting in line for 5    7 hours .
this is the best phone 3g gps  .
even with the cons , this is the best phone i have ever had  .
would buy it again in a heartbeat  .
it is so easy to pick up and use you just do not want to put it down  .
it's so much more than a phone it's the internet in your pocket .
i am so glad i waited for the 3g flavor of the iphone  .
it is mindboggling as to what it can do and with such ease  .
the user interface is perfect  .
the plan is a tad bit expensive but hey , i am not complaining  .
it is truly like carrying a computer in your pocket .
i'm mainly writing this review to offset the bad reviews by people that haven't even owned the phone  .
a lot of them review based on what they've read on the news instead of reviewing based on actually using the phone  .
if i didn't have to offset the ridiculous reviews i'd actually give the iphone 3g an 8/10 i is a blackberry user before and although i do miss some things about my bb , i couldn't say that i would trade my iphone 3g for it  .
although the iphone doesn't support mms and copy and paste , i'm ok with that  .
the revolutionary internet browsing capabilities and app store alone (amongst many other wonderful things) make this phone a great device  .
some have reviewed that this phone is not perfect and tbh , what phone is  .
there's always going to be something new and better that not every phone can keep up with i've had this phone for 3  .
5 days now , and i can say that it's been the best phone i've had (just a slight edge over my blackberry)  .
there are many other wonderful phones out there who don't get as much hype but that's not apple's fault if you're looking to buy this phone , then i highly recommend it  .
although society is not always correct , most of the time they are and there's a reason why there's such a big hype around this product  .
i did not get the iphone because of the hype , i got it because it syncs better with my mac  .
if blackberry synced with my mac a lot better (because pocketmac sucks) then i probably would have stayed  .
however , now that i have the iphone , i'm glad i did take the plunge sure , it's short on some basic features but eons ahead in others  .
give and take pick and choose everyone has their priorities in features that make a good phone  .
mine are on the iphone (and blackberry    except for pocketmac) .
this is absolutely the most fun , advanced , easy to use , sexy , personal smartphone , cellphone ever  .
i upgraded from my original iphone and the iphone 3g is absolutely even better  .
there is nothing that is in the iphone's class  .
everything else is a poor copy or bizarro cell phone  .
i can now use this at work where we have microsoft exchange  .
blackberry is dead  .
the touch screen allows me to write longer text messages and email than i ever wrote with a thumb keyboarded blackberry .
the only useful things i'd like them to improve is more on    board memory and a better camera with video recording as for some of the other mentioned cons     .
voice dialing    .
me   call barry pearson  .
phone   dialing mary johnson  .
me   runs into tree to prevent accidentally calling ex    wife instead of stock broker  .
flash    .
when i run flash on my computer , it gets hot and uses tons of processor power and battery  .
it takes a long time to load and sometimes crashes the browser  .
in addition , a good chunk of flash content is ads , which i can live without  .
i do not want this on my iphone stereo bluetooth    .
i hate cords as much as the next person , but transmitting high quality audio over bluetooth is currently neither reliable nor mainstream most computers in my life seem to have daily problems that i must work around  .
i enjoy using the iphone because it actually works p  .
cnet actually warns against giving a rating of 10 out of 10  .
that's another feature that annoys me about most computer  .
just let me do what i want .
best smart phone by far  .
this is a phone , computer , gps , pda , ipod , apple got it perfect  .
i bought 3 (one for me , my wife , my son) and we all love them  .
basically getting a great mobile computer for super low price  .
app store is great    already bought 4 apps (2 free and 2 paid for)  .
i recommend apple iphone 3g to all .
kent said it all ill take his review over any of these guys that got one early  .
i got one at columbia , md apple store  .
inline friday 345pm til 1115pm (730 hrs) white 16gb .
how can this have the same rating as the lg voyager  .
c'mon  .
we all know this phone is in a league of it's own  .
quit bashing it and just embrace it .
people need to give this phone the respect it deserves  .
it really is on another level when compared to other phones  .
go ahead and buy a diff phone , you know you'll always be craving the iphone .
i have owned blackberry , palm , basic flips , zune , pretty much every excuse not to go apple  .
now i have realized that once you give apple a chance it will truley change your life  .
simple , effective , intuitive , tactful , fun , sleek , liquid smooth , amazing  .
with 3g , wifi , gps , visual voicemail , superior web browsing , exchange service , and the app store , what else could you really need  .
no one uses voice dialing  .
great phone with a load of extra features  .
the smooth access with applications and internet surfing brings a whole new level of speed to it now even higher processor  .
let the button thumping berry people have their fun  .
i'll continue to enjoy my touch sensitive flat screen .
well    its hard to review an unreleased product , but seeing the negative numbers makes me think it is competitors trashing this product hence a little back and forth in the name of unbiased coverage the cons against this phone are goofy no video record , no mms  .
come on  .
stereo bluetooth  .
geez  .
the browser and ipod aspects are so amazing that its a wonder to use anything else  .
tethering would be wonderful  .
but still that would make it an 11 , 12 or  .
ohh  .
and i love my phone to have multiple colors , like pink , beige and purple  .
no question this is the best phone out there  .
there is not a single other phone thats worth a penny , i would not spend anything on a phone until the iphone came because until now , all phones were crap .
apple has definitly out done themselves with the iphone 3g and the price cut makes it extremely affordable  .
the only bummer is no multimedia messaging but i have some hope that a developer will create an app for the iphone that we can all download from the app store  .
it's a great touch screen phone with lots of fun games and useful apps , great music and video quality , fine camera , sleek design , good display , and many other features .
this phone does live up to they hype surrounding it  .
however you have to be willing to deal with the poor customer service of at t's phone service , and outrageous rate plans  .
but the phone in its self is amazing .
i like this product a lot it has really fast internet and i have lots of fun on it  .
if i could change one thing it would be so i can send pictures to people  .
this is the best phone i ever had and i , m just worried that i going to break it because i heard that if u drop it the sceen will break  .
it has lots of apps which is cool but it make the phone lower  .
my favorite thing about the iphone is that i can liten to music and go on the internet and call someone with one thing in my pocket .
i did a lot of research , and as i said in the one    line summary , this phone does what i expected it to do , very well  .
yes , it's missing some features that other phones have , and some of those are disappointing , but over    all i'm very happy with the iphone  .
i don't ever wish i could send or receive mms (my friends/family don't really use it) and lack of flash is only mildly annoying for me    i do not want to kill the battery by watching video on the thing when i'm not at home and when i'm at home i watch on a bigger screen the biggest thing for me are the apps  .
the huge variety of apps let me to continuously add more customized functionality to the phone so that it just gets better and better  .
i checked out reviews for apps (most of them free) before i ever bought the iphone to make sure the phone + apps would do what i needed it to     .
+ keep track of contacts ,  .
+ calendar ,  .
+ notes for work / school / personal matters ,  .
+ check send email ,  .
+ take quick pics / videos to capture those crazy or cool things you just have to share ,  .
+ carry a photo album with me ,  .
+ use twitter facebook ,  .
+ listen to public radio on the go ,  .
+ keep track of my finances ,  .
+ check out the full web ,  .
+ read e    books ,  .
i do a lot more than this with my phone , but these were essential to me and like i've said twice already , the iphone does these all very well  .
as for battery    life i keep an eye on it , and i've never run out of juice before finishing my day and coming home for the evening .
it's a amazing device , and i think apple made a good breakthrough with this device , i don't have many problems with it , and it's a good web surfer too  .
p it's a perfect phone for me , i do not like how we cannot get voice control , and we have to buy a totally differnet product to make it work , esspecially with the videos , how stupid is that , jail breaking has no problem recording video .

Intuitive touchscreen, 3G speed, great browsing experience, all those features on one device, GPS, App store; No video recording, no camera zoom, some apps unstable, AT&#38;T's ridiculous plans.
The iPhone Interface, The Apps, Exchange, 3G, GPS, iPod, Videos, Development Program, Remote Control, it goes on and on; Curved back makes it roll more easily when tapping on the table.
The internet browser, the style, the ipod, the speaker, the 3g (Albuquerque area), the screen, the responsiveness, the new apps.; The lack of flash, and tethering would be cool.
Everything; Could have a better camera and cut and paste etc. but these will be fixed in upgrades.
Its apple, its smooth, it never freezes, app store, itunes, pictures, you name it all in one! No windows mobile stupid crap; At and T can be expensive service
1)3G is so much faster than EDGE. 2)GPS is Great for checking where you are and location based services(like loopt and geo tagging); 1)no camera upgrade. 2)no copy and paste. 3)no background processes
Everything about the phone is amazing. My five star rating is based solely on the phone and not on AT&#38;T; AT&#38;T service is not that good. NYC area.
Ease of use, Fast Internet, Email easily accessible, best multimedia phone I've seen; No landscape keyboard, no copy &#38; paste, needs better camera, apps sometimes crash
Love it, coming from Samsung first gen blackjack and this phone crushes it.; None so far other than sending pics via mms. they say with 3.0 it will be fixed.
amazing web browser - and music player!. apps are great and from/function is massive; could use video app, as well word/excel type apps.
i like the accelerometer which makes the games allot more interesting and more enjoyable to play; i am disappointed with the camera only being 2mp
Fun to use. Full internet access via 3G or WIFI. Applications are cool.; No audio via bluetooth for music and podcasts.
Easy to use, delivers what is advertised, great value; I liked the metal back on the iPhone 1, no FM tuner
- much faster than the original iphone. - great apps. - movies &#38; videos look fantastic. - no need for an ipod. - thinner &#38; lighter profile; - short battery life. - itunes movie rental agreement stinks. - too heavy to run or exercise with. - new shape doesn't fit the old cradles
This phone is way ahead of its time, will change your life.; You are going to be making up stuff if you do not buy one. Why lie to yourself?
-syncing with the mac is great. -great mulitmedia. -ease of use is unmatched. -3.0 update solves most problems.; -battery life could be better. -touch screen not for everyone
Everything is freaking perfect on this phone. I had it since it came out.; Keybord but they will have a new update soon and we will have everything.
Everything; Nothing that isn't AT&#38;T's fault! I'd say the only real downfalls have to do with AT&#38;T's policies and slower network as opposed to anything to do with the phone.
i luv the iphone 3g with the new 2.2 software beacause battery is increased call reception and other stuff; 3g sucks ***** because it kills ur call reception
I don't know what everyone's whining about. I get crystal clear 3G reception everywhere I go. I got GPS, I have my songs, I got games, I got remote access to my computers, the potential to grow is near endless.; battery is a little weak. I recharge every other day.
Touch screen, easy phone dialing, internet, apps-unbelievable, ipod-wow,; battery life- not such a factor now since 2.1 release, typing is still a struggle, camera- but i only use it for snapshots of cool things I need, not for family outings
Everything. Ease of use, power, portability, style. The way it replaces every other gadget. The expandability through the app store.; I would like a laser measuring device so I can do building surveys. And a much more accurate GPS, down to millimetres, so I can take site levels.
Touchscreen. Great camera. Killer Browser. Easy Controls. FAST. Plenty of downloadable Apps. Every App included with the phone. iTunes. App Store. GPS; The Big One: Doesn't support Flash. Touchscreen can be unresponsive or delayed. No video. No MMS. GPS can be off. Web pages can be unresponsive. LOW battery life. App store is messy. Odd Glitches
Waited for the 3G and it was worth it! Liked it so much, bought them as gifts for family.; Must be on wifi to download music from iTunes
Makes my business and personal life much more entertaining and easy! can't beat it; Not many! Really! Battery life a little weak but not too restricting actually, unless you are one of those people who spend 14 hours per day in heavy use and away from charger like NYC commuters...
It has everything GPS 3G the apps are getting better as the games.!!!!!!!!!; when I was with AT&#38;T dropped calls and lilttle time with 3G. Now I have T-mobile with it I'm using Turbo sim.
Everything on the phone is a pro; Only thing I miss really is stereo bluetooth because I could really use it, but I fixed that with an adapter so no worries.
Great touch screen response, 3g, greatest multimedia capabilities, sleek sexy design,great clear call quality, beautiful full html browser-feels like your using the web on a laptop, application store; I've had this phone for 3 weeks now and i havent found any.
Very intuitive, touch screen is remarkable, application selection is huge, and call quality is solid.; Speaker phone still not adequate, Occasionally seems to halt the UI while the iPhone downloads mail, does not allow tethering to a laptop for wireless data connection.
Lots and lots of cool apps and games. Awesome games like Need for Speed Undercover and Hero of Sparta can be downloaded. Great Design. Good camera quality. Video is really impressive. Great music features. Lots of other features.; Loading times in Youtube videos and Browser pages were sometimes long. No built-in GPS.
Amazing display.. The keyboard knows what I want to type 98% of the time.. Safari browser is great.. Good UI. Amazing App Store. Call quality is perfect on my end. Slow data on Edge actually isn't that slow where i live.. iPod is amazing.; Slow sometimes.. Apps crash sometimes. Battery life is so-so,more on the bad side though.
I have the 16 g iphone white and it is amazing! It has things that other phones cant do like the app store, actual web browser, movie-watching capabilities, awesome designs and the best music player out there!; It doesnt have MMS and stuff like that, but who cares? And that is easily cureable through software updates!
Apps, gps, email, size, clarity, internet access and the commitment to never ending software updates plus apps added daily to increase the value of the phone to me; Verizon is probably better than AT&#38;T most places, but AT&#38;T has served me just fine.
3G, flash storage, WiFi capable, touch screen, full qwerty keyboard, can use Itunes for media managment, App Store, Push Email, flush 3.5mm Headphone jack, decent camera; lack of 3G coverage (but not the phones fault), Firmware 2.0 has a couple bug but will be addressed by Apple in the near future for sure
Apps, easy to use, fast, reliable, speed, EVERYTHING!!!!!; Can't type in landscape while texing, MMS, copy and paste. Of course these CONS will be no more because of the new OS 3.0 apple will be coming out with.
Now att gives iphone owners unlimited free wifi access at ATT hotspots; I'm on it all the time so my battery needs to be charged but lets face it...this is the equivalent of a tiny laptop.
Touch screen really works, intutive, easy to use menu, and through iTunes it got better and better over time without having to move away from your PC / Mac. It has set new standards for the user, the industry...; Alarm clock does not function when the iPhone is off.
Has big visuals, easy functionals,conveneicent to carry, clear sound communications, very easy to learn to use things that are on the phone, quick recharge on the battery,; adjusting to the phone touching face while listening , finding out that some of the apps have to be downloaded to home computer 1st before you can download to iphone, not enough instruction with the phone,no docking station with phone
Powerful, easy-to-use operating system backs up a computer phone with thousands of applications. Beautiful screen and intuitive user interface make this a joy. Email syncs great with Windows XP. Camera is good. Maps with GEO Location outstanding. WOW; While not critical it would be nice to send photos with MMS. Emailing them is fine, however.
Easy syncing contacts, e-mails, bookmarks etc. Best surfing experience of any mobile phone. Well crafted text messaging system. Apps, apps and more apps daily!! Can do things with this phone that no other phone can do.; Could be a bit louder for noisy enviroments. Could add video capture, but this can be added with a software update!
i like that u can go on the internet and listen to music and call someone on one device.; i dont like that you can't send pictures and that when you get lots of apps on it it gets a lot slower.
I liked the touchscreen feature which is really sensitive, the sleek design, surfing internet on it, WiFi, it has also the got iPOD in it so music lovers, go for it. apps are cool.. one more is the UI of this thing.. jst luvd it; touch keyboard does not rotate while texting..
App store (limitless possibilities), simple customizable interface, and the best internet browser and music player available on a cell phone.; Lacks MMS(no picture messages), cramped keyboard(fast but ultimately uncomfortable), it's a fingerprint magnet, and rare reception issues. It also has no haptic feedback(which is less of a shortcoming and more of a luxury in some more recent phones).
Great form factor. Great ui. Great features and ability to add-on features through apps. durable. What it does, it does well. Strong support through Apple. AT&#38;T is strong in our area which used to be a Verizon stronghold.. Very few dropped calls, anywhere; Apps are sometimes buggy, and do not close properly. Mail can get hung up seeking a connection and drain batteries, if you are not careful. Safari crashes sometimes. very little trial software. Still bugs, but MUCH stronger than Windows moblie
Loads of apps, good quality camera, easy to use touch screen, user friendly touch screen keyboard and a great experience when surfing the web - what else do you want?; When the first iPhone 3G came out, the price point was ridiculous! The price has dropped dramatically now!
1. So fast and easy to use on the go.2. Great craftsmanship and form factor. 3.excellant apps and phone does everything even while driving.; Only one thing, the battery barely makes it through a whole day under heavy use, but what phone doesn't? Simply love my iPhone 3g!
Let's see, an app store that no phone can match, virtual keyboard, internet, IPOD and PHONE in one; Lacks some basic features but easily fixable with updates and camera is not bad but for the price could be better
Simple, easy to use interface. Also, the way that the iPhone manages contacts makes it dead simple when you switch to a new phone to get all your contacts on that phone; It is not really a problem with the phone as much as it is AT&#38;T, but service
Video playback is awesome! Great mobile media device. 3G is lightning fast. An incredible assortment of apps, sure some are so so, but developers are keeping the prices low, most of the apps I use and love are free!; Battery life and unable to send pictures in text messaging.
Multi-touch interface is the real money maker. It works like magic. Zoom in, pan around, press controls, it all just WORKS. Accelerometers make landscape/vertical mode seamless. 250 characters does not do justice to the virtues of this phone. It's a+; Battery life is drained quickly. A spare charger for mobile users is a MUST. Having a charger at the office and at home is a necessity as well.
itunes allows me to load movies, podcasts and apps. I have 50 apps on my phone and I look weekly for any new apps available. I have only maxed out my memory 1 time and that was due to itunes loading 3 full length movies, podcasts etc at one time.; Battery, .at least 3 times a day I have to fully charge the phone. I had to buy a car charger. The phone lacks a few basics. I bought my iPhone in Saudi Arabia and paid $1,068 USD
everything really. don't skimp out and get the 8gb version--$100 more for 8gb more is completely worth it, even if you think you'll never use those extra gbs.; battery life isn't great, kind of a fragile phone, easily scratches. a good case/screen protector is expensive and hard to put on perfectly. the iphone is a little quirky and will do weird things sometimes. expect this and reboot frequently.
It is super cool to get all the apps, and the phone works great. It fits in my purse nicely, and the company I work for, Natureday.com gave me the phone, but I only get 3 texts a day.; It slips out of your hands easily, the battery does not last very long, and you can't email any of your friends any pictures.
- Tons of apps to pick and choose from. - Lots of variety in available accessories. - Quick performance when opening most apps and browsing the intertubes; - I could type much faster with a physical keyboard, but I've gotten used to the touch screen.. - I get good 3G reception where I live (western CT), but as I've traveled the US, reception varies more than when I had Verizon phones.
The interface is great - but lacks customization.. GPS, Internet, Music, Movies, Streaming Radio, Photos, Apps... so much to like about this phone. Thing that you thought you wouldn't use, now become everyday functions.; Aside from the obvious misses from Apple like landscape keyboard on texting, or multimedia messaging, or video recorder, my one big gripe is that it lacks customization. Granted most of this can be fixed by jailbreaking your phone.
Best music player of any phone, Best web experience very similar to surfing on a computer, Exchange Support is great as well, GPS makes it possible to skip a seperate GPS, Apps keep things different and allow tons of functionality.; No turn by turn GPS Directions, have to follow a blue dot, No flash support for web browsing, No MMS on the phone,
I run a small business with 20 employees. This phone is truly incredible to use and to keep me connected. The GPS is awesome and accurate. The amount of applications available are staggering. If you want a flexible, useful phone this is it!; The camera is the only thing I think needs improvement. There should be a zoom features etc. However, I am told a third party app. is just about to change this. Just another reason the phone is so awesome. The applications are endless....
Better cell reception than Treo 650.. GPS is great! Especially avoiding heavy traffic as it marks those areas in red.. IPOD mode, Music (car stereo/3.5mm input jack) is perfect. Bluetooth head set ans. phone calls, music stops &#38; starts perfectly.; GPS &#38; other 3G web services eat up the battery fairly fast. Problem solved with purchase of a car charger. Some apps (apps store) not so important to me, but many (often free ones) become indispensable.. So much to explore, its great.
The apps are incredible. some are pointless, but some are usueful beyond imagination. google maps is incredible. internet on the go is unbelievable. Some apps just make the phone pay for itself such as: iconcertcal, ardvark, google maps, and much mor; easily breakable, but a good case with protect you. battery life is solid as long as you are responsible with use. if your on the 3g internet constantly youll have no battery. download the app battery magic. its a life saver.
Ease of use, responsiveness, a huge assortment of affordable programs, superior email access and readability, a great gaming machine, visually sharp display, fantastic internet exp and other attributes make this the best cell phone I have ever owned!; Because my phone synchronizes over 6,000 contacts without ever having to be physically connected to my computer, it can sometimes be slow on searches. But that is easy to manage by assigning east contact to a specific group.
1. A lot of storage! 16GB on a phone? That's ridiculous!. 2. It's beautiful. 3. Easy to navigate. 4. Call quality is actually pretty decent. 5. App store has some great apps!. 6. The best web browser on a phone.. 7. Standard headphone jack. 8. Outlook sync; 1. App Store also has a lot of worthless apps. 2. No MMS... but I never used it anyway.. 3. FRAGILE - This screen is made of glass, and will shatter if you drop it and it lands in a less than desirable way.
- I live in Toronto and the reception is perfect, I have no problems with the 3G Network.. - The applications are what makes this phone than the other phones out there.. - Email works perfectly, the keyboard is strange at first but you get used to it.; None that I can think of, maybe price.
-3G is great if you live in areas with good AT&#38;T reception. -iPod is just shy of perfect: no "view podcast notes" capability. -App Store/iTunes Store now accessible on 3G network, great variety of free apps and games. -Call quality &#38; GPS improved; -Takes a while to get used to touch keyboard. -Internet can be slow if in poor reception area. -GPS doesn't always work, isn't always accurate. -Screen gets scratched easily (buy a case and this shouldn't be a problem). -Like a computer, it can freeze
Love the design and cool factor. Best iPod for music and video ever. They don't lie you do get the internet in your pocket. Text and e-mail work great and the keyboard is easy and quick to use; Internet definitely would be better with flash. Lack of cut and paste is a pain. Sometimes with heavy web use the phone locks up
This phone has almost everything you could want in a phone. Sure, it would be nice to have copy/paste, and it would be nice if Apple allowed you to change the battery yourself, but, other than that, I have no complaints. App Store is great!; There really are no cons, outside of not being able to swap in a fresh battery. No copy/paste is not a big deal. I wish Apple would add it, so all of those who constantly swear they will take their lives if Apple doesn't include it, will shut up!
The unlocked version is great. Super cheap with t-mobile and the third party apps and the tzones hack. defeats purpose of 3g but you can use everything else. feels great in the hand, call quality is clear, and looks great. so many apps, too much fun,; too much fun, so many customizations i cant make up my mind, can get a little slow at times could use a bit more ram and needs better construction to make it less prone to screen breaking. rapair costs are huge! battery life is subpar
