Pros:. you have saved my tomtom. 
Cons:. none to say. 

$$;
Pros:. - Remote Control, Remote Control, Remote Control.. Rare in today's offerings. - Includes Europe data. - Excellent handsfree/phone operation. - Excellent quick release mount (rare). pre-connect Mic, Charger, antenna, and wire it all with a single action. 
Cons:. - outdated POI database.. can be overcome by connecting to the computer and updating.. - presumably more sensitive harddrive storage.. never failed on me.. 
Summary:. - This unit has some QUALITY features you would sense as soon as you handle it.. they simply don't make them this way anymore.. the high-quality, simple remote control is one of them.. beats me why they don't include these in any mainstream units today... - The most convenient feature is the quick release (HIGH QUALITY) mount they include.. I'll tell you, I have a current tomtom unity that comes with a FLIMSY mount.. it's ridiculous how they went DOWN on the quality of the mounts.. the 910 I used to have (until it was stolen from my car), had a mount the included a hookup for antenna (which improves reception hugely especially in urban settings), charger, and microphone for handsfree operation of the phone.. you get ALL THAT hooked up with the single action of putting the device on it.. on your way out of the car, you click it away and you're done.. I live in New York City.. this means, you don't leave ANY visible valuables in the car.. Now i have to look for the dam usb port and figure out it's orientation every time I get in the car with my carrent tomtom.. I don't understand how the reviewer called that beautiful mount FLIMSY.. it one of the highlights in this product... and by the way, online traffic updates and all the tomtom online features (weather, etc) work on this device, it's not outdated at all.. worked perfectly with my cell phone.. AND also downloaded my whole address book from my smart phone... ALL in the car.. and wirelessly on bluetooth.. this is like a dream compared to some of the current disappointing options you find in the market that claim to be more advanced!!!!!.

Pros:. IT HAS MORE THEN ENOUGH FEATURES THEN I NEED.. 
Cons:. MAYBE A BETTER MOUNT ,OTHER THEN THE WINDOW MOUNT.. 
Summary:. VERY EASY TO USE AND BETTER THEN WHEN I TRYED TO USE THE ON BOARD GPS,WHICH COULD NOT FIND THE STREET,AND I GOT THE STREET RIGHT AWAY USING THE TOM TOM 910.. 

$$;
Pros:. uper all in one sat nav . mp3 player +extras. 
Cons:. not found any. 
Summary:. congrats to tomtom for their go 910. 

$$;
Pros:. Very quick fix on satellites and stays linked even inside buildings. 20 gig hard drive with 11gigs free eliminates need for sd cards. Superb tech support by email or phone.Maps!. 
Cons:. None so far,. 
Summary:. Bought the Go910 despite many negative comments. Have put it to the test every which way and concluded that TomTom has ironed out the bugs it experienced at the outset. I also have a Garmin but find the the 910 with its feature set an incredible value. It has a very strong Itinerary menu where you can plan long multi-day trips in advance. I now have a GPS which I can use in America and in Europe by choosing a simple option in the preferences menu.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accuracy, speed, 20 gig mp3,. 
Cons:. alittle bulky but not a problem for me. 
Summary:. to start, i am in the air force stationed in germany so this is a european review, i am not commenting on the american maps even though i have the updates since i havent been back to the states to test it BUT PLEASE READ.... every one has knocked this system for mounts or poi's. i cant say that i have had a problem with my mount, i must assume this was a problem with the first release and corrected with the newer releases. i have had no issues with my mount. second the poi's, although they arent what i bought a gps for, i have downloaded software that easily gives me more poi's than i could ever dream of so i poi's are what your out for than this is a dream because it has 20 gigs of storage for more poi's than you could ever need. as for the navigation, its a the easiest thing. type the beginning of what you want and it finds it. any one who has been to europe understands that the roads here dont mention direction they just say the nearest city, so it makes travel extremely daughting. but with this i have no worries getting off at an exit with towns ive never heard of because every time its got me where i need to go. i bought this a month ago and taken two family trips over 300 miles away to some where ive never been and i got back to tell you how great this is. the directions are loud and in due time. the display shows you the exact turn if you are the slightest bit lost. as for screen in sunlight, its alittle tougher but it never got to where i couldnt see it. the music play back is great, the start up picture option allows you to put a picture to start your navigation the way you want. everything about this system is user customizable, from map colors to screen options to how you want to get to your destination. this is my first gps and im glad i went with it. this is something i regret not getting with i first got to europe instead of a few months before i leave. but now that i have it i will be sure to get more travel out of europe and really test this tom tom. as of now.... a perfect user friendly gps system. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, accurate, voices!!!. 
Cons:. None that I can think of.... 
Summary:. I recently had the chance of using the GO 910 and love this gps! First of all, I'm no tech genius but this device was a piece of cake to use. I borrowed it from a friend and was able to work it without any problems. Picking destinations and route planning is all self-explanatory. I love the text-to-speech while on the road, and the maps were perfectly accurate for me.. My friend didn't have it on his 910 but I know things like traffic updates and celebrity voices are available if you feel like tricking your device up a little. I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a new gps for their car.. 

$$;
Pros:. Chock full of features. Works exactly as described. Many accessories included.. 
Cons:. Slightly dim in bright sunlight, but readable.. 
Summary:. I normally do not do reviews, but after purchasing the Tom Tom 910 from Best Buy, and finding out there was a 15% restocking fee, I decided to read the reviews before opening. After reading many of the reviews on this site, I came close to returning it because of all the issues people were reporting. I eventually decided to take a chance and open the box and can not tell you how happy I am that I did.. After opening, the first thing I did was mount the winshield bracket. I applied it as instructed, and it stayed on solid (still there after 2 weeks). I connected the unit and the arm remained in place. Seems all you have to do is lock it, and many of the issues people have reported, go away. I love the MP3 player. I do not have the required audio connector on my car radio, but I do have a cassette adapter which works perfectly fine. I can play the music through he car stereo. My wife and I both have cell phones which were not on the compatible list, but they both work fine. When the phone rings, the MP3 player pauses.. The included remote allows me to change between screens, songs and phones without reaching over to the unit while driving. I could not be happier with the 910. It is a great device and performs above expectations.. Oh, and I guess this is important, it also does work extremely well as a GPS. I have put it to the test and it has proven to be accurate and very fast when recalculating routes. I've used DeLorme and it does not compare to the Tom Tom 910. They have also added an alternative mount kit (add'l purchase), which I noticed was a sticking point on some of the other reviews. Seems to me this company is litening to customer complaints. I have yet to experience any of the woes listed in any of the other reviews. Tom Tom must be listening.. 

$$;
Pros:. text to voice, mp3 player, easy to navigate menus. 
Cons:. more people aren't using them. 
Summary:. I just started using the tomtom go 910 a couple weeks ago having recently upgraded from the one and i already can say it is a very easy to use gps device with some great features like the text to voice and mp3 player - i just uploaded my music onto it last week. the menus are very clear like the ONE and makes driving to new places in the city where i live so much easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast route calculations, portable and easy to program. 
Cons:. Mounting bracket is poor and the screen is not very good in direct sunlight. 
Summary:. I travel for a living and must say this one out performed all of the others. I purchased the magellan 760 and the garmin. I was not to impressed with either. The magellan froze everytime I tried to alter the current trip. the garmin was inaccurate. The tomtom is very accurate and I must say that it was easy to use. I went to Italy in Oct and the major reason I purchased this was because it included the european maps, others charge over $200 for!!!! The one thing they don't tell you is how long it takes for it to get a signal. When we arrived it took about 2 hours for the unit to get a signal. Finally it did and it worked great. It was an invaluable in italy, as the road signs are dreadfull there. It did have few hangups as since they are doing alot of constructions on the highways the new roads were not on the maps. It was great in the cities because most european cities are not changing the streets because most of the streets cannot be altered as they are hundreds of years old. TomTom has a feature that lets you plug the route in for walking, most others do not. We used it as a walking guide pluggin all of the famous places we wanted to visit. Perfect, we wasted no time in seeing the city and were able to not get lost at all. I did bring a map as a back up and of course with anything always back your selfup by checking on a map that you are heading were you should be, because the only way it steers you wrong is if you input the address incorrectly. For the most part it was very accurate. One note, when you first get overseas it takes about and hour or so for the gps to calibrate with the satelites.. 

$$;
Pros:. great screen, not too busy, simple to use. 
Cons:. Price...but its worth the investment. 
Summary:. I've been reading the only problem is the mounting system which you can get a replacement on the website however if you place the mounting system on the lower part of you windsheild with the system resting on the dash board it dosent move and it's very stable and felt solid upon use. Being this is my first GPS it's very user friendly and its also mac compatible. I love it...... 

$$;
Pros:. full featured. 
Cons:. tricky to disengage from holder. 
Summary:. i upgraded from my pda version of tomtom to the 910. I had it installed into the car for me, so i can't comment on installation, but usage is great. BUT i can't use all the features on the mobile phone side due to it not being fully compatable with my samsung d-600, i.e. can't send text or download my phone book. I subscribed to the additional safety camera feature aswell. Directions are good, menus are a little layered oh and MAJOR TIP: volume on the speakerphone on the hands free side can only be increased while you are making a call using the remote control. nifty bit of kit - hope it doesn't get nicked though. TIP: leave your glove compartment open, it could save you a broken window. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Nice unit. 
Cons:. horrible suction cup for the windshield. 
Summary:. I bought this unit on June 10 for my trip to Western Europe and was very satisfied with the performance. I traveled 4 countries driving with this unit without a single issue with the Navigation Electronics or guidance. The only problem I had was with the suction cup for the windshield, the screen kept coming down slowly and the suction arm is not strong enough to hold it's light light weight. This unit is much better than the magellan unit or the garmin unit, in fact it is better than the unit that came in my Infiniti, Mercedes and Lexus, I think that car makers need to take a look at this unit and learn a lot from this unit and make it as close to this unit as possible.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can anyone tell me how to erase a saved/labeled address? I love everything about it except that. HELP!. 
Cons:. Not sure how to release saved information.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate, good graphics, bluetooth, route recalculation speed.. 
Cons:. POI, shape, startup time. 
Summary:. I would say I am very much satisfied with my Tom Tom 910.. ---- Pros ----. - Bluetooth :- The bluetooth voice quality and reception are very good. Its a useful feature given that in california from 2008 bluetooth or hands free are mandatory. As one user pointed it would have been better if they are voice dailing. But I guess its not a very imp feature.. - Accuracy :- I have been using it for 8 months now, and believe me there has not been a single incident, the GPS was off the mark.. - Graphics :- I like the graphics very much compared to other Garmin GPS. Its a subjective matter, but many would agree Tom Tom has better graphics.. - Ease to use.. ---- Cons ----. Shape :- I dont like the shape of the GPS. Its quite huge compared to Garmin products. Also they should have a way to charge the GPS directly without having to connect the charger to the mount.. StartUp Time :- One thing I noticed after gradually use, is that the GPS is taking more n more time to acquire satellites. Once it does acquire, its perfect. But sometimes it takes more than couple of minutes. But cant complain too much for it, cuz most of the top line GPS of other companies do same.. 

$$;
Pros:. Larger screen than most. Bluetooth. Comes with home and car charger. can play video with a small program from the web.. 
Cons:. The menus could be a little better laid out.. 
Summary:. I think this thing is great. It works and works great. It looks good. It handles blue tooth well. It boots fast. And the support is really nice.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use with many options. 
Cons:. Bulky and only a 4.0 screen compared to the XL. 
Summary:. I bought the 910 for my hubby after much research and a sudden price drop at my local electronic store. I loved it and found it easy to use right of the bat. He complained and asked me to return it for another cheaper model. I protested that the XL didnt have as many bells and whistles as the 910, but secretly I had found some glitches in the 910's mapping a couple of times (I'd never have admited that)... The XL went on sale and I got it...I loved it. bigger screen 4.3 &#38; I could stick it in my purse. No directional glitches this time. No mp3/much less POIs. IOnce sat outside a restaurant door the XL told me to drive 2.5 miles to reach it. Hubby wanted the 910 back...go figure. I obliged and even got it for $150 less than the original price (all this within 5 days) We are so so happy with the 910, finally. This model has not sent us on any 'obscure scenic tours' The voice direction is smooth and unobtrusive. The screen size is ok. Its remote control feature is great too. Ive never had a problem with the mounting. Its bulkiness is the only downside but I have begun to store it in an underseat storage area. Seems the 720 maybe the replacement for the 910 since its harder to find one in the stores. But for $349 it was a bargain.. 

$$;
Pros:. really quick sat.responce, can hear voice really good, and the new maps are right on target.. 
Cons:. the mount could be a little better.. 
Summary:. It has not gotten me lost at all and ireally like all the features. I own a garmin c330 and this tomtom is alot better to me.It would have gotten a 10 if it was not for the mount.. 

$$;
Pros:. Voices, MP3, Hardrive, Bluetooth, Ease-of-Use. 
Cons:. Hard to see in bright sun-light, mounting. 
Summary:. I've had this for a couple of days now and WOW does it work great. MP3's are easy to add with the software or in Explorer. It's loud enough to hear over my audio system, I sometimes use it as my stereo because of the 20 Gig Hardrive built in. I am going to have it wired to my car in a couple of days and I can't wait.. It's extremely easy to use, I've been overseas for three years and this is my first navi system and I have no problems figuring out how to use it. Touchscreen works like a champ and the many features are extremely awesome.. The bluetooth hooked up to my brand new LG VX8700 (out in June 07) with no problems. Haven't come across any points-of-interest that are not on the system, except for brand new stores which is to be expected. I prefer this over my borthers Garmin Nuvi 360 which was quite a bit more in price.. The only problems I have is that it is hard to see in bright sunlight and the mounting system doesn't hold the screen in place for a long ride. Clamping is easy and works well. Carrying case included pits snugly and inspires confidence. Easy to hook up to a computer for upgrades and extras.. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an all-in-one nav system. Forget the factory call nav systems and get this portable.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick and accurate. 
Cons:. Hard to see in the daytime. 
Summary:. Bought this Friday and the wife and I went to garage sales on Saturday morning after using the PC to set up all the stops. There were lots of turns and last minute "lets hit that one while we are at it." The TOMTOM Go 910 was always right on the money and gave quick and accurate new directions. Use of the itinerary features, which most of the other GPS's don't have, was a huge plus. And when we were finished, I tapped Navigate to and Home and it took us right back home. Easy to use and set up.. This particular 910 had the virus you've been reading about. When I backed up the 910 to my PC, it recognized the viruses and all I had to do was click on Heal. AFter the backup, I deleted all the foreign languages and pictures and music files that were on the 910's hard drive. I then loaded some of my mp3's and jpg's and those also worked great.. My only complaint is viewing the display during the daytime. Very hard to see. Some of it was due to the reflection of the dash. I had no problem with vibration or the dock not working. Seems they must have fixed this problem.. I would recommend this GPS to anyone who wants the extra features. The main one I was interested in was the Itinerary Planning so I could put in several stops on one trip and it would take to each one. Most GPS's don't have this features. Not sure I'll use the picture and music features too much but they are there just the same.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cold Start is very quick, GPS works great, MP3 is cool. 
Cons:. Bulky - Looks like a CRT. 
Summary:. I did a lot of research before buying this product. Bought it for $427 including tax, shipping &#38; handling. For the price it beats every product in the market.. Pros:. 1) Best Customer Service from TOMTOM.. 2) Got the Latest US map/POI for FREE.. 3) It comes loaded with US and Europe Map - WOW!. 4) 20 Gig Hard Drive - WOW.. 5) 16 Gig available for music, photos - WOW!. 6) Remote - WOW!. 7) Improved Mount  No more drooping problem as mentioned earlier.. 8) All accessories included.. 9) Text to Speech - WOW!. 10) Bottom line the GPS works GREAT!!!.. Cons:. 1) Bulky - Looks like a small CRT.. 2) To recharge at home you have to use the home dock to connect the power adaptor.. Even in the car, you have to use the mount to charge it.. The first time I used it from Orlando to Daytona Beach (one of the resort). Once I started driving - it gave me turn by turn direction till I reached my destination. I didn't have to look at the GPS system during by journey. Everything was Text to Speech direction. The only downside is that you can't carry this puppy in your pocket.. Otherwise it is the best so far.. 

$$;
Pros:. PORTABLE, ROBBUST AND EASY TO OPERATE. 
Cons:. CONNECTION OF TOM TOM TO CAR ADAPTOR. 
Summary:. I use Tom Tom 910 both in the USA and Europe.. It is more accurate and complete than the very expensive Navigation System installed on my Merc. in Italy and in Florida.. It has been used driving down from ND do FL and worked fine.. In other words Tom Tom 910 id does what it is suuposed to do. 

$$;
Pros:. Many advanced features not available in many brands at the same price. Allows many customizing options. Quick satellite pickup, Quick selection reponse. Itinerary planning.. 
Cons:. Suction mount is ok, would rather have a solid fixed mount I can install.. 
Summary:. I'm suprised to see as many low reviews as I have seen on this device. I spent months researching different brands. Everyone I talked with says stay away from Magellan (high failure rate) and go with Garmin. I like Garmin, but wanted a built-in hard drive, so my options were limited.. The TomTom GO 910 has this feature, and more. Way more than I can explain here, so go look at the list yourself on the TomTom website. Plus, the unit is presently available for $499, a far cry from the $800+ price tags on brands I have seen that have the same features.. Once you get your hands on this puppy, you will see exactly what I mean. Play with it for awhile and be amazed on what it can do.. I see reviews of people whining about the shortcomings on this device, such as out of date POI's, maps, etc. Almost every brand I looked at didn't have up-to-date POI's, so you update them yourself. I googled at least a few dozen sites that have downloadable updated POI's that you can install on this device yourself, as well as modify/add your own. Let's face it, if I owned any GPS company and released a updated POI database on a unit, tomorrow someone will be crying that some obscure chinese restaurant 2 blocks from thier house isn't on the list. Well boohoo, big friggin deal...cry me a river, ok? Most internet POI database sites allow one to include missing POI's and have them freely distributed to update the TomTom. Yes TomTom (and others) charge for future maps, POI's etc. But why not get it for free, it's already out there!?. Do yourself a favor. Do your research, compare the features on the 910 against ANY presently portable GPS and I'm sure you will come back with the same conclusions I have..

Pros:. Simple user interface, voice directions, accurate navigation. 
Cons:. A bit bulky, Cingular 8125 did not support dictation or reading of outgoing/incoming text messages. 
Summary:. TomTom GO 910, App 6.520, OS 1387, GPS v1.21, Boot 4.86. Unit includes fully installed Points of Interest (POIs) and maps for North America (US &#38; Canada) AND Europe  all preloaded on a 20GB hard drive (which may be issue if it gets dropped while walking around town  guess I will invest in a decent case with a lanyard.. I picked this unit up 02/25/07 for $500. The only other unit I was considering was the Garmin Nuvi 660  but at $800 for the unit with North American maps only ($300 more for Europe) I could not justify the price difference and went with the 910... Out of the box, with no prior experience on TomTom, I had this setup with a home location and a route from the store to home in under 5 minutes. The little tutorials were helpful but unnecessary as this unit has very simple menus and a very logical user interface.. Upon arriving at home, the toughest part was undocking the 910 from the window mount (as I had already forgotten the sequence used to dock it), this required me to pull the suction cup off the window then undock the unit. I paid attention this time and have been successful on all subsequent removal attempts (combo of upward lift/twist and hitting the eject button).. Bluetooth  pairing the GO 910 with my HTC (Cingular) 8125 went off without a hitch  which included setting up the pairing to act as a handsfree , importing all of my contacts, and setting up the GO 910 to use my data connect for plus services. All of this was accomplished easily by following the on screen prompts, again taking about 5 minutes. I now decided to tinker with swapping over to maps of Western Europe and updating the traffic service, these updates were quick. After updating, I could see all of the traffic incidents on the various freeways around LA (similar to Sigalert.com or Traffic411 with a TomTom flavor to the display). (Note  this is NOT the Traffic Alerts, which only works in UK and select other EU countries, same with safety cameras).. Once I decided to stop tinkering and go in the house, I promptly logged in and downloaded the TomTom Home application and installed it on my laptop (WinXP Pro SP2 running on a Dell XPS Gen 2). Windows recognized the unit upon install, (plugged in via the provided USB cable) but Windows hardware wizard was prompting me for a restart, so discretion being the better part of valor I capitulated. Windows had no issues connecting to the 910 and deciding it needed to be updated. I selected my updates and downloaded them. The 910 prompted me to backup my original config to ensure I could restore in the event something went amiss.. Upon further tinkering with viewing the map features, I started looking at Points of Interest (POIs) for cities I was familiar with. There were a few POIs for restaurants that had gone out of business, but only a few, and the errors were on par or better than I have experienced with Microsoft Streets &#38; Trips 2006 (my favorite computer based GPS navigation system).. To be fair, I am a bit of a geek and tend to be able to work most things with little to no reading of instructions. So to validate the ease of use (and provide a basic indoctrination for the most likely end user) I had my wife reprogram our route while on the freeway, (she was a passenger) to include a stop at a local retail store, she accomplished this in 30 seconds to a minute after having only observed me enter a reroute once.. To conclude, this is a great unit that is very easy to use, contains a rich feature set, and offers accurate door to door directions and POIs in North America and Europe.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slick touch screen interface; Clever automatic re-routing if you deviate from the calculated route.. 
Cons:. Display too dim in BRIGHT light.. 
Summary:. The editorial review was accurate at the time is was written. TomTom has listened to it's customers. A new mount was released to solve the drooping/sagging issue. The new mount was made available to existing owners for free - you had to go to the website and enter your serial number. The recent map release resolved many mapping errors and updated the POI database.. FWIW, the maps on ANY GPS unit will be out of date constantly, as new construction will always be ahead of map releases. The same will can be said of the POI database, as businesses, open/close/move constantly. FYI, TomTom doesn't make/edit/update the maps, they buy them from another company. You can go to TomTom's website and submit information pertaining to map errors. I did so, and in the newest release the error that I submitted was resolved. I don't know for certain if my submission was the reason the error was corrected, but it is good to know that you have the ability to point out errors and that there is the possibility that it will get corrected.. I find address entry just slightly awkward. TomTom asks for the city first, then the street, then number (address) on that street. While this isn't a big deal, it's not the way most people remember addresses (number, street, city, zip). But being a programmer, I understand why they do it this way - they are trying to validate the addresss during entry, so they can provide a list of valid possible choices.. The feature I find the most valuable, is TomTom's ability to recalculate the route on the fly, without any intervention. Say for example, you are driving on the freeway and there is a huge accident which blocks the road and you are forced off at an exit prior to the accident. No big deal, just keep driving, TomTom will recognize that you've changed directions and recalculate the route automatically! No panicking children or spouse, no frantic scambling for a map, or having to pull over to "ask for directions.".

Pros:. Pre-loaded maps of North America, Europe. Re-routes very quickly, easy to use. Great reception. Great interface to plan routes on your computer.. 
Cons:. A little bulky, heavy.. 
Summary:. Great product. I have had no issues with the mounting device. Since I live in Europe for 5 more months, it is great to have Europe and North America and not have to change memory cards; all maps are stored on its 20 GB hard drive. Over all I love this product..

$$;
Pros:. Versatile, accurate. 
Cons:. Inferior mounting system. 
Summary:. I bought the 910 because it included Hungary, and I was about to travel there. I was astonished at how accurate and up-to-date it was. Now back in the US, I find the same things to be true. It is far superior to the built-in systems I have had in a Honda, Infiniti, or Chrysler - and easier to update. The ipod and cell phone interface, etc. are just gravy, but tasty additions. My phone, a PPC6700, is not listed as supported, but it works fine. Contrary to some other reviews I have read here, my unit came packed extremely well, is very accurate (that is not to say perfect - just better than my built-ins), intuitive, and amazingly versatile. I cannot compare it to other brands, but it is hard to believe that they could be much better. I am buying a new car and leaving the navigation system out because the 910 is just too good. Planning to get one for my wife. She usually hates these "toys," but 5 minutes with mine and she was sold.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, big screen, text to speech. 
Cons:. Nothing particularly major. 
Summary:. I was one of those people who was always very against the idea of GPS, until I tried a TomTom out, and loved it. It's very easy to use, and user friendly right out of the box, and I love to rec TomToms to people who are wary of techie type items in general, because, well, that was me, too, and I was wrong.. I am especially a fan of the text to speech capability on the 910, as I am a bad judge of distance visually, so sometimes telling me "turn right in 300 yards" doesn't mean much to me. This one will just tell me "turn right on Main Street" instead.And the unit comes with loads of other cool features as well; I think the iPod connectivity should also be nifty. I think it's worth it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great battery life, slide show photos, MP3 music, iPod connection and many more..... 
Cons:. Cheap quality windshield mount.. 
Summary:. I just got this 2weeks ago, from an Internet store. I tell you, this GPS is amazing. When I first opened the box, they said, an egg crate like padding supported it. It's not. The unit was well packed that even if it falls it will not move or shake. When I turned the unit has the latest version (ver. 6.1) even before I update it. The first sets of Tom tom GO 910 unit had a lot of problem. I test it in NY, NJ &#38; CT, even in Toronto, Canada. It brought me from my current location to the front door of my destination. This GPS is just amazing. Also, I have tried all the other features such as Photo slide shows (they're good for long trips) and MP3 (alternate MP3 Player if you don't have one in the car). This unit has 20GB of storage. Only 11GB left with all the preloaded maps in it (still a lot of space for photos &#38; mp3's). The bluetooth feature is great as well. My Motorola V3 is connected to it. It reads out the text message to you so you don't have to read it on you phone. POI also has the phone numbers if you want to make reservations on restaurants, hotels or anything you want. The phone numbers of POI will only show up if your phone is connected to the unit. The speaker is loud and clear. I use the external mic to talk that came with it for better quality. Battery life is good; I took almost 4 1/2 hours before I charged it again in my car. The screen size is decent, very nice &#38; clear. I put a screen protector to avoid scratches.. The only thing I don't like with this unit is the windshield mount it came with. After 1 week of use the windshield mount broke and after few bumps on the road the unit gets loose on the mount.. Customer service is good &#38; fast. I was told they will sent out a new windshield mount replacement right away. Called me back the next MORNING to let me know that they have shipped the windshield mount replacement. That was pretty cool.. If you're looking for a Nav System whether it's for long driving or around town, I recommend this one. Very user friendly on the road and/or when docked on the computer. Thanks, I hope this opinion helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Extensive additional features which are not offered on many models, robust bluetooth support, many customizable features. 
Cons:. US support for some of the advanced features is slow to market, but new acessories are arriving each day. 
Summary:. I spent many days and nght researching &#38; reviewing AIO (All in One) GPS units prior to my purchase, and when I deceided on the Tomtom Go 910, I made the right choice.. I initially purchased the unit for a cross-country road trip, but began using it a month prior to get farmiliar with the unti.... it took about 15 minutes to setup, change my preferences, and begin navigating to a Wendy's near my place of work.. Once the unit has been setup, the GPS signals lock quickly, and always seem to hold a good signal.. I was one of the luck ones that bought the unit after they modified the mounting bracket; which seems to be sturdier that described by many.. Downsides: map data seems to be very accurate, but .... I have noticed a couple of the POI's are off.. Upside: Many, the built in 20GB HD is a huge +, I have loaded Audiobooks for the kids, and it has saved my patients many times. Not only has the unit been fun to use, but it also has help save time and frustration on the road.. 

$$;
Pros:. Every thing works as advertized. and is Mac compatable. 
Cons:. Window mount does not keep Tomtom fixed on rough roads and Tech support is useless. 
Summary:. Like many of you I too was waiting too long for this GPS, and paid too much for it. But I'm glad I did. Long time ago I had a HP Jornada with a GPS card and used it to go everywhere. The problem with that device was it took too long to lock in a signal. Not my Tomtom 910. It locked sync just fine. I've had it for about a week and a half, and I love it. I live in the hills of Oakland and when I first turn it on it takes longer to lock on a signal then if I was in the flats and just turned it on but the wait time is never more then a block. I also notice signal lock issues in down town San Francisco, but still far better then my previous GPS device. Any Interference from building is soon overcome and ready to navigate.. Like with any directions weather it be from MapQuest or Yahoo be aware of your road signs. I did have it try to send me down a one-way street the wrong way. So it is not perfect, but it did reroute me once I took a different road. Quite quickly too.. I have Cingular wireless and a Motorola V557 Phone. I have gotten my phone to work with hands free but it did take 3 tries. I also just now got my Plus services working but had loads of trouble. I called Tech support about connecting it and the gentleman was by far the worst tech support agent that I have ever dealt with. I know more about the device then he did. I was told that my phone was not supported. I informed him that it was listed in the menus of the Tomtom 910 and I had it working for hands free. I felt like he just wanted to give me any answer that would get me off the phone quickly. From my web surfing I had already found a similar interaction with Tomtom Tech support at http://www.mobilityguru.com/2006/06/05/can_tomtom_part_ii/page3.html I also found the answer on how to fix it there too. Why couldn't Tomtom tech support give me the same advice? In there favor the tech agent did handle my second issue with speed. My window mount keeps lowering the angle of the Tomtom as I drive. This happens quicker with rougher roads. I did my homework and already knew about double clicking the mount but that still did not work. From reading up on the Tomtom 910 I know the Mount was a weak point on this device. He is sending out a new one.. One tip for any one concerned about all the mentions of it being hard to remove from the mount, don't be. It is real easy as long as you do it right. As you push the release button on the front frame, Push the device backwards towards the windshield and lift out. It may be a little counter intuitive but it works like a charm.. For all you Mac users this works great with my PowerBook G4 Mac. I have used the "home" software to load my pictures on with out a problem.. My Music is another issue. Since I use iTunes like most of the free world I could not get my music down loaded. I believe it has to do with the security features in iTunes music. If all my music was MP3 I think it would not be an issue.. (If any one has a work around or knows more than I do Please Reply and let me know.). All in all I would definitely recommend it to any one looking for GPS. Just know what its limitations are before hand check to see if your phone is supported (because these are some of the coolest features of the Tomtom) and put down the small fortune for this device, and never get lost again!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, speech is nice, fast recalculation of route. 
Cons:. Mac software needs work, wife will want one too. 
Summary:. How did I ever live without this? I have to travel to at least one new place just about every day for my job and I used to print out maps and take them in the car. Needless to say it wasn't exactly safe to try and drive and look at the directions and if I missed a turn it could really foul things up.. Enter the TomTom Go 910. My wife got it for me and it's the best present I've ever received. Sorry honey, the trip was great but this has taken sooo much stress out of my work day. I just type the address right on the screen and away I go. Even if I miss a turn because I couldn't get through traffic in time it just recalculates the directions for me. No more trying to figure out how to get back to where I was!. The voices that speak the directions are all pretty good but I went with Dave since he sounds the most natural to me. It's nice to have the map you can look at but also have the voice prompts as well.. The car mount is pretty slick. You just turn a dial and the device sucks to the windshield. Once you get it in the position you want you turn it again and then it stays put.. I can't say much about the phone features or the mp3 stuff because I really just use this for getting to new places and boy does it ever work great for that. The only real problems I've had is when I'm in between very tall buildings on pretty narrow streets. The 910 will either lose the signal or start hopping around. Fortunately it's quick to get back on track once you get a bit more daylight and there aren't too many places where you can barely see the sky where I drive.. I'll probably end up getting another one for my wife just because now that she's seen it work she thinks she needs one of her own. All in all it's a great unit and I'm very pleased with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. incredibly intuitive, has clear graphics, reasonable reception in Manhattan (no GPS is great with tall buildings). 
Cons:. Can't turn it on!? Or can I.... 
Summary:. It's not dead, just do a soft reset! Use a pin and hold the soft reset button for 5-10 seconds (the reset is not on the face, but in the hole at back where the unit connects to the base; opposite side of the gold circle, up just a little from the green strip). Apparently the battery shuts down if it's overcharged, so if you charge it for more than a few hours it might not turn back on again. Reset it and you'll be on the road again!. 

$$;
Pros:. Best software there is, extremely easy to use, excellent text to speech. 
Cons:. Power can't connect directly to the unit, must use car mount or home dock. 
Summary:. I'm a former Garmin Nuvi user who borrowed a TomTom from a friend. Once I used the TomTom I realized just how much was missing from the Nuvi. If I never used the TomTom I'm sure I would have kept the Nuvi but I just found myself being frustrated by all the things I couldn't do once I went back to the Garmin. As soon as the 910 came out I sold the Nuvi and I'm so glad I did. I love how you can customize so many aspects of the 910 to your liking. The 910 powers up very quickly and obtains a satellite lock very fast. From what I understand, this is without the QuickFix feature which should be available soon so I guess that will make it even faster. If I turn it on after it's been off for only an hour or so it's usually able to get a lock immediately.. Entering addresses is super easy. Just tap on the on screen keyboard and it will auto fill based on what you've typed in so far. You can also navigate directly to GPS coordinates if you want. Driving when surrounded by tall buildings is pretty good although it may think it needs to recalculate your route if you stop. Once you get moving again it locks back to your road and you're on your way. Reception is definitely better than any previous TomTom models.. Text to speech is very good overall. After trying all the voices I have to say that Dave is the most natural sounding of them all. There are some video samples available on the web if you search for it that give you an idea of what to expect. There are some issues with some of the pronunciation but for the most part it's a fantastic addition that really helps you get to your destination. I think it's worth the extra money. If you miss a turn or if there is a mapping error or a road is closed, the unit reroutes you within seconds so it's no big deal. Even my mom who has never used a car GPS before loved it when she took it on her trip to California. Now it looks like she's going to buy one for herself.. I think the biggest complaint that I've seen with other web reviews is with the POI database but each time I've used it to find a bar, gas station, store etc. it's been right on the money. Sometimes the location of an address may be off by about 50 yards or so and this usually happens on roads that twist and turn all over. On straight roads laid out in a grid it's dead on. An arrow points out what side of the street your address is located on which is nice. I like the advance planning and itinerary features which come in handy for longer trips away from home. The screen is easy enough to see even in direct sunlight although if you have a white shirt on it will reflect much more than darker colors. The battery seems to last for about five hours based on some testing I've done. I never leave home without it and wouldn't dream of going back to paper print outs. There is nothing better on the market today.. 

$$;
Pros:. Feature packed, fully customizable. 
Cons:. Would like to see more cell phones supported as well as carriers.. 
Summary:. I was very impressed with the 910 after viewing it on tomtom.com. I have toyed with the unit for 5 days now and have gotten pretty familiar with it and I recommend that anyone that purchases this unit be fair and get familiar with it before posting a review. I've read some post stating that POI's did not have phone numbers. Not true, there are 2 ways of getting the phone number, (1) Click on "Browse Map" and click on a POI and you will see the name and phone number, (2) Click on "Mobile Phone" then "Call" then "POI" then select you POI and it will automatically be called for you. If you actually need the number just go to recent calls and it will be displayed there. I'm not sure what all the trouble with the mount is about. I think a lot of the complaints about the mount is user error, they must NOT be placing the mount in the "locked" position. There are 3 positions for the mount, Lock, Adjust and Remove. Look closely at the mount and you will see an icon of a padlock. Align this with the "dot" and it will not move. Also I have read that people are having a hard time removing the 910 from the mount. Simply press the button on the center, front and top and swing it up. Use 2 hands it works smoother, same when remounting to the dock. The unit works very well AFTER you get familiar with it. It does a lot of stuff so there are many layers of menus to discover. My biggest beef is the lack of cell phone a carriers support. I have Verizon and a LG VX9800. The phone links to the 910 with no problem. When the phone rings simply tap the phone icon on the screen and start talking, tap it again to hang up. I really like the feature that when I walk away from the 910 Bluetooth is disconnected automatically and when I get back to the 910 I do not have to connect it, it is done automatically. I have wireless data on my cell, but it is not supported at least at the time of this posting. I knew this before I purchased the unit, because it is stated on tomtom.com which phones are supported and what features are supported. Below is my experience with mounting to a motorcycle.. I purchased the 910 for a motorcycle. No way was I going to trust ANY windshield mount without tethering the unit for security. I have a 2003 Gold Wing and it has a dash so I permanantly glued the mount to the dash with Silicone II. This stuff will adhere to rubber and plastic. I let it set up for 24 hours and it seems very stuck on my dash. I did place the mount on one of my mirrors just to test suction and was very impressed. My warning to anyone that is planning on mounting this to a bike is the secure the mount with glue or at least some sort of tether just in case. Also I plugged the 910 into my auxilary input on my stereo and the voice is played over 4 speakers, very loud and crystal clear. MP3's play as well. I rode around today at noonish and was always able to read the display, although it can get a bit washed out, I can always here the voice guidance.. Also another thing that the 910 did was to tell me which lane to be in for my upcoming turn. Makes it nice when there are 3 or 4 lanes to plan ahead.. Overall this is a great unit with a whole lot of features. Don't hesitate to buy one especially if it can be returned.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use with many functions. 
Cons:. Accessories are not yet available; speakerphone is quiet; expensive.. 
Summary:. I have been very impressed with the Go 910. The first week I had the 910, I drove across the USA from KY to WA. Everywhere I went, the 910 knew where I was and had correct road and POI information. I travelled through small towns and big cities, used back roads and major highways. When I took spontaneous turns, it was able to quickly and effortlessly calculate new (good) routes.. Programming destinations is simple whether you have an address, city, zip code, or other information. When I was heading to a hotel and put in the hotel's address, the 910 displayed the hotel's information because it automatically matched up its POI database with the address database.. Syncing to my cell phone was easy and quick via bluetooth. It not only accessed the calling options, but was also able to integrate my phonebook into the touchscreen display. Answering and hanging up on calls is very easy. Hearing the other party, though was not as easy. The speaker on the 910 is strong enough to hear the voice-guided directions (i.e., "turn left on Pear St"), but it was difficult to hear what people were saying when they were on the speakerphone. In the long-term, I would like to install this to play through the car stereo, so that should be better...and, yes, I did have the phone volume as far up as I could.. I was able to see the screen well even in the sunlight. Undocking the 910 is a little difficult, but is manageable. The car dock I had stopped providing a charge to the unit after 2 weeks of use, but Best Buy did not hesitate to give me a completely new unit. I had a better experience than another reviewer, in that each of the units were well packed from the manufactuerer and operated perfectly right out of the box.. When accessories are released for this, I will quickly buy the ipod connector, which is advertised as providing a data and power link through the docking port on the ipod. With the easy-to-read color touchscreen on the 910, this should be the BEST available in-car solution for the ipod. Stereo minijack audio inputs and outputs allow this to be a good solution for listening to other audio devices in the car. Additionally, there are at least 10GB of internal memory (more if you delete maps for other conitenents) on which you can store music, audiobooks, or photos. The photo viewer is pretty nice with options for zooming far into photos or creating slideshows. You can also program the startup photo to be anything you want.. In short, this is the coolest gadget I've gotten in a long time. It functions well, and is currently only held back by the availability of accessories.. 

$$;
Pros:. Full featured POIs, Large screen, Route change on the fly. 
Cons:. Some minor map errors, windshield mount the pits.. 
Summary:. Call me !!!STUPID!!!. I asked TomTom if they had an adapter to mount the TomTom GO 910 to my motorcycle -- similar to their RIDER model. They told me no and referred me to their RIDER model. Unfortunately the RIDER model does not have the features the 910 has. Well, not to be deterred, I checked to see if the windshield mount would work on my motorcycle's windshield. It appeared to be good and tight so off I went. I did not get more than 100 feet on the highway before the entire mount and TomTom Go 910 went flying off the motorcycle and bounced along the asphalt highway. Though pretty scratched up and a slight chip in the view screen, the unit works perfectly -- this is the unit with the internal hard drive. When TomTom gets their screen frame replacements on the market I'll buy one and then you'll hardly notice the damages.. TomTom -- please come up with an alternative to that freaking windshield mount.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has newer streets and is easy to use. 
Cons:. Mounting needs work, who uses county road numbers?. 
Summary:. After having read most of the reviews on this site, I felt the 910 was the way to go. Just to be safe though, I dropped the extra $100 for BestBuy's 4 year extended warranty; $25/year for extra insurance is a good buy! (My company charges 10-13%/year...just do the math.). After I got in my van, I quickly opened the box and hit the power button. It seems like the POST takes a while, but once it came up, I followed the menus, which included setting the language and time.. TomTom quickly acquired my current location and then I started typing in my address. This is what impressed me most...my house is "new construction" that was built in 2004. Most of the mainstream packages DON'T have my street even listed. Google Earth has my street, but the satillite picture still shows a swamp!. Anyway, after it had the route planned, it took me a minute to figure out how to get the 910 on the windshield mount. However, I was amazed at how easily the device stuck to the glass and how stable it was on the way home; even over the pothole-buckled freeways of Upstate New York.. I was also impressed with the power adapter's positve lock into the power port and the external blade fuse.. TomTom determined my route home and quickly redirected, whenever I deviated from it's route. The screen was easy to see and even with my XM radio turned up, I only needed the volume set to 70% to hear the instructions.. I also got to experience the great feature that lets you know when you're exceeding the legal speed limit, but it only worked on one of the freeways I was on. However, I'm not sure how to turn this one off, and considering I like to go 15-20 over the posted limit, on freeways, the blinking red numbers may get annoying on long trips.. After I arrived home, I did have trouble getting the 910 to disconnect from the windshield mount. I had kinda expected this, but I also think that a little time will help me with this.. After the kids were in bed, I pulled out my laptop and loaded up the TomTom Home software. Now...the CD starts the installer, which then says there's an updated version available, so I go for it. Then after that version is downloaded and running, it says that there is an even newer version...what's up with this??? But wait...there's more...even after the third version had installed, a fourth update was found and installed. But, finally, I got the software running. Again the 910 was a bit reluctant to attach to the USB base, but once I got it hooked up, the unit was easily discovered and started working.. The software takes a little bit of time to get used to, but over all it's pretty good.. I especially like the Backup feature. So before I start deleting files I don't need from the 910, I'll make a backup.. Though it's neat how they include the plastic card for registering, the process on the website was not very intuitive. But I got through, even though my free traffic subscription is for the Netherlands???. And, don't forget to activate the special bonus voice while you're on the web.. Once I had logged into my account from the TomTom Home software, downloading and installing new voices, services, etc. is very, very easy. They got this right.. Even planning routes on my computer was easy.. Two other items I'm not crazy about are the remote and how the computer voices read the street names.. The remote, while handy, doesn't really have clear markings. Just like the mounting, experience will improve with time.. As for the street names, instead of using the "common" name, the 910 uses the road number for county and state roads. (FYI...using a human voice resolves this, since those voices don't read street names.). Overall, I'm excited about this gadget. I'll be taking TomTom on a road trip over the Memorial Day weekend. Afterwards, I'll post my feelings about the unit after it has had a good workout.. In closing let me offer a few good suggestions:. 1. Get the extended warranty!!! (No I don't work for BestBuy!). 2. Get a better carrying case to protect the unit and the accessories. (e.g. medium camera case). 3. Connect the 910 to the computer every few days, to keep the satillite positions and software up-to-date.. 4. Have fun and enjoy your TomTom!. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive, accurate and fast. Full of features. Big hard drive and long battery life.. 
Cons:. A bit pricey. No voice-activated calling using Bluetooth. Only suction mount available.. 
Summary:. I purchased my TomTom Go 910 at BestBuy before general release, expecting to see a few bugs. And indeed, the first unit I bought met those expectations. The windshield mount, which provides power to the unit through a cigar lighter adapter, did not fit the base of the unit securely. The bottom line was a poor connection and a unit that shut itself down on a frequent basis.. I walked the defective unit across the parking lot and exchanged it for a second one. This one, we tested in the store before I left. Everything checked out, and I walked quickly from the store and eagerly installed it in my car. This one powered up immediately.. The TomTom Go 910 is an intuitive and easy unit to set up and use. Its quick to boot and the new GPS chip is quick to lock on a position. I paired my Verizon Motorola E815 phone with the unit and imported the phone book. It worked flawlessly and the quality of the speaker phone is very good. I let the unit take me home pulling off the road a couple of times to change to a different language just for fun. The voices are natural and even the text-to-speech was pleasing to listen to (although it kind of butchered the street name, Via De La Escuela&Im in California).. Upon arrival at my house, I installed the TomTom Home software on my computer and hooked the unit up via the USB connector on the included home dock. I easily loaded several megabytes of MP3 files and photos to the 20 GB hard drive. All worked very well. Then I finally got around to reading the manual.. In fact the only bug I encountered was in the Home software itself, which at one point generated one of those annoying memory cant be read error messages that are fairly common in Windows. I submitted a tech support request to TomTom, and although they havent resolved the issue yet, they did reply to my email within minutes, letting me know they are working on it.. All in all, Im very happy with my purchase. Im planning a trip to Europe in the near future. Im anxious to test the maps. Maybe Ill even let my 910 speak German to me.. 

$$;
Pros:. All maps pre-uploaded. 
Cons:. There are none. 
Summary:. I just bought the last TomTom GO 910 and have nothing but a great experience with it since I pulled it out of the box. Now, I'm wondering how I ever got anywhere without it.. 

$$;
Pros:. What can I say, it does everythig it says it would. 
Cons:. I couldn't connect it to my computer so I have to exchange it. 
Summary:. This product is great, picked it up at Best Buy on April 17. Worked right away, I have no idea how the previous guy says he couldn't find the language when the first thing is does is ask you what language you want to pick. I was using it in less than 10 minutes, the suction mount is great and the 910 clicks in a snap, to get it out you push the middle button and comes right off. As for navigation it works great, I put my home address in and took me home with no issues. I set up bluetooth with my phone and it works great, it transfered my phonebook to the 910 and I could make calls in no time. So everything worked as advertised as the unit goes, my only issue I couldn't get it set up with my computer and have to exchange it, my computer wouldn't recognize it and tried 2 other computers and the same thing. So I am really happy with this product for the features it has and how easy it is to use.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has European maps preloaded, as well as Text to speech, and a 20 G Hard Drive.. 
Cons:. Wish it was thinner and had an FM antenna built in rather than blue tooth.. 
Summary:. This is a great unit for the price. Easy to use and the ability to pre-program an itinerary and store multiple itineraries on the Huge hard drive is a major plus. The Mp3 works great and if you have documents to take with you for show and tell, you just print screen and turn it into a JPG and display it in a slideshow. Has an awesome zoom. The free traffic is nice but I wish it was through the FM antenna rather than the blue tooth and internet of my phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good directions. 
Cons:. Basically no manual. 
Summary:. I have not used any other car-based GPS, so I don't know how this compares to other units.. That said, I like it very much, and think it is well worth the $500 it cost me (at Nerds.com). I chose it because it comes preloaded with Europe as well as the US (I got disastrously lost in Barcelona on vacation last summer - with printed directions, once you miss a turn, it is impossible to recover).. It is easy to use (which is good, because the "manual" is so short as to be useless - both the printed one and the one on the CD.. This means you have to do some experimenting). and gives excellent directions - along the lines of. "Continue straight for 2 miles, then you will turn right....Right turn in 250 yards ... turn right" You get timely warnings, so it is easy to follow.. I have a few minor gripes, but they are petty compared to the device's virtues.. - The power cord slips out easily, instead of being firmly attached. - The windshield mount sticks very well to the windscreen (once you realise you have to rotate it): I was skeptical, expecting it to come off like a child's toy. However, the swivel is not rigid enough, so the device can bend down an may need propping up.. - Why does everything with a hard-disk have to load photos and music? It seems to me a stupid feature to be able to add photos and music to a navigation system , and unneccessarily adds to the expense and complexity.. - They should hire someone to write a manual. It took me a week to figure out that to see roads in Europe, I had to choose the option "Switch maps". Okay, pretty obvious in hindsight, but would it kill them to have a sentence about it?. 

$$;
Pros:. Huge screen, ease of use, accuracy, bluetooth phone, price. 
Cons:. No back buttons when going through menus, bluetooth mic is sort of muffled. 
Summary:. TomTom must have shipped updated units because my 910 works fine. I have no problems with the mount dropping whatsoever, no freezing, no connection issues, no missing streets so far, and no problems with the POI's in the unit. I bought my unit and immediately installed the TomTom Home software and updated it. I'm a long time Garmin GPS V user and I have used other Garmin C series GPS's, and this blows everything out of the water. I just with it had full support for either my Blackberry 8700g or Samsung SCH-A930. I can only make and recieve calls with either phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works as described. 
Cons:. Bad window mount, documentation could have been better. 
Summary:. Works great. Hooked up to my computer and phone with a couple tries, give yourself sometime in the driveway to do the setup, not on the way home. Documentation could have been better, but with a product that can be used in Western Europe and North America, it had to be written that way. Glad I got it.... Make sure to bump up your cell phone plan use up more internet if you plan on using the traffic portion.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, Bluetooth and iPod interface. 
Cons:. The mount, bluetooth support. 
Summary:. Once you master the mount (go to the website instead of the inclosed install poster) there's very little not to like about the TomTom. The Bluetooth phone isn't full featured for all phones (check the website). My LG phone wasn't listed but it definitely works although I can't download the phonebook from my cell phone. I had to go to Tiger.com to get the iPod cable. The interface is easy to use. It picks very good routes and I like the information display. The mount probably works well for most cars but my Mini Cooper has a taut suspention, bumps can cause the mount to come loose cause the TomTom to drift down. The audio output is very good and there are many options. Anyway the TomTom had all the features I was looking for and it works very well for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. it navigates ;). 
Cons:. price a bit high. 
Summary:. I still use tomtom version 5 on my pda and am thinking about buying the 910. It costs 700� here and is a bit expensive for what you get. 

$$;
Pros:. PACKED WITH FEATURES. 
Cons:. OUTDATED POI DATA BASE. 
Summary:. There are no GPS units made that are. completely accurate all the time.. People who give this unit a bad or negative. rating probably do not fully understand. the GPS units full capability.. Being able to update the GPS unit from the. TomTom Software is a feature that many. cheaper GPS units lack.... The GPS unit is fast, accurate, and has a beautiful full color LCD screen.. This model is packed with more features. then most GPS units selling for a $ 1000.00.. 

$$;
Pros:. Phenomenal GPS reception: The SiRF III based TomTom GO 910s GPS receiver performs so well, it puts all other GPS to shame. I was even able to receive 3 out of 5 bars indoors.. 
Cons:. Poor mounting hardware, terrible customer support. 
Summary:. I have posted a more detailed review at www.gpsmagazine.com. Below is an excerp from that review:. TomToms 910 is an excellent GPS unit that performs better than any of its current competitors. Its all the more frustrating, therefore, that TomTom shoots itself in the foot with the details like inadequate support, poor mounting hardware, and buggy firmware releases.. These kinds of issues show TomTom as the new kid on the GPS block. They have a potentially superior product, but need to get a few kinks ironed out. Once these issues are worked out, theres very little wrong with the 910.. Even with its current issues, were still giving the 910 the Editors Choice award. If youre looking for an excellent, easy to use, GPS unit for your, youd be hard pressed to do better than the TomTom GO 910.. 

$$;
Pros:. Tons of storage with big feature set, beautiful screen, and easy to use.. 
Cons:. Mount is difficult to reach because it is so short (I mount it low on the windshield so that it sits on the dash). It would be nice if it could extend. 
Summary:. Now if they could only incorporate satellite radio I could reduce my gadget load to one device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use; rerouting is quick; large screen. 
Cons:. Windshield mount to the unit; reliability out of the box. 
Summary:. The first unit I purchased was defective out of the box. It all started out with it having a hard time picking up the initial gps signal. The manual said to wait 5 minutes. I waited for 35 minutes before it finally picked up a signal. That was after powering it off and then on after the initial 10 minutes in an area with no obstructions. Throughout an hour of being on, it constantly shut itself off periodically multiple times.. 

$$;
Pros:. Unit works fine. 
Cons:. Mount should be recalled... 
Summary:. The plastic suction cup broke on two mounts within 5 months. Tom tom will not replace under warantee and states the mount is made by an outside vendor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth works; 20GB built in is nice. 
Cons:. Damn hard to read in sunlight. 
Summary:. It is amazing that TomTom can come up with a product that rivals Garmin and in some cases exceeds it $ for feature but they still cannot get the darn device readable from anywhere that is not mostly cloudy all the time!. 

$$;
Pros:. zip code address identification and itinerary planning. 
Cons:. minor routing issues. 
Summary:. The TomTom Go 910 has worked nearly flawlessly. I've noticed a couple minor issues with routing, most likely due to the map database:. 1. told me to take a street that wasn't really a street. 2. took me 1 block out of the way returning home because (I think) it didn't recognize an off ramp as a valid way to turn at an intersection that states "no turns". 3. verbal commands to exit U.S. 422E to U.S. 202N were incorrect, but the map display was correct. If you listened to the verbal commands, you would have been in the right lane instead of the left as you needed to be.. I haven't noticed many issues like this, but I'd suggest using the demo feature to run through the trip in advance to avoid problems during the trip.. I've had no problems with the mounting device. My guess is that people may not be fully locking the arm. You need to turn it to the first click to mount it to the window and then to the second click to hold the arm in place. I've also had no problems with TomTom Home and connecting the device to my computer. I've downloaded the latest maps and POIs without any issue.. I did discover one annoying and slightly alarming issue when I first attached the device to my computer. I found that the host.exe and copy.exe files are infected with the Perlovga.A virus. I contacted customer service via email and received a response within 2 days. In their response they stated that "a small, isolated number of TomTom GO 910's, produced between September and November 2006, may be infected with a virus. The virus is qualified as low risk and can be removed safely with virus scanning software. Appropriate actions have been taken to make sure this is prevented from happening again in the future." My antivirus software removed the virus without any issues.. I compared this unit with the Garmin Nuvi 350. While both units are comparable, I chose the TomTom because I was able to enter addresses via zip code, which the Nuvi 350 cannot due (dispite what the user manual I downloaded from Garmin's web site states). Also, the TomTom has an itinerary planning mode not found on the Nuvi.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast route recalculation. Clear Voice. Decent Maps. 
Cons:. Slow booting up. Maps not precise in Canada. 
Summary:. Well, I'm trying to guess if I should switch to a Garmin C550. The Tomtom is a VERY cool unit. Very fast route re-alculation, but slow to boot. VERY sleek interface. Intuitive and very complete.. Huge memory (hard drive 20 GB) for maps (America and Europe included). But TeleAtlas seems to be much weaker than Navteq. But I jus ordered New 2006 TeleAtlas Maps. Will they be better ?. The windshield mount seems top work OK (one week) but the Garmin C550 sounds to be better. So, let's hope I'll make the right decision in the next 2 weeks: Sleek and efficient TomTom or better serviced and more accurate Garmin (with only Ameriva's maps). 

$$;
Pros:. Bigger screen than my Garmin I5. 
Cons:. Bright sunlight washes out screen.. 
Summary:. I like the size of the screen, but they still need to improve on visibility in strong sunlight. The remote control has proved somewhat useful (especially if you have long legs and have to sit away from unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, large coverage area, no need for memory card, easy to read 3-D display. 
Cons:. Poor quality of initial batch, doesn't differentiate small/large roads. 
Summary:. I bought my 910 in May '06, and immediately took it to Central Europe. It was a total failure: the GPS signal reception was nearly non-existent, the unit froze and required reset daily, the windshield mount did not hold. Back in the US, it would take 15-20 min to pick up a signal in AM. Over the course of 6 month I updated the system software and firmware, requested (and received) a new mount. The signal much improved. But the unit still malfunctioned, froze, turned off and even turned on spontaneously (and drained the battery). Finally, I forced the TomTom to exchange my unit under warranty, and I got a new one two weeks ago (cost me $20 to ship it to them). Night and day! The first batch was clearly rushed to the stores before it went through QC. The new unit picks up signal before I close my garage door, has not frozen once, etc. So, if you've been suffering from poor reliability, signal strength, etc - call TomTom and have your unit replaced!. As far as the functionality, I think the unit is generally accurate. The most common errors I found are related to some segments of the streets that cross from one town to the other. Also, the street numbers are not terribly accurate, but ususally you find your number once you get to the street. My major issue is that the 910 often picks the smaller roads as opposed to highways. I think the confusion is that some of the small roads have numbered highway denomination. The unit thinks that highway 95 (which is the 4 lane interstate) and highway 27 (which is a 1 lane local road with traffic lights every 100 yards) will give me comparable travel time because they both are called "highways".. As far as advanced features, I rarely use them. I am one of those who think that cell phone should make phone calls, not take pictures. GPS does not have to make my phone calls or play my music. A few POI's I've used were generally accurate.. To compare with the other brands: Magellan that I had on my rental Hertz car doesn't come close to 910. Have not used any others.. 

$$;
Pros:. All functions work well. 
Cons:. Poor Automount &#38; POI DB needs update and more robusk functionality. 
Summary:. Had the unit for 3 months. Worked right out of the box. Tested all functions and they worked. HAd one lockup that required a reset. Automount is the major problem with TT says they have anew design and unit available. If it fixes the mount problems the unit would be as close to a 10 as any one available. POI DB could use more local info and be more up to date. But, this is not different from my GPS on the Lexus or Ford Explorer.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to set up and use, planning routes from computer is a snap. 
Cons:. Never will be any support for PDA phones, misleading information on website. 
Summary:. I spent a lot of time online comparing both the Tomtom 910 and the Garmin Nuvi 350/360. When I went to Best Buy, both were there and I spent about 15-20 minutes per device, before I bought the 910.. The 910 is a great in car device. The navigation is very snappy, very smooth, it's very easy to recalculate a route, extremely easy to plan a whole itinerary with different stops along the way. The voices reading out the directions are great. I mean it'll say "turn right in 1/4 of a mile and then take the second left." You can't argue with efficiency like that. The base feature set I expected is fantastic.. With that said, I wish I bought the Nuvi.. One of the main reasons I opted for the 910 was the cool handsfree features with a Bluetooth phone and the Tomtom plus stuff showing you traffic info and such. My phone is a Windows Mobile PDA phone. The 910 connected to it, but nothing would work. I called support to see if it would be supported anytime in the future.. They told me since it was a PDA phone and I could get the Tomtom PDA Go software, they were never going to have handhelds like the 910 support ANY PDAS. Ever. Not ever. I was stunned since I don't want the Go software, the GPS on my PDA is ultra-slow and sucks battery life.. So now I have an entire feature set that's unusable. On their website, it doesn't even say anything like that. There are no PDA phones listed under "supported phones", but still if they had said "pda phones not supported" I never would've bought it.. On top of that, all of the touted Tomtom Plus features only work through your wireless data plan on your phone - again nothing on the website about that - so all those are out.. I feel very misled about this and will be out the restocking money should I choose to return it since there's technically nothing wrong with the unit.. Tomtom, the lack of information is a no-no.. However if you do have a supported phone, it's a great device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen is both readable and responsive. TTS works well. tomtom traffic feature is surpisingly useful. 
Cons:. mounting mechanism. POI database. Lacking FM transmitter. 
Summary:. I purchased the 910 at BestBuy on 5/9/06. I am not a GPS guru, however, I had purchased my wife a Garmin StreetPilot i3 late last year for just over $300. I was very impressed with the i3 and decided to get a GPS for my car as well. I wanted a larger screen and easier interface than the i3 and also desired traffic info as well since I commute in a large metro area. After looking around, I decided on the tomtom 910 due to its bluetooth capabilities, the tomtom traffic feature, the PC software (more about that later), and the ipod interface possibility.. I will list my opinions in order of strength (most strongest pros/cons first) -. CON - the docking mechanism, which is used both on the auto mount and home dock seems needlessly counter-intuitive and fragile. This sentiment is echoed by the writer of mytomtomgo.com. I share his concern for the long-term wear of this mechanism. I also found it interesting that the CNet editor in the video clearly has trouble with the dock and has to support it with her hand.. PRO - The directions using the TTS are very good. The street names are clear and accurate - I believe this is a definite help while navigating. It is nice not to have to look at the device for the street name if you are not familiar with where you are at.. CON - The POI database is surprisingly weak IMO. The i3 will display the address and phone number of a POI when selected. This is very useful in the case of restaurants and very important in the case of auto repair shops. The only way I have found to get a phone number of a POI is to go into the mobile phone menu and go through the motions of calling the POI through that menu. I have configured my phone for bluetooth connection, however, I am not sure if you could even get the phone number if you do not have a phone configured for the unit. Also, I have not found a way to display the street address of the POI. tomtom customer support confirmed that there is not a way to display this information. I have found the addresses which I have entered to be a bit off. Both my home and office were a half to a whole block off. If this is also true with POIs, not having the street address accessible could be a bit of a hassle.. PRO - The tomtom traffic feature has been surprisingly solid. The information appears up-to-date, the on-screen interface is intuitive and the speed of the download is good.. PRO/CON - The PC software has features both good and bad, the software is useful for backup and restore of the unit in the event of a problem and can also manage itineraries, voices and the like. There is one major UI flaw in the software which has sent numerous 910 owners to call support - when you go to use the software for itinerary planning, a graphic representation of the unit indicates that you need to switch the unit on. The software is asking you to click the graphic on button (not the device's - which has to be on already to get to this point). I and many others called support thinking that the unit was not being recognized - anyway, I am sure they will clarify this in future releases.. My biggest disappointment was that the software did not allow for a import of pc-based contact info into the POI database (i.e., an Outlook contact list). This would have been a great feature - tomtom never stated that it would do this, it was a bad expectation on my part.. PRO - tomtom support has been very responsive to questions. They even emailed a software update which I installed on the unit. This is where I appreciated being able to backup the unit prior to copying operating system files onto the unit.. CON - the lack of an FM transmitter is suprising. With the features of the unit - mp3 player, ipod support (via an additional accessory) and handsfree phone support, it would have seemed to be a no-brainer to add an FM transmitter. Needless to say, a hard-wired aux connection is better, but if you are using the unit in rental cars, or in a car without an aux in connection, an FM connection would be very nice.. Overall -. I like the device in spite of its shortcomings. My biggest concern is the POI data. It seems to be a good performer, however, I would recommend potential buyers to comparison shop and be clear on what you need before jumping into a rather expensive unit. I find the core navigation capability on par with the i3, but not really better. I myself am considering downgrading, but hesitate to lose the traffic feature I have come to value.. 

$$;
Pros:. view clear screen, nice great volume, nice bluetooth connection. 
Cons:. tom tom thinks my house is the next door nieghbors, POI suck.. 
Summary:. OK so here is the real review. I have been looking for this thing for the longest time.. finally while at best buy I asked him out of curiosity when he was going ot get the tomtom 910. He said he got 2 on Monday. Anyways so i got home very excited.. i played around with it and it gave great directions. The only complaint that i have about this thing... which is where i'm comtiplating if i should take it back is that the POI really do suck. I activated all the categories and it didn't even have a 7-11 in it. IF your looking for a high school... your out of luck as well as a lot of other things. The fact that i didn't like the tomtom is that you can't just type in what your looking for, you have to define what poi category it statifies and then look for it. This is the only downfall to the tomtom... but when you think about... it can be a huge one... cause pretty much its breaking down that you have to have the adress to find its way... which sucks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of capability. 
Cons:. Poor implemetation. 
Summary:. Good map data. 20GB hard rive has lots of space for music, books on tape, etc.. Can't charge by mini-usb connector. I wish they would have a mini usb connector directly on the unit for charging and docking.. Bluetooth is poorly implemented. Can't use bluetooth to download files, connect to bluetooth stereo headset, etc.. Windshield mount connector is fair. Suction is good but friction connector gets loose allowing unit to sag.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very accurate maps &#38; MP3 is a plus. 
Cons:. Lack of access to POI data. 
Summary:. I bought this after borrowing my wife's Garmin N�vi 350 on multiple occasions. I go to Germany a few times per year, so the included maps were a big selling point. It came on the market about the same time as the N�vi, but had better maps in it then than the Garmin 2008 update that I just loaded over the weekend. The street that I live on is 4 years old and not yet on Garmin's map update! It was already there in the out of the box 910. The short comings that I have seen with this are as follows:. 1. Unintuitive menu - Garmin is much easier for finding POIs, you don't have to go through the categories.. 2. POI Data - the navigation is based on the GPS coordinates of POIs and not their addresses linked to coordinates. I've been on the road several times when I would have liked to have known the address so I could look on the right side of the street for my destination. You cannot access an address for any POI on this unit. The phone numbers for the POIs work for my Bluetooth phone, but you can only find them if you enable the icons to display on screen and clutter up your map. You can dial up a POI with your phone by navigating through the Mobile Phone menu and then searching POIs. The Garmin system brings up a list of results and let's you pick the one you MAY want to use. It then displays the address and phone number. You can go back to the list if it's not the one you wanted. TomTom automatically sets the destination when you tap on a result in its list. The Garmin results list indicates distance and direction, while the TomTom only gives distance. Also, the Garmin distances and directions are updated dynamically while you're driving. The TomTom locks in your coordinates as soon as you hit "Navigate To".. The positive things about it:. 1. MP3 player - pretty decent sound quality from the speaker and an included cable to jack into your car stereo.. 2. Hands-free phone usage and transfers numbers directly from phone via Bluetooth. I've even used it for a business conference call with other colleagues on my end when our land line phone system crashed.. 3. It's a nice-to-have feature to be able to carry lots of pictures around.. 4. The Navigate to POI along route is a feature that I've used many times for gas and restaurants when on extended drives.. I've used the 910 for the last 4 months in the Atlanta, Cincinnati, Houston, and Pittsburgh areas in the US and in Cologne and D�sseldorf in Germany and the navigation got me where I needed to go. I loved the radar camera warnings in Germany! It comes up 500 meters in advance with a tone and speed limit warning to avoid tickets. There's also a warning feature that you can turn on that indicates if you're speeding relative to the speed limits that it has stored in its database.. The mounting suction cup is not so bad when you set the unit on your dashboard and then swivel it up to meet your windshield. I have had zero problems this way. I did try using it once just supported from the arm and it tilted down under its own weight.. I hope this helps you!. 

$$;
Pros:. Good features, works with w810i, jukebox, hard drive. 
Cons:. map of my home address was not accurate, mount falls in seconds, bad audio connection in the mount. 
Summary:. OK. I had some initial price problems from Buydig.com. I ordered one and paid in full for their advertised price of $341. The next day I got a phone call saying they couldn't ship it because of a pricing error. They then offered to ship it for $400. I was upset and did what most people would. (Use your imagination) About an hour later the Buyer called me an offered it for $380 with free 2-day shipping. I took the offer. NOW TO THE REVIEW:. The unit worked great with my Sony Ericsson phone. The unit works flawlessly with it.. The computer voices pronounce road names correctly about 70% of the time. I guess that is better than just "turn left in 200 feet". Here's the problem I had....even though TomTom supposedly fixed their mount issues, I have a defective mount. It drops the GPS to the dash immediately after it is connected. Secondly, whenever I plug it into the AUX input in my vehicle there is a loud buzz caused by a loose connection to the mount. Whenever I apply pressure to the mount and GPS, pushing them together the buzzing goes away and the music is clear.. TomTom's customer service sucks so far. I put in an online help request four days ago and have heard nothing since the computer-generated auto-reply.. The computer generated auto-reply covered my exact issue...defective mounts. HOWEVER, when the link to get the mount replaced is clicked, it goes to a page that says the promotion has ended.. They should have just built the inputs onto the actual unit.. This may turn out to be a good GPS unit if it is ever given a little help from it's accessories and it's Customer UnService Department.. 

$$;
Pros:. It does the job. 
Cons:. Windshield mount was poor and after a month I did get a new one after becoming angry with them. They had faults and the new update which they said I had was drooping still.. Needed repairs and no parts available. 
Summary:. The windshield mount was defective and drooped and fell off the windshield and dash. It took a month of arguing with Tom Tom to get a relacement as they said I had the update. This new unit windshieid mount kept on falling off the windshield and dash. It broke the pin in the Tom Tom base holder from the cigarette adaptor. Buying a new one from the Source it was the wrong voltage and fried the unit. The Source was great tried to repair the 910. No parts available from Tom Tom and The Sorce replaced with a TomTom 630 whick is a lesser unit but works very well. Light and compact. For me the GO 910 was overkill and I did require all the functions. The GO910 worked ok, the faults are the windshield mount and the lack of parts and service &#38; support . Poor for a company that sells world wide. The GO910 was only 4 years old and cost me 500 bucks. Tom Tom has to re-think some of the customer service. I am glad the unit has been discontinued so no one else can feel the grief of the GO910. 

$$;
Pros:. knowlegeable support staff but be prepared on hold two hourse. 
Cons:. poor manual. Could fix myself if it had troubleshoot info. 
Summary:. Superb product. However...... Telephone support meant wait in excess two uours. Support staff very good but better manual would reduce their load like a troubleshoot page to direct one to the reset button to allow a correct restart of a frozen screen. Why will they not publish solutions readily used by their phone staff ?. 

$$;
Pros:. Brand reliable and practical. User friendly.. 
Cons:. The geniuses at TomTom decided that unlike the Go 300 (which I also have) the 910, which is way more expensive, has to be turned off manually. When my 300 is connected I turn off the ignition. 
Summary:. The 300 turns off by itself, which is very practical. Well the 910 has to be turned off manually because they (TomTom) did not have enough space for some device that enables the GPS to turn off when you turn off the ignition.. Maps are not very updated.. Worst of all, now my 910 does not hold the charge. You charge it and the next day, after not much use, the battery is dead.. So if you're going to get a practical, rugged and inexpensive GPS go for the Go300 or the newer One XL, which seems to be good for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear voice commands. Works in US and Europe. 
Cons:. Hard to reach customer service. Don't really stand by their product even if defect is known. They call fixing a known defect a "promotion" which is available for a limited time.. 
Summary:. As much as I like the product I would never buy another TomTom. There are plenty of good GPS units out there. No need to buy from a company that does not stand by their product.. They had a known defect on their window mounts and offered to send new ones. The only catch was you had to be able to read the serial number which was smeared (again poor quality). I tried numerous time to call but was put in a hold queue so long I had to hang up eventually. When I go through months later, they acknowledged that my unit was one of the defective ones but the "promotion" was not longer valid.. This is the first (and hopefully the last) time I've heard of replacing a defective item as a promotion.. A pity that a company can be so short sighted over a part that costs a few dollars.. 

$$;
Pros:. It is really easy to use . User friendly. 
Cons:. The maps that were in the Two I bought had all the street names wrong I phoned tom tom They told me to go to the computer and update maps.. 
Summary:. If you don't have a computer. DON'T buy this one................... 

$$;
Pros:. Route planning, European/USA maps, touch screen, rich configuration options. 
Cons:. Goofy routes, poor text-to-speech, inaccurate maps. 
Summary:. Where do I start? Bottom line: try before you buy! The list of features really attracted us, especially since we want to take a GPS to Europe and the GO 910 includes European maps. The touch-screen is great, and the menu navigation is easy. The text-to-speech is inviting, the configuration options are tremendous, and the price is right. BUT. The text-to-speech is mediocre. All of the computerized voices (which you have to use if you want the street names announced) have severe pronunciation problems (US English male can't pronounce a 'll' at the end of a street name, US English female sounds like she was gagging on the word "Avenue", both British voices have trouble with the word "Road"!). And the reading of streets with long names, or three words in the name, was so rushed that it was sometimes unintelligible. I understand that this is a computer trying to read text, but the Garmin Nuvi 350 doesn't have these problems. Routing was, ummm, peculiar. The routes got me where I wanted to go, but some of the choices were odd and/or convoluted, to say the least. And why did the unit know that two streets connected from one direction, but not the other (coming from one direction, it insisted "at the end of the road, turn left" - coming from the other it directed me straight through)? The unit also has trouble when two major arteries (like Interstates) merged. In one case, the routing insisted that I follow a road that ends at the merge with another, and never indicated I was even ON the "new" road. It never complained I was going the wrong way, it just didnt'get the road names right. Totally unacceptable. The maps also seem to be peculiarly out of date; mostly they're accurate, but in my neighborhood, the maps (and routing) insist that I turn onto streets that have long been dead-ended or, in one case, never constructed. As much as I love the feature set, if I can't rely on the accuracy of the mapping and routing (and can't understand what it's saying!), it's a $700 MP3/JPEG player. We're returning the GO 910 and purchasing a Garmin Nuvi 350.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great graphics, big screen, easy interface and plethora of features. 
Cons:. Not all features work. 
Summary:. I upgraded (so I thought) from a Tom Tom 700 to the 910 and was very disappointed. My biggest gripe was with the windows suction mount. For such a big and heavy unit, they certainly skimped on the strength of the mount. The suction mount securely held the unit to the window, but the joint (ball and socket type) on which the unit could be adjusted, was flimsy at best. Even with the slightest bump in the road, the unit would point down - and any and all road vibrations went right thru the mounting bracket casuing the entire unit to shake. We gave up and eventually put it in a place so that it could actually rest on the dash - good thing that the remote was included. It was where the front windshield and the dash met, which in turn exposed it to direct sunlight in alost all cases.. In full sunlight the display was difficult to see due to the placement of the unit (see previous gripe).. The auto switching to night/day mode drove us crazy. sometimes it worked and sometimes not. This was one of the features, for which I switched to this unit. Even after upgrading to the latest firmware, no change in behavior.. I was happy with the bigger wide aspect screen. Maps of North America and Europe is nice, but impractical. I doubt that the majority of 910 owners ever take it abroad. POIs were a bit outdated.. Bluetooth phone integration was OK. The external mic picked up a lot of road noise or filtered out the speaker.. The MP3 player and the gobs of extra storage space on the 20gb hard drive was great, but the unit should have come with a FM modulator/transmitter so that the audio could be heard on the car's system - so again a feature that fell a few steps short of being really useful.. So, we ended up returning the unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. very good sound quality for a portable GPS and clear instructions. 
Cons:. see below...... 
Summary:. 1) bad mount design (unit fell off). 2) bad interface design (too many connectors, badly interfaced, can be damaged). 3) weaker sattelite reception than nuvi310 &#38; Tomtom one. 4) Text-to-speech engine is much inferior to nuvi 310. 5) cumbersome software menu design (compared to Garmin's). 6) Poor tech support (the person i spoke to didnt know which GPS chipset is in use). Originaly i owned a nuvi310. Thought Tomtom 910 will outperform nuvi310 and got it exchanged only to realize it was a peice of junk. luckiliy got my old Nuvi back.. 

$$;
Pros:. portable, updateable, lots of features. 
Cons:. too many problems at any price.. 
Summary:. This is my fourth unit in two weeks, Good thing Fry's has a great return policy. Each unit has had a different problem. The fist one just stopped working. The second always locked up and would have to be reset with a paper clip. The third one's clock always. needed to be ajusted and this one, the one I'm getting my money back for tomorrow, no more exchanges, will not stay on the window mount.. Also, I think the graphical interface looks like it was designed for children, please if I'm going to pay $800.00 for this unit show me some respect.. 

$$;
Pros:. EASY and accurate. 
Cons:. Horrible mount. 
Summary:. The interface looks like it was made by apple...smart, easy to use, intuitive. The directions are accurate, and the the device is easy to understand and get going. I was disappointed in that it took over an hour to finally find a GPS signal, though.. I think TomTom should DEFINITELY redesign the mount. The device is actually two parts...a dock/mount and the head unit. The head unit can be removed from the mount in the car, and placed on the dock for your pc. The little black button at the top-center is for releasing the head unit, and hardly works. The connection between the mount and the head unit in the car is very poor. First, the power cable from the cigarette lighter plugs into the mount, NOT the unit itself. So, whenever the mount/unit have a momentary disconnection, the TomTom shuts down. And, this happens much more than I like. Second, although the connection between the mount and the unit FEELS solid, it's always going in and out...there's a little green light that tells you when it's receiving power. Like I said, this happens pretty often. Last, the mount has a ball-and-socket type of joint to position the head unit so you can view it. Sounds good, right? Well, on a hot day (above 90) the lubrication around the ball becomes so viscous that the weight of the head unit causes it to droop. If you have this placed on your windshield in the center-bottom, then the screen will face down toward the dash...making it VERY hard to see.. I like the action, the view, and the system itself, but the design of the mount is fair at best..

Pros:. Harddrive, options, bluetooth. 
Cons:. poor size of maps, mp3, accuracy, software bugs, price. 
Summary:. I have had the unit since release in April, and yes it came out in April, I bought it for my wife and me after our wedding. I bought it after having my PDA version of Tomtom version 5 with gps recievers stolen on Virgin Atlantic. I chose the 910 because I wanted a 4" screen, like my PDA was; hx 4700; 20gig hardrive, mp3 player, remote, and that i liked tomtom over garmin, magellan, and navman of which I tried and used them all for a number of months. What attracted me to Tomtom was that the maps were big and easy to follow and program. Streetnames and warnings were clear and big.. I am disappointed in the following:. 1: the packaging for a $800.00 device should be better than placing the unit on top of a thin cardboard holder.. 2: The windshield mount is poor in that it cannot sustain the tomtom910 in air because of the hardwares weight, worse in warmer weather.. 3: After I connected the bluetooth phone the built in mic was fine until you connected the wired microphone into the mount which permanently disables you using the builtin mic when connected to the mount again.. 4: Yes it has a 4" screen in diameter, but when you really study the unit it is wider yet the height of the screen is smaller than the tomtom 700 unit; this then makes the images of streets, characters smaller than the previous models.. 5: no updated maps since tomtom navigation 5 navigated to roads that have changed like on the Gardenstate Pkwy at exit 150 - 160, Westside avenue- palisade avenue in secaucus. and U.S. 1 - 9 Express lane has fewer exits since construction in Elizabeth/Newark. This is to list a few. They are over 4 years old.. 6: Playing Mp3 is great but when your navigating and need the map you have to switch out of the screen to the mp3 player to change songs.. 7: When rerouting or changing songs the verbal instructions start stuttering.. 8: the hardware shuts off after a certain time is used continuously-- maybe overheating.. 9: The connection to the windshield mount is faulty and difficult. you have to line up the tomtom perfectly for it to engage the mount and charge. And taking it off is equally as hard-- try not to break a finger.. 10: After 2 month of use the mount would lose connection with bumps, meaning its not charging and would automatically shut off.. 11: the accuracy of the unit is sub par- more than 15 meters off and placing you on different streets, in NYC. The satellite pick-up is great tho. With my PDA and Navman 4410 or Tomtom reciever the accuracy was great.. Discussion: the features are great however the programming such as the mp3 player is not user friendly, especially driving. This makes the hardrive worhtless on the road. The screen size, although a 4" screen, is smaller than the 700 model making viewing streetnames difficult. Yes I have better than 20/20 vision too. Mounting is poor making the unit sometimes losing suction.(very bad).. Conclusion: The features are not usable thus not needed wasting a good idea and an unwanted increase in price. The unit should be around $500. The screen needs to be bigger yes, but to allow the street names and maps to be more easily viewable.( more eyes on the road than straining to see what street coming up next). A stonger and more durable mount and connection. Updated maps. More accurate gps reciever.. I feel tomtom has great products, however this version is a small step back. If I could I would opt for an older model until they fix these issues.. Updated. on Nov 10, 2008.

Pros:. Slick interface, nice feature set. 
Cons:. None of the above work very well. 
Summary:. I already own a smaller Garmin unit that I wanted to upgrade. When shopping, I looked at all the units out there. My eye caught this one because of the features. After buying the unit and using it for a week, I can say I honestly hate it. The POI database does not have phone numbers that your bluetooth phone can access. On the garmin c550, if you look up something in the POI database, it gives you phone numbers and will connect you to them at the press of a button. The mounting bracket is a joke. Seriously, who designed the bracket? The actual navigation is actually pretty good once you get used to using it. The Garmin interface is much more intuative to use. Customer service was not very good. I called for help, and they did not really know the product very well. In the end, I would say this product is a classic case of form over function. Very evident that this product is from a European company. I will be returning this for the Garmin C550 which has the same feature set and is the same price..

Pros:. Everything BUT THE MOUNTING SYSTEM. 
Cons:. The mounting system. 
Summary:. I have taken a couple statistics classes at school and feel comforable concluding that the mounting system on TomTom's GO 910 is a result of poor engineering. (The odds that I've gotten two "lemons" in a row seem slim.). The mount itself is plugged into the cigarette lighter power cord. The TomTom unit is supposed to "click" onto the mount and the little pins on the mount are supposed to connect with the pins on the unit so that the TomTom will charge. The green light at the top left of the unit turns on when the unit is recieving power. Unfortunately, the first unit I bought at BestBuy would not connect securely to the mount, and thus the TomTom would not charge. I could wiggle and push the mount and the unit together and sometimes get the two to stay connected for a short time, but eventually the connection would be lost and the TomTom would cease charging. So I exchanged it for a new unit. Same thing. And THIS TIME, not only would the mount and the unit not stay connected, but the locking ball joint loosened up and will not hold the unit in the right position. Gravity slowly tilts the unit downwards until you'd have to be sitting on the floor of the car looking up to see what is on the screen.. This is unfortunate because besides the poorly designed mounting system, I love the GO 910! I love the way it operates, the text-to-speech is terriffic, and it's a joy to use.. I've noticed the maps in some (or maybe all) cases are at least three years old. I work in a lot of newer neighborhoods, and I've noticed that any streets under three years old are not in the map database.. Also, I tried finding an iPod cable for the unit. I searched high and low and couldn't find a place to buy one in the states. Annoying.. 

$$;
Pros:. I thought it was easy to use.. 
Cons:. Doesn't last. Not durable.. 
Summary:. 1) the documentation is woefully incomple. I hate when troubleshooting, the answer to my GO 910 doesn't work, is "did you push the power button?". 2) I don't use it very much. After awhile the screen froze. I had to spend an hour with customer service adding updates and then I had to re-charge. If this was in the documentation, I could have done it myself.. 3) I've had it for about two years, but I've only used it about 20 or 30 times. I took it out of the box, and it wouldn't turn on. It wouldn't charge. No one responded to my email. I finally got someone on the phone. Her first questions? Did you charge it. #$%$^@&#38;@. She had me re-set then said finally that the battery was dead. I asked her how to replace it, and she said buy a battery at Radio Shack. When I asked her how to remove the battery she said that they weren't instructed on removing the battery for obvious reasons. Obvious reasons? So you can't be helpful?. 4) I called back because Radio Shack said that they never had batteries. I was told that I would have to pay for repairs. The cost was the same as for a new unit. They didn't recommend changing the battery. Well of course not. There is no money in it..

Pros:. Oh so many features. 
Cons:. Too bad so many are uselss or don't work.. 
Summary:. TOM TOM GO 910. I purchased this unit in June 2007 specifically because it had a map of Europe preloaded. I brought the TomTom home 3 days before departure, charged the unit at home and then drove a day to get familiar with the controls. So far so good.. I packed the unit for my trip to central England where I planned to spend several days driving though the country. Mistake  to save weight I only took the car connecting stuff. Arriving in London, I installed the 910 in the rental car and set off on my trip. The TomTom has a nasty shortcoming  it powers ON when it senses power to the connector, but does not power OFF when the ignition is turned off. The three-hour battery (only 1 hour after 8 months) died overnight since the unit was still ON when I parked. Day two the unit was still dead after powering on the car. A call to TomTom was fruitless; I was on hold for so long my calling card expired. The unit was simply dead for the rest of my stay in England.. After exchanging the unit for a replacement, I have learned to tolerate the many faults that make this unit a less than pleasurable experience. (Its that or shell out more money for another brand). "	I purchased the unit in June and exchanged in July. The maps are hopelessly out of date. Here in California there are housing developments built in 2005 that are not in the US maps.. "	I live in an unincorporated part of Orange County, California with a Santa Ana mailing address. TomTom 910 considers me to be living in the city of Orange. To be fair, I am about 200 feet from Orange city limits, but I do not live in Orange. This is not a GPS function; it is a map problem. TomTom support tells me they are not responsible for the map data.. "	The unit always announces, You have reached your destination when I am hundreds of yards short of my destination. In dense neighborhoods, this is often 2 to 3 turns short of my actual arrival point. Yes, the map indicates where I should be, but depending on the voice prompts it is a joke to ever reach the correct driveway or even the correct city block.. "	I finally was able to reach TomTom Support via email about the power issue. I include the reply below:. Thank you for contacting TomTom Customer Support with regards to making a GO 910 power off and on with the car. This feature was available in older versions of the application, but it was bugged so it has been removed. The unit would turn on and off with the car, but it would also reset itself whenever the car hit a large enough bump in the road. If you would still like this feature, you can download an older version of the application at www.tomtom.com/4987.The tech indicated the OFF feature was removed because the unit would turn off when going over bumps. Funny, my Garmin has a 30 second count down timer and has never accidently powered off.. "	As many others have written the reset error is very disconcerting. Whenever the power runs down (a frequent occurrence when jumping out of the car with a load of papers or groceries), I need to bring the unit into the house and charge the device on its poor fitting desk stand. TomTom support has told me the car charger is only to maintain a charge, but is incapable of charging a discharged battery.. "	To press the reset requires a pin or needle. As a single guy, I often have neither. The reset button is too small to touch with a straightened paper clip.. "	The power cord does not stay in the ugly docking cradle. To charge the unit I need to carefully balance the device on the cradle and tape the power cord in the stand. Oddly enough, the USB cable is permanently attached, but the dc cord is a very loose fit and often pulls out, leaving me with a dead battery even after an assumed overnight charge.. "	Unlike my Garmin, the TomTom 910 cannot accept third party maps. I frequently travel in Mexico ad was able to buy a basic map for that county. No such availability for TomTom.. "	Missed turns are quietly rerouted. The Garmin I am familiar with will announce, Recalculating. Often, the best thing is to retrace my route until I am back where I should have been. TomTom does not indicate my mistake, and it has often cost me many miles to follow the new route to my destination.. "	As I said, I bought the device in June 2007 expecting a year of free traffic subscription. When I contacted TomTom, they indicated the promotion ending at the end of 2006. This is also what the materials in the box indicate.. "	Itinerary planning is what TomTom calls a multi stop trip. But, the 910 default is to make intermediate stops waypoints, not destinations. More than once, my girlfriend has driven right past her first stop with nary a peep from the TomTom since it was just a waypoint. (Other than to use alternative routing, why are waypoints necessary? Destinations should be the default setting.). "	The suction mount securely fastens to the window however; the weight of the 910 requires a pillow under the unit to hold it from falling towards the dashboard.. There are some positive aspects to the 910. "	The street announcement is a very nice feature, one my girlfriend really appreciates. Newer upline models from most manufacturers also have this feature.. "	The Bluetooth is a great hands free device for my cell phone; first a Motorola Razr and now a Blackberry Curve.. "	I have never tested the picture storage, not sure why I would want to see a slide show of family photos while I drive.. "	I also have never used the mp3 feature. Why would I listen to music from the built-in speaker when my car has a multi-speaker set-up? And no, my car 2007 car does not have an auxiliary audio input jack.. "	There are many voices in the GPS and more can be downloaded. Okay, I will admit on my first day on England (remember it only worked my first day) I did set the voice to a British accent. Since getting my replacement unit, I have never changed the voice.. In conclusion, I feel TomTom was out to sell a device with as many features as one could imagine into the 910. Sadly, they did a mediocre job of the most basic function of a GPS  fast and simple routing.. I received an email awhile back inviting me to apply to their advisory panel. I never heard back. I assume they reviewed my communications and only wanted positive voices heard.. Would I but another TomTom? Not unless I could get a 30 day trial. Most stores here in California give no more than 14 days to return a technology device.. Do I miss my Garmin Quest? No, I use it in my every day truck. I let the girlfriend use the TomTom.. Yes, I know the TomTom Go 910 is discontinued; but I write this review as personal therapy. Good Luck to anyone buying one on eBay. Hey, does anyone want mine, I still have the box?. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a lot of extra useless features.. 
Cons:. Very poor software! Useless POI. Takes forever to find position on startup (up to 15 minutes). Slow tracking of location. Cheap suction cup that can't hold the weight of the unit.. 
Summary:. TomTom should be embarrassed they released this product onto the market. I had an old Garmin unit before I purchased the TomTom 910 and I prefer to use the old Garmin as it was better in EVERY way other than having to load maps onto a compact flash drive.. What is wrong with the TomTom 910?. The main function is to get you from point A to point B with as little hassle as possible. The TomTom will get you there but with a lot of frustration. Because the unit is slow in tracking your movement you will be sure to miss many turns on the way to your destination.. Also, the point of interest is incredibly useless. The entire software package seems to be thrown together without fully evaluating the need of the customer or without thought of how the unit would be used.. There are some serious issues with the algorithm!!. Don't buy!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a good memory. 
Cons:. It doesn't do the basics, like turn off with your ignition.. 
Summary:. The TomTom 910 is as far as I am concerned a big backwards step for GPS'. TomTom has focused on being able to store pictures and play music while it has forgotten the basics for a GOOD GPS System. The 910 with the battery that takes forever to charge and runs out much earlier that the specification states, does not have the basics like ignition sensing. That means that every time you switch off your car the power is being chewed up unless you remember to reach over and push the power button off every time. It has also shown itself to have many software bugs. This is most likely because the TomTom team was too exited that they could play MP3's while looking at their holiday snaps, and forgot that these units need to be robust and reliable. My POI warnings and phone ring tone no longer work ever since I played the TomTom sample MP3's. Add to the fact that TomTom does not have any POI's, tour guides etc. to be purchased for the Australian market and you realise that for the price you can buy 2 reliable units from the leading competitor.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Tech support for me.. 
Cons:. Bluetooth and others in my opinion.. 
Summary:. Not many phones are compatible with the Go 910. Check before buying the Go 910. I have Verizon and I have a LG VX8300 and the touch screen Bluetooth is worthless to me. Can't zoom out have have it stay there. After about 3 to 5 seconds, zooms back to, close road settings. Always liked my Garmin StreetPilot 1610 zooming features. When traveling, like to zoom it out to about 2 miles, gives you plenty of time to see what is ahead of you. Also, makes it hard to mark your spot and name it, so you can come back later. Also every time I set a destination to go to, always takes me a round about route to get some where. If I didn't know somewhat, where I wanted to go, I would be buying more gas to get to my destination.. Bottom line, if I knew what I know about the Tom Tom Go 910, I would have stayed with a Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. Mounting bracket has all the wire connections - makes it much easier to grab the GPS unit and go; comes with all the wires and connections you need; home computer docking station. 
Cons:. Doesn't keep time properly; seems too many are DOA. 
Summary:. This GPS unit would be fantastic if it weren't for a few MAJOR issues - just read through some of the ratings and opinions on here! My 910 did not work at all - no GPS signal found. It did not keep accurate time - I found it to be off by about 8-10 minutes after only an hour (seems to be a common problem).. I did like that the unit came with the external mic, home power cord, docking station, and a carrying case. I just bought a Garmin c550 to replace the 910, and it only came with the carrying case and vehicle power adapter. However, the Garmin DID come with the FM TMC (traffic report) hardware built into the power cable - TomTom wanted $80 for their version. TomTom seems to want money for just about everything. Their website is TERRIBLE - just try looking up answers to common questions. The fact that you have to go all the way through the FAQ just to get their contact information should have been the first clue to stay far far away from TomTom.. The bluetooth did not work all that well with my phone - the Garmin seems to sync with it perfectly. In fact, my phone has voice activated command capabilities, and when paired with the Garmin c550 I can use my cell phone's voice dialing (TomTom wouldnt do this). TomTom did have a GREAT idea - many people complained in the past about the mounting arm - but I found mine to be great. It is much better than the Garmin's, since all of the power/mic/ext antenna connections are on the arm, not the unit. That makes the TomTom MUCH easier to grab and go - with the Garmin I have to unplug everything first.. One more note on the TMC (traffic reporting) issue mentioned earlier - I had Garmin's up and running in under a minute and found accidents near me that I would otherwise not known about. The TomTom requires a special antenna you have to buy separately - and it's expensive. Further - it is almost impossible to tell if TomTom really supports traffic reports, since their website states the United States is included on one page, then says it is not included on another. (Note - you have to pay a subscription fee after the 3-month trial with Garmin).. If you are looking to buy the 910 - at least look at the Garmin c550 first. The TomTom appears to be mostly marketed to Europeans, with the US market added as an afterthought. Their website is geared towards Europeans, and everything (including traffic services) is listed in Euro. The 910 might seem great, but it appears to me to be cheaply made and horrifically bad customer service.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works it's fantastic - very helpful and easy to use.. 
Cons:. It only works for a few days before completely shutting off.. 
Summary:. I'm about to go return my second 910 in 8 days.. There is some kind of design flaw involved in the mounting mechanism that simply breaks and fails. Too bad the guys who designed the brains of this machine didn't come up with a better mounting system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact unit with the latest features. 
Cons:. I couldn't see the screen wearing my prescription sunglasses.. 
Summary:. The polarizing anti-glare screen is oriented such that it interacts with polarizing prescription sunglasses so as to render the screen black. You have to rotate either your head or the TomTom 90 degrees (not really a viable alternative), or not wear sunglasses. None was an acceptable option for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. US and Euro Maps Preloaded. Big Hard Drive for MP3's. 
Cons:. Poor Mount, Poor POI's, No Handsfree Line Out, Poor Tech Support. 
Summary:. I really tried to like this product, but for $800, it is not worth the trouble.. This product is feature laden, but it is not ready for prime time. The biggest problem for me was the mount system. I understand what TomTom was going for with the mount, but it just does not work. The drooping of the unit is real. I went through 4 910's and one mount shipped directly from TomTom that over time started to droop. I wound up returning it, because TT tech support would not say if they were ever going to fix the problem. They are being told to just replace the mounts until the customer gets a good one (or gives up).. My second issue is POI's. They are really really bad. They do not show you phone numbers or addresses. For that you need to go into another screen (view maps) search for poi's, zoom in, and find an address that is close to the poi. The TT910 will not tell you what the address of the POI under any circumstances.. Handsfree mode seems to work pretty well except that the line output is muted during calls. You can listen to MP3's and route directions through your car stereo, but calls can only be heard over the TT910 speakers. This incorporates a huge drop in quality and seems out of place for a $800 toy. My conversation with tech support indicates that muting has been designed into the 910 and will not ever be fixed.. The maps are kinda suspect too. My home street was not in the right place. It was 300 feet off. Most times, the directions wer spot on, but several times during trips, wrong direcions were given that, if followed, could have caused considerable issues as well as the smirk of my wife.. The interface is not very well thought out either. There are many common functions that require too many screen presses to access. For example, to clear a route, you have to press the screen SIX times.. On the positive side, the 4" widescreen is very nice to have, as well as the European maps. That being said, the routing on my recent trip to Germany was very bad. A 1.5 trip took 3 hours because the TT took me the long way around and even hit a couple of roadblocks.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice display, bluetooth, additional voices. 
Cons:. No addresses or phone numbers listed. 
Summary:. Bought this unit last week. Had to make a way to attach it to my dash, wind shild to far away and that is the only mount you get. When I went to find a restaurant that I knew was in the area, knew the street, but not really which way to go. When I looked for the restaurant, It found it, but it would not tell me where it was, address, just take me there. And there is no phone number so I can call and see if they are open before I start navigating there. You can call the POI's, but you have to have a bluetooth phone and call through the phone menu system. And if you mark a location off the map, in a parking lot, the 910 cannot bring you back to that location. You have to stay in the street and mark it there. Also, if you put on polarized sunglasses, the sceen goes black, very dim. Going to get the Garmin 2820 or C550 when it comes out.. 

$$;
Pros:. I'll skip the pros since the reviews have covered them. 
Cons:. Poor screen visability is sunlight, No Blackberry Bluetooth support, Crazy mount system, Poor USA feature support.. 
Summary:. Wow, where do I start? After waiting 6 months for this product to come out I discovered that our local Best Buy had received 6 units. I scrambled down to snag one thinking that they would all be gone during the 10 minutes it took me to drive there. After purchasing, I took the time to open and inspect the unit before I left the parking lot. Good thing I did because the $800 device was packaged in a brittle egg carton type material that completely disintegrated and the GPS was free to rattle around in the box during shipping. I tried to power up and nothing....dead in the box. I took the unit back in to the store and showed them what happened and they said they would get me another one. Fortunately I asked them to open the box of the new one and to our surprise, the same thing had happened. They opened all 6 boxes and 5 out of 6 devices were damaged to some degree. You would think that they would spend more than 10 cents to package a $800 GPS. Reluctantly I accepted the one unit that did not appear damaged and DID power up. Upon power up the first thing you notice is that the default language is NOT English. You spend the next half hour trying to find the language change screen while blind because it is several layers into the menu and instructions on how to change is not in the manual. I powered up and decided to give it a try and map my way home. One of the features of the 910 that attracted me to it was the "text to speech" that allows the unit to say street names and not gut "turn right", etc. Guess what....not supported in English and feature is grayed out in the menu. The second feature that really attracted me to the TOM TOM GO 910 was Bluetooth and being able to use my Bluetooth phone "hands free". Disappointment #2....Blackberry devices are not supported. Actually there are not that many phones that are supported after looking at the TOM TOM web site. Being that the Blackberry is one of the most popular Bluetooth devices out there, and there are more Blackberries on this planet than any other cell phone, you would think that it would be supported. I just don't get that since I can buy a cheap $30 Bluetooth headset and it connects to ALL Bluetooth devices. My next observation was the strange mounting system for the 910. The only option you have is the windshield mount that comes with the 910. The suction cup mounting is well designed and works great but the other end that mates to the 910 is just insane. It has a weird connector which requires the user to couple the two ends at just the right angle to engage the electrical connector and lock the two ends together. Now disconnecting is a different story. Be prepared to get out a crow bar to separate the two. Ok, I'm exaggerating but not by much. There is a release button on the front of the 910 that you press and is supposed to disengage the 910 from the mount. Not so easy! You must press the button and pull REALLY hard to separate. I mean so hard that you think that it is going to break. This requires you to remove the entire system from your windshield since it would be almost impossible to disengage the 910 from the mount while it's still on your windshield. Want another mounting option other than your windshield? Forget it, it's not an option. Actually, there are no options or accessories currently available for the 910. I'm sure that they will have them eventually on their web site but not yet. Ok back to my first nav trip home. The 910 worked flawlessly and took me right to my front door. When I arrived I went to clear the current route from the 910 and could not figure it out. I spent the next 20 minutes going from menu to menu to find an option to clear the route and NOTHING. Finally I found a option button to add more menu items. I selected that and it added several more layers of menu items. I paged through all the menu items and found on the very last page a button to "Clear Route". YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME! I could go on but will leave it here. One last thing.......be real careful to check the availability of the Tom Tom Plus features because not all of them are available in the USA either. In summary, I traded a prefectly good Garmin 2620 StreetPilot for the 910 and really regret it. I should have waited for the new Garmins with Bluetooth to come out this fall.. 

$$;
Pros:. There is not much to like about this.. 
Cons:. Unhelpful support, poor support, user unfriendly TomTom home app, very poor online system.. 
Summary:. With the number of people that use TomTom you would think they would put something back into their support service and spend a little more on their online development, purchase emails come through with some parts in English then the purchase items in goodness knows what language, why would TomTom think their users would want emails broken up into two languages? daft, showns how much this is an unprofessional company.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features: bluetooth, touch screen, etc. 
Cons:. Can't reliably calculate optimal routes. 
Summary:. Great design, poor implementation. Here's the lastest note to tech support I wrote today to TomTom. From this, you should get the gist of why you don't want what otherwise would be a gorgeous unit, which is less than three months old:. Several questions: When I power on, frequently I can hear a clicking sound as if the hard drive has a bad sector. Other times, boots right up. This began within a few weeks of me getting the unit. Next, although I can use my blackberry Pearl to reach the Internet through a computer using bluetooth, I cannot do the same on the TomTom. And finally. I'm consistently being led down the garden path with routes that literally send me in a circle to get across the street. It's so bad, it even says I have to walk 400 yards to get to my own house when I'm in my house. In Hawaii, it guided me back to the hotel from the same route seven different ways, none of them optimal. In Phoenix, it took me in a horseshoe shaped route to a destination, adding several miles. It did the same round about routing when I was in the Boston area. And ditto on several other trips in metropolitan areas such as Denver, Minneapolis and so forth . This is regardless of whether I use shortest or fastest route. I very rarely find the correct route unless I consult a map.. As a consequence, I am wasting time and gas. Also, because of this, I've given my Go 910 a pet name. I call her "Leading", as in "Miss Leading." I am constantly being driven to distraction by Miss Leading. I'd say driven to drink, but she can't get me to the bar.. Oh, another thing: She consistently comes up a good 100 yards or so short of addresses and she also NEVER says whether the destination is on the left or the right.. I've heard about your new map corrections program, but you are requiring me to purchase new maps to participate in that system. I consider the mapping flawed and I think I should get new maps for free. Can I load another company's maps into this unit? I had a very cheap unit OEM-d to Belkin for use via bluetooth on a PDA or laptop. It was very basic, but VERY accurate. It even displayed altitude. All I get from Miss Leading is attitude!.

Pros:. Lots of features, good value for the price. 
Cons:. Unreliable, miserable support. 
Summary:. I bought this unit because it offered features that the Garmin couldn't touch. It still does, frankly - the feature set is very seductive. But I should've listened to the sales folks - Garmin is the leader for a reason. The problem is that there appears to be shoddy manufacturing for these units, and if you're unlucky enough to get a bad one, Holland-based TomTom BV couldn't care less. The third one of these that broke on me (first one failed to charge after 3 months, 2nd one was DOA, and third started exhibiting a well-documented reset issue) was sent back to TomTom and what did they do? Burn a new software image on the disk, apply a screen protector, and ship it back to me! Three days later, it died again (of course - it's not the software, it's the unit). I'm waiting to hear back from Customer Service at TomTom and if no word shortly, will take Tweeter's offer of a trade-in (on a Garmin. I don't know if the 920 is any better, but after spending $600 on this on unit, plus a 2nd mount, the FM adapter, the iPOD cable, and having it installed in my car, I'm leery to spend more money on anything TomTom.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast refresh of position, awesome route screen, unmatched usabilty. 
Cons:. Both of mine died within weeks of purchase, MP3 Player buggy. 
Summary:. Buy the extended waranty if you buy this TomTom. The 1st one's hard drive failed after leaving it in the car overnight once in 30 degree weather. The second just stopped turning on after a week of use!!. The MP3 Player is very buggy, you can't just copy MP3's to the hard drive, you need to use the TomTom Home program from your PC. And once they are in there, the play back is proceeded by a popping sound. The Bluetooth isn't compatible with my Blackjack from Cingular for anything except recieving calls and there is a major delay in the time it take to connect your call, You can't see the screen in bright sunlight. The unit is heavy, the Point of interest database navigated me to gas stations that were closed 3 years ago. The routing took me off my route then back on again after taking an exit. Typing an address requires the use of tiny fingers or a pen which stains the screen by the way.. Heard enough? OK I tried TomTom's best, and Garmin's best (the nuvi 660 which is not much better in in most areas worse. see my review) guess it's off to try another one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick Rerouting plenty of features. 
Cons:. comes with Computer Virus pre-installed from factory. 
Summary:. poor and slow support unit came with Trogan horse virus that infected my computer TOMTOM knew about it but in did not update owners of possible danger. When virus trashed my computer and could not backup the device or install maps and I mentioned the malware files installed they did not fess-up to a virus. They had me ship the unit back to them at my cost and never mentioned the virus and still have not offered compansation even after admitting it on Jan 29th 2007. Beware!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great feature set. 
Cons:. Window plunger doesn't hold well, Tom Tom breaks very easily.. 
Summary:. After reading Cnet's and PC Magazine's glowing reviews, we bought a Tom Tom Go 910 and used it to drive from Eagle River, Alaska to Seattle, Washington; then from Seattle to Provo, UT.. In Alaska and in Canada, the GPS was less accurate in rural areas. For instance, it placed us in a river along side the road rather than on the road, but I wouldn't make a trip like this without one.. As soon as we arrived in Utah though, it broke. I cannot explain how it happened. Luckily for us, Best Buy took it back and replaced it with no hassle.. Now, a few months later, our 2nd Tom Tom Go 910 is broken, and we haven't a clue why. It doesn't get banged around, or left in a car. In fact, it has spent most of its life alone in a drawer and is only used when we drive someplace new.. When it works, we LOVE the thing, and loved setting it so a woman with an English accent guided me (my wife is English), but I wouldn't buy one again.. We will be replacing this with a Garmin, simply because they've been doing this longer and perhaps they make them more durable.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works the unit is suitable. 
Cons:. Keeps breaking down. 
Summary:. I have now owned 2 of the Tomtom 910s Both broke down within a month. The courier company that collects the defective unit to go back to Tom-tom tells me that they are kept busy by defective 910's. Tom-tom promises a 5 business day turnaround or a new one. I have not received my replacement unit in 6 weeks albeit many broken promises. I will not use Tom-tom again. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear verbal instructions. 
Cons:. I never got a GPS signal on my trip to the French Riviera, out dated maps in US. 
Summary:. I bought the 910 so I could find my way around the French Riviera. I changed to the european maps at the airport so I could find my hotel. In the 8 days I was in France, I was NEVER able to get a GPS signal no matter where I traveled on the coast. This had a significant impact on getting around on my vacation and was a major disappointment. I sent a report to Tomtom and have yet to receive a response.. The development I live in was built 5 years ago yet my street is not available. When I get to the nearest major route the 910 instructs me to take a right and make a U-turn at an intersection that has never allowed a U-turn. The proper instruction should be to take a left turn there is no obstruction to prevent this.. I wanted to pre-program my France trip plan, but could not bring up the european maps while in the US to accomplish this task.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features such as touch screen. Extremely user friendly. Wonderful selection of voices.. 
Cons:. Highly inaccurate navigation, NO SUPPORT, constantly have to reboot the device, the windshield mount and docking stand are horrible and impossible at times to dock the device.. 
Summary:. I purchased the 910 in June and initially thought this device was wonderful. It has a magnificent touch screen, amazing features such as bluetooth compatibility, and the ability to load MP3 files and pictures into the device. However, the base function of the device should be to provide accurate directions, and it seriously lacks that ability. I tried it around the town and local city where I lived and found about 20% of the time it provided accurate directions. I gave it the ultimate test. To try and navigate from my home to the major airport I travel from each week. The roads in between are interstate and large heavily accessed roads. It couldn't even navigate to the Airport! It sent me on a wild goose chase ending up about 3 miles away from the airport on the opposite side of the field near a Airplane manufacturing plant!. Also, it has the annoying problem of announcing that you need to turn left then right while going down a perfectly straight road. I thought this may just be the small rural roads I sometimes use, but then I was using it in Newark, NJ on a MAJOR interstate and it did the same obnoxious "turn left then right" several times. On the maps it appears that there is a crook in the road despite the fact that the road is perfectly straight.. I personally have used the magellan and garmin products that were by no means as "high-tech" as this device and they have worked perfectly. I thought initally that I may have a bad unit, but have spoken to several other Tom Tom users in the USA and they all have similar problems. I have friends that live in the UK and France and they say the maps are wonderful, and the product navigates correctly almost all the time. I guess the map company that supplies the maps just isn't the most accurate company for North America.. Another infuriating problem is that the unit consistanly needs to be reset. You must do this several times a day. It is ok when you are sitting still or at a traffic light, but when on the road it can cause an accident. My unit also cannot keep accurate time, it gives all kind of wild readings each time you turn the unit on. You would think since it synchs up with the GPS system, it would be able to retain accurate time.. I am having a horrible time even contacting support. Just go to their website and see if you can find a support contact. I tried going into the TOM TOM home product you use to update your Tom Tom but in the help search there is NOTHING under support.. Please, I caution everyone do more research before you buy this product. I dearly wish I could return it at this point!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact, strong, maps pre-loaded. Hard drive prevents from losing data if not charged.. 
Cons:. Dashboard mounting, map details, box information misleading. 
Summary:. I recently bought a Tomtom 910 GO, in the hope that I would be able to get the services suggested in the box.. Bottom line is that you only get the GPS facility, and the disapointment of finding out that the level of map details is WAY less than the CitySelect which I use in my Garmin iQ3600.. Lack of zip codes (only UK/NL), street names and numbers, airport/terminal locations are nerve racking. Marking waypoints require "navigation" skills and POI are not visible on screen.. Do not trust what the box says !! make sure you ask the salesperson if they know what mobile phones can get connected through bluetooth/wi-fi (most don't ...).. I will give away the Tomtom to the kids ..... 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looking Unit. 
Cons:. Mount is terrible, screen unreadable in sunlight. 
Summary:. I had this unit only 10 minutes and took it back. I bought it at Best Buy and tried to get it to work in the parking lot. The windshield mount was so loose, the unit just flopped around. I had to mount it so the unit touched the dashboard. By doing this, it was in direct sunlight and I couldn't read the screen. Also, the bluetooth wouldn't recognize my Motorola Razr and that is why I bought this unit in the first place. Luckily I had the salesperson at Best Buy write on the sales slip that if the unit wouldn't connect to my phone I could take it back for a full refund, which they did. Please do yourself a favor and look at the Garmin C550, it is a much better unit. With so many posts about the mounting unit, what is TomTom's problem with getting a better one.. 

$$;
Pros:. good routes with good satellite access. 
Cons:. bad window mount, awful performance in city. 
Summary:. I was the previous owner of a Lowrance 500iway. The screen was good, the window mount was excellent. It was definitely not user friendly(intuitive) and the routing was not the best. I took a big loss since the prices have gone way down and prepared to buy a new GPS for the auto. I zeroed in to the tomtom go910 and the garmin nuvi360. I read all the helpful reviews on cnet and because I needed something sooner than later, I decided to buy the 910. Packaging was fine as well as all the includec accessories. Installing the software was very easy and the feature to do everything through the computer was great. So far so good, right-WRONG. I proceeded to go outside my house since there was no signal in the house. I walked almost four blocks without the unit to be able to access the satellites. I finally got in my car, don't ask how this happened, but now it locked on the satellites. I asked it to go to home(where I was at) figuring there would be so many feet of error, wrong again. The unit had my house on another section of the neighborhood something the Iway never did. so I asked it to find my house based on the gps. This worked well. Now to the trip itself. I will be travelling frequently to Chicago from Florida so this is why I needed the gps primarily. The unit came up with a nice route to our destination, confirmed by a mapblast and a mapquest search. About 200miles into the trip the unit turned off. I had read about this so I new what to do. This mount for the windshield is awful. The unit kept on turning itself off during our trip. Finally, i had read that there is a triangular piece on the TomTom that if removed would solve the problem. They were right on problem solved, but now my unit is altered(shouldn't have to do this with an 800 dollar unit. Got to my son's apt without difficulty, but when trying to go to our hotel the unit could not lock on to the satellites and when it did it gave very funky information. We got lost! We used the unit to go out of the city and once again did well on the freeway, but when we were to leave the hotel, once again no satellite lock and so our 15 hr. ride back home took us another 30 min thanks to the weak performance of the unit. Even though the software is very intuitive and easy to use, I cannot recommend this unit!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of features including Bluetooth, MP3, European Maps. 
Cons:. Poor Quality, Too Many gadgets in the box, large. 
Summary:. I purchased the TomTom Go 910 because I needed the GPS maps for Europe. It was the only GPS at a national electronics store chain with the European Maps preloaded. Interestingly, the sales person told me that he didn't recommend TomTom becuase there were a lot of returns but, he mentioned that this brand was very popular in Europe. So, I took a chance. Problem #1 - The unit simply stopped working after the third time I used it. So, I took it back to the store and they replaced the unit no questions asked. Problem #2 - I was impossible to detach the GPS unit from the windshield mount. This was very fusterating becuase I had to carry the system on the plane in my lap because it wouldn't fit in the bag. Problem #3 - For almost US$1,000 you would think you would get a smaller unit. It's a small boulder to lug around. Compare it to the Germin Nuvi 350 which is the size of a deck of cards for the same price. In the end, I traded it in for the Germin which is what the salesperson recommended in the first place. I'll get the European maps seperately.. 

$$;
Pros:. reputation of Tom Tom from owning the 700. 
Cons:. Bad Design and Terrible Service at Best Buy. 
Summary:. Having owned the TomTomGo 700 and totally satisfied with that unit, I sold my TomTom700 as soon as I heard that the 910 was about to be released. I was one of those guys that rushed to the local Best Buy in the bay area hoping to buy one of the only two units that were delivered. They were gone by the time I reached the store so I raced over to the east bay in rush hour traffic and got one. I unpacked the unit in the car out in the Best Buy parking lot and it was DOA right out of the box. I won't bore you with all the details but I couldn't get it to power up. Returning to the store, the sales "expert" at Best Buy spent the better part of an hour trying to get the unit to work rather than just giving me another unit. I later learned that Best Buy salesreps are extremely sensitive about returns even though they brag about no commission sales, apparently they do get a "hit" whenever a product is returned under their signature. Finally the salesrep gave me the only other unit they had left in the store. The exact same thing happened- it was DOA. The same sales rep spent another hour trying to get the unit to work, I had been at Best Buy the better part of 3 hours by this time- and I was almost begging the guy to just give me my money back and let me get out of there. He started the "restocking fee" b.s . on me even though the sign in the store clearly stated no restocking on items that were defective. I guess he had to prove to himself and me that the unit WAS defective as he spent the better part of an hour trying to find a reset button or some way to get the unit to power on. Having been in the store and their parking lot almost 4 hours by that time- he managed to ge the unit open and found a reset button. I ended up taking the unit- was rather surprised that no one even acknowledged that I spent 4 hours dealing with this ordeal, not one mention of any compensation, nothing but the salesman talking about "might have to charge you a restocking fee" it was all about not wanting to take anything back and hanging this "restocking fee" over my head even though the unit clearly didn't work.. The next 3 days I spent frustrated with the unit- it would power off an on as if it were haunted. It would work for 1/2 hour then suddenly reboot itself- and almost do a reformat- making me re-enter all my information. I had enough and clearly thought something had to be wrong with the design or something - with this new Tom Tom 910. I returned to Best Buy (but one closer to my house) and spent over an hour almost defending myself with a salesman and a store manager- as they kept talking about "not wanting to charge me a restocking fee" they called other stores trying to find me another unit. I kept insisting I was done with it- I didnt' want another unit- and that I thought in weeks to come we'd hear about a bug or something in these new devices from Tom Tom. Reluctantly I agreed to go to yet another store- 60 miles of driving- to get another unit as the store I was in did not have any in stock. They said if I did not go to this other store to get a replacement unit they would have to charge me a restocking fee- even though the saw that the unit was clearly defective.. I went home to have dinner and thinking all of this over- I returned to that same Best Buy and basically demanded that they just refund my money- or at least ship me a replacement unit- I did NOT want to drive 60 miles to get a 3rd unit.... they agreed - and at the returns counter I spent another hour waiting in line to get a refund. It wasn't till I left the store that I noticed they did in fact charge me over 150.00 restocking fee. So I returned to Best Buy and the returns counter guy said their systems are pre-set to automatically always charge a restocking fee- he had forgotten to change that on my return.. Of course now I am seeing on line that LOTS of folks have had problems with these new units- sad that Tom Tomreally messed up with this 910.... they must have rushed to get them to market without having anyone test the unit?? Who knows- but I will NEVER NEVER return to Best Buy- I had the misfortune of spending almost 6 hours in THREE different Best Buy Stores regarding this Tom Tom ordeal- and consistantly I was treated as if I had done something wrong- each person pushed me to the wall with this restocking fee- and even trying to sell me an extended warranty- even though the unit was only an hour old- I will never shop with Best Buy again. I might get another Tom tom but only after they figure out a way to fix this problem with the 910. I really lliked the Tom Tom 700 and wish I had kept that unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it worked, it performed as promised. But after 8 mos, the machine became buggy and then completely failed not giving out directions or defaulting to a foreign country.. 
Cons:. If somethg goes wrong, dealing with Tom Tom customer support is infuriating. You need to reserve 1-2 hours of your day to talk thry useless fixes and they make it impossible to contact them via email -- no easy support email or return policy.. 
Summary:. I will never buy Tom Tom again and could not recommend this product in good faith to anyone because if you get a defective machine, you will be tormented in your attempts to get it repaired. Worst yet, if you are outside the warranty period, you simply are out of luck (and $500) because they won't repair it even if you try to pay for repairs. Just toss your machine in the garbage.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great interface, great text to speech. 
Cons:. Totally unstable software/hardware. 
Summary:. I bought this TomTom and loved it for a few days. But, when I tried to connect it up to my laptop to update the maps (my office address wasn't in the default maps) it froze and would never turn on again, even when doing a hard reset. I work in technology so I was very careful about following the documented process. Huge disappointment.. Coincidentally my office bought two TomToms for us to use. After a few weeks BOTH of them had stopped working with exactly the same symptoms. Totally amazing how unstable they are. It's a shame, as it could be such a great product.. 

$$;
Pros:. None that I can see. 
Cons:. Expensive. Not very reliable. 
Summary:. When I got this it did not work right out of the box. Had to use a pin to reset it, this was not mentioned in the manual, had to search the net to find the resolution to this common problem. It worked well for awhile. Now it shuts off every 10 minutes and you have to re enter your destination and start over. I have used the TomTom site to report my problems via email 3 times over the past 4 months, I have never recieved an answer. I am going to try calling them today.. This is my first &#38; Last Tom Tom product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice interface - lousy support. 
Cons:. No support for bugs, just buy $oftware/map updates. 
Summary:. I purchased a TomTom for my spouse in September 2007 - Used it three times. When it automaticlly selects a route it said that unpaved roads were part of the route, even though they weren't - contacted support and they informed me that an updated map is available for download for $79 and this will fix my problem - This is the answer to fix my problem - spend more money and hope I don't have another bug or that this will fix the bug I do have. FYI the new street/road on any of the routes is 8 years old.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of Bugs / Hard to Reset as well... 
Cons:. Battery and Bad Experience. 
Summary:. First unit purchased from Circuit City was returned as 2 days after purchased the unit would not turn on. Second Unit exchanged and same issue after 30 or so days and only 2 days of usage. Unit sent to TomTom to get RMA and fixed and returned. After one day of usage and address entry following/next day after a full charge unit will not come on. Reset did not work, I am on the phone with them and refuse to have this unit fixed again as UPS costs 15$/shipping a pop and running a company that we must have GPS units I was forced to purchase another unit, use it for 10-14 days while my unit would be fixed and pay another $45.00 dollars for a restocking fee for the backup unit. Bad experience and will never buy another TomTom. I will refuse to pay another shipping to TOMTOM. I am looking for their corporate address to instead of pay another restocking fee to open a 30$ small claims case against them.. 

$$;
Pros:. No problems with navigation or display. 
Cons:. Difficult mount, Cheap Mount, Broken Mount, Stupid Mount. 
Summary:. I won't spend time discussing anything other than the mount on this system. Totally difficult to attach GPS to the mount, illogical as the charger does not connect to the GPS unit, it attachs to via the mount. That presents a problem as we are now on our second replacement due to mechanical breakage in less than 12 months.. Breakage is not due to mis-use or frustration for which could be expected. The quality of the mount is soooooooooo cheap and poorly engineered it eliminates any need to espouse on the benefits of the GPS unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice screen, good options, simple menus. 
Cons:. Machine conks out sporadically. 
Summary:. We got this for the US and Europe maps, nice screen, and was told this was the topline GPS. However, ownership has been crippled with multiple returns to BestBuy because it decides to "stop working." This has happened now 6 times. Not kidding. My last machine worked pretty well for 5 months and finally gave out. We switched to Garmin.. 

$$;
Pros:. nothin.. everything is pathetic in buydig.com. 
Cons:. pathetic customer service -- bate and switch. 
Summary:. ...NEVA BUY ANYTHING FROM BUYDIG.... y'day nite da TOM TOM 910 GPS was listed for $431.49 checked CNET, Pricegrabber and Sleek deals to confirm it. ordered it. Got confirmation. also recieved another email sayin order is in process. Then recieved a call from customer service saying that by mistake it was wrongly listed. now they offer me the GPS for $400!! the manager was very rude and was not ready to listen anything eventhough they were at fault. They threatened me that they will cancel the order and I could take any legal action if I want. What pathetic service. First they are at fault. they let customer place order, then say they are now offering for 400 and the manager was the rudest i ever talked. Her extension was 553/524. I hope her supervisor sees tis review n teach her how to speak wid customers. I advice you guys not to believe in any of their deals as in most cases they will back off and cancel it. BTW do u guys know any legal action i can take... harsh.shah@yahoo.com. 

$$;
Pros:. very few, good mp3 player. 
Cons:. terrible customer service, navigation system VERY inaccurate. 
Summary:. IN the 5 months I have my 910 there have been nothing but probles; customer service people very ill trained, waiting time on the phone exceeds 20 minutes. Unit shipped back as voice saying "you have arrived" off by as much as 500 feet. It is very poor. I would not recomment this unit to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large POI database, excellent graphics, large disk. 
Cons:. The mount, clumsy format. 
Summary:. The mount of this unit is no less than a catastrophe. The GPS unit is heavy, and the mount arm is thin, so the whole thing becomes very shaky when you drive. The power transfer through the mount suffers from bad contact, and more than once I experienced that the unit shut down when driving. The final event, when I drove in Italy (it was 38 degrees Celcius outside the car), was that the suction cup fell off the rest of the mount, so that the unit fell down on the dashboard! The rest of the trip, the unit had to rest in glove compartment! It is a shame that such a fine piece (excellent receiver and graphics, good maps, nice user interface) should be equipped with such an inferior mount!. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth worked well. 
Cons:. Too many bugs to list. 
Summary:. First one I bought wouldn't turn on. Second one had a loose connection between the window mount and the unit itself. The power plugs into the window mount and not directly into the unit so when you swivel the display it can cause a loose connection (bad engineering) Third and final one had a bad LCD display and would intermittently go dark. Either give TomTom time to get this right or by something else, the first batch are bad.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nothing really.. 
Cons:. I used this a few times over a year - there were always issues with it shutting down at random times despite a fully charged battery. It is VERY slow, and loses satellite signals constantly. Now it just freezes and restarts. No longer works.. 
Summary:. This product is the worst. I am extremely dissatisfied and I can't believe a company would charge me what it did for such a bad quality piece of crap. I wish I would have bought a Garmin. I will never buy tomtom again and I will tell everyone I know to avoid this product. This is the worst piece of electronic equipment I have ever come into contact with. I am debating on throwing it out of my 2-story window and busting it to pieces with a hammer, just for sport.. 

$$;
Pros:. I liked my first TomTom but sold it right away to get the new 910. I used the 910 about 4 times in 1 year and now it only turns on to display a wallpaper &#38; wouldn't work beyond that or even turn off. Found reviews on that problem but it's too late.. 
Cons:. Accurate but not perfect; touch-screen is good; user-friendly.. 
Summary:. I've only used 2 TomToms and no other GPS brands. I really liked the 300(?) because I never had problems with it although I wanted to get a bigger screen that's why I got the 910. Had I read the reviews before buying the 910, I would've stuck with the 300. Oh wait, I did buy a Magellan but I returned it the following day because I got dizzy using it due to its instability. The mount was substandard compared to the TomTom. I like the TomTom's mount on the 300 but the 910 is a little hard to operate because it keeps bowing down. Another frustration is the RESET button. I couldn't find it so I referred to the online guide and found out that it's hidden way in the back, and inside. I'm a tech person and I didn't find it or recognized it. It's not like a RESET button is a confidential code that people might steal, so it was very unnecessary to put it in the spot where it was. Besides, what frustrates me is that obviously, the reset button is useless if your unit doesn't have power which is a problem with mine - it doesn't charge anymore. So, to reset it, I have to keep it plugged in. Well, that's impossible because it's located inside where you'll have to remove it from its port to reach it. The port is the power supplier, so how am I supposed to reset it with power?!? They could've easily put it underneath but no, they had to put it inside where it's blocked. Next time I buy a GPS, it won't be a TomTom. I'll also advise my friends to look for other brands because it seems like they didn't think it all through before they released it.. 

$$;
Pros:. POWERS UP SOMETIMES. 
Cons:. BAD DOWNLOADS, MAPS, BLUETOOTH, SUPPORT, CUSTOMER CARE, ROUTING.... 
Summary:. MY OPINION OF TOMTOM IS THAT IF THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY, WHO CARES.. 

$$;
Pros:. great features and very useful and precise. 
Cons:. dies constantly. 
Summary:. Fine product in the terms of features and capabilities...however, the dumb thing dies out on my every two/three month...this is my second one that just won't turn on no matter if it's plugged in to the wall or connected to the computer.. screen just wouldn't come on. I'm guessing either the screen or hard drive is dead. I mean they don't put any vents and that thing has a full blown hard drive and NO COOLING!!!. in any case it is going back tomorrow to office depot for the second time. And I am taking my full money back.... 

$$;
Pros:. Clear Audio. 
Cons:. Can not get all address/road directions. 
Summary:. I purchased the TomTom GO 910 December 9, 2006. It worked all right in some cities and towns except for a lot of the address's could not be found, so back to the maps I went! The TomTom was completely updated too. February 12, 2007 it stopped working, the blank screen came up and the unit got so hot I had to use a rag to unplug and dismount it. I took it back to place of purchase and they gave me a replacement, I plugged it in to my truck just to make sure it worked, it came on so I thought it worked. This morning I went to set it up for todays route and it does not work!! The blank screen is the only thing that came on and it is still on!! It will not shut off or come on, absolutely nothing!! I will be taking it back today and get my $700.00 that I paid for it! I bought it for my business truck and half the time it was useless and it kept falling off the windshield. Overall this product is not worth buying for the price that is charged for it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. It's now dead after 3 uses and nothing heard from TomTom...?. 
Summary:. A new product that was easy to use straight from the box.. On my 3rd use while i'm on holidays its now failing to turn on and appears to be dead. I have attempted to contact TomTom for a bit of urgent help but so far we haven't been in touch. A driving holiday that has the added burden of following maps. Watch this space as i travel and see what their after sales service is like, (I'd rather not know to be honest).. 

$$;
Pros:. great if you plan to use only twice. 
Cons:. Shoddy craftsmanship and customer service. 
Summary:. I recently bought this product and after only two uses it fell apart. The screen froze and the unit could not be turned off, thus it overheated causing the screen to crack. To make matters worse, the company does not replace their defective merchandise and charges an additional $500 to fix the problem. So if you've got money to throw away and want to invest in a product that even its own producers won't stand by, than by all means buy this product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good Bluetooth for your phone.

Pros:. Buy a Garmin. 
Cons:. Bad LCD display-The mounting system-old maps-connection GPS and moore. 
Summary:. I had this unit only 2 days and took it back.. I was the previous owner of a Garmin 2720 and prepared to buy a new GPS ,. I decided to buy the 910.. I purchased my TomTom Go 910. The first trip&.. We got lost! It brought Me in a dead street ( 20 miles Trip because the maps are very old and poor descriptions -lots of unknown street name  no plaza name). The mount for the windshield is awful, do not hold the unit, then the screen will face down toward the dash...making it very hard to see. I had to mount it so the unit touched the dashboard.. When I used in-car on a bright sunny day ( every day were I live Florida) You. can not see the display (bad LCD display).. Customer service???????. If you are looking for a Bluetooth for your phone, buy a Tom Tom go 910.. If you are looking for a serious Navigation System buy a Garmin..

Pros:. BlueTooth speakerphone works well with cell phone.. 
Cons:. Does not receive GPS signal half the time, especially when plugged into power. Extremely unreliable. Slow to power on. Tells you to turn at slight curves in road.. 
Summary:. When it worked, I got where I wanted to go, but it worked less than half the time. This is the biggest gadget disappointment I can remember. It was worse than useless on the trip I bought it for, and it was downright embarrassing when a passenger was in the car and I told him I didn't directions because I had this great new GPS navigator, then it would fail to work. Also, it is very difficult to get it onto and off of the various stands it comes with, and the car mount does not work at all for my car (BMW) or the rental car I had recently (Sebring). Do not pay $800 to be another beta tester!.
