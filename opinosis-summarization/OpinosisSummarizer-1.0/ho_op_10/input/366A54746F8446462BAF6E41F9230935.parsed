on/IN leaving/VBG ,/, i/FW again/RB did/VBD n't/RB say/VB that/IN we/PRP had/VBD got/VBN engaged/VBN ,/, but/CC explained/VBD the/DT farce/NN of/IN getting/VBG a/DT bottle/NN of/IN wine/NN that/WDT was/VBD supposed/VBN to/TO be/VB there/RB in/IN the/DT first/JJ place/NN ./.

however/RB ,/, whether/IN i/FW take/VB the/DT hotel/NN up/RP on/IN their/PRP$ offer/NN of/IN a/DT free/JJ upgrade/NN is/VBZ yet/RB to/TO be/VB seen/VBN !/.

the/DT room/NN was/VBD excellent/JJ though/RB ,/, although/IN i/FW can/MD not/RB understand/VB why/WRB there/EX would/MD be/VB a/DT flat-screen/JJ television/NN with/IN terrible/JJ reception/NN on/IN it/PRP in/IN a/DT plush/JJ room/NN !/.

luckily/RB ,/, the/DT hotel/NN on/IN this/DT occasion/NN was/VBD not/RB going/VBG to/TO impact/NN on/IN a/DT romantic/JJ meal/NN ,/, shakespeare/NN play/NN ,/, and/CC some/DT songs/NNS sung/VBN with/IN the/DT help/NN of/IN the/DT guitar/NN .../: i/FW did/VBD n't/RB think/VB anything/NN of/IN it/PRP ,/, but/CC emailed/VBD back/RB to/TO ask/VB how/WRB much/JJ a/DT bottle/NN of/IN champagne/NN would/MD be/VB in/IN the/DT room/upgrade/NN to/TO a/DT suite/NN etc/NN ./.

i/LS do/VBP n't/RB believe/VB in/IN telling/VBG a/DT hotel/NN that/IN you/PRP are/VBP going/VBG there/RB with/IN the/DT purpose/NN of/IN proposing/VBG ,/, there/EX should/MD be/VB good/JJ service/NN at/IN a/DT 4-star/JJ hotel/NN whatever/WDT .../: as/IN i/FW had/VBD originally/RB booked/VBN with/IN laterooms/NNS -LRB-/-LRB- with/IN a/DT bottle/NN of/IN wine/NN in/IN room/NN on/IN arrival/NN -RRB-/-RRB- ,/, i/FW noticed/VBN afterwards/RB on/IN their/PRP$ official/JJ website/NN that/IN they/PRP did/VBD a/DT romantic/JJ package/NN ./.

i/LS proceded/VBD to/TO walk/VB to/TO the/DT restaurant/NN and/CC eventually/RB ended/VBD up/RP in/IN the/DT kitchen/NN and/CC found/VBD a/DT chef/NN who/WP exchanged/VBD it/PRP for/IN a/DT bottle/NN of/IN white/JJ ./.

pool/NN freezing/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT sauna/NN was/VBD not/RB on/IN and/CC had/VBD to/TO wait/VB for/IN it/PRP to/TO warm/VB up/RP .../: upon/IN arrival/NN ,/, the/DT staff/NN were/VBD ok/JJ ,/, but/CC not/RB very/RB welcoming/JJ ,/, and/CC when/WRB we/PRP went/VBD up/RB to/TO the/DT room/NN ,/, there/EX was/VBD only/RB one/CD towel/NN and/CC no/DT wine/NN ./.

the/DT response/NN was/VBD that/IN i/FW needed/VBN to/TO make/VB a/DT new/JJ booking/NN ,/, hence/RB paying/VBG to/TO cancel/VB the/DT laterooms/NNS booking/VBG ./.

that/DT was/VBD quite/RB annoying/JJ ,/, as/IN i/FW wasted/VBD a/DT lot/NN of/IN time/NN going/VBG up/RB and/CC down/RB ,/, up/RB and/CC down/RB ./.

i/LS noticed/VBD a/DT filled/VBN in/IN questionaire/NN left/VBN by/IN the/DT previous/JJ guests/NNS in/IN our/PRP$ room/NN ,/, stating/VBG a/DT similar/JJ poor/JJ view/NN of/IN staff/NN ./.
