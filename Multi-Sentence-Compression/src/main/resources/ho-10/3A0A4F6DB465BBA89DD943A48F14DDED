the 1 bedroom unit was right on the golf course , had large patio doors in both the bedroom and the main area , with screens that had locking mechanisms , or so we thought .
resort security knew that the screen doors , while they had locks on them , didn’t actually work as they didn’t engage the locking mechanism ( although it felt like it had to me .
the desert springs villas ( marriott vacation club ) has always been a favorite destination for us and we have stayed there five times !
while eating at the dining table , person or persons unknown entered the suite thru the bedroom patio door stealing my jewelry and blackberry left in the room .
don’t open your patio doors ( even if you are in the room !
they also noted no forcible entry , footprints in the mud outside the door and lifted a finger print , not ours , from the screen door handle .
if the thief had been seen and confronted , we might have lost a lot more than some jewelry .
one evening around 7 pm , the weather was beautiful so we opened the glass patio doors , leaving the screen doors closed and presumed locked .
however , during our last stay in october , 2010 , we suffered a “home invasion” type theft while we were present in the unit ! ! !
a locking screen door can provide a deterrent especially if occupants are present in the room at the time .
