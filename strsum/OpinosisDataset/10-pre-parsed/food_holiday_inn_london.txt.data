minimall with boots pharmacy, whole foods type ritzy fullservice market, coffee shops, etc .

stunning food, amazing service .

food drink a little pricey in local establishments .

one local restaurant stood out for having excellent food,  olives  located one block away .

food was ok, service very haphazard .

food in pub is excellent value .

food is overpriced everywhere due to $ to pound conversion of course .

food quality was good, service prompt, everything prepared as we had ordered .

food was expensive, but that is true all over london just now .

but it's great value for money, great location, pleasant staff, good food, and we'll be staying there again .
