i did a lot of reserach before buying this camcorder  .
minidv vs dvd , true 16  9 vs 4  3 , 1ccd vs 3ccd (affordable) , i looked at it all  .
it took me 2 months to finally decide minidv is the best format performance    wise (best picture) and support    wise ( video editing software) so i purchased the dcr    hc90  .
i looked at the panasonic pv    gs250 3ccd vs the hc90 and when low    light performance and a 16  9 viewing area were factored in , the decision is easy i will admit , i tried the cheaper route at first going with the dcr    hc42 , but the smaller ccd made low light performance dismal at best (lots of blue haze)  .
i returned it the next day and ordered the hc    90 if you are looking for a minidv video camera with excellent low    light performance and 16  9 , do not waste your time with anything else .
the sony dcr    hc90 is a beautiful machine  .
i absolutely love it  .
widescreen is a major plus (absolutely beautiful on a widescreen hdtv) or when you're filming 3  4 it's still seamless  .
i have an apple powerbook and i have gone through cameras that have choppy , digital , or just plain gross footage  .
the sony dcr    hc90 is absolutely amazing  .
without a doubt the best  .
ok first , i'd like to say that i have awarded this a 10 because i feel that the average should be higher than a 9 second , i would like to say that this is by far the worst review i have ever seen on cnet and i have been a customer of cnet for quite some time i believe that the reviewer completely overlooked the full package that this camcorder entails  .
if more time is spent with this camcorder , it would definetely have received a higher score  .
especially when this camcorder was not compared to the pc350 , which scored an 8  .
this camcorder is exactly like the pc350 internally , with a different form factor , and no manual focus ring  .
so for a complete , and accurate review , please check out the pc350's review this camera surpasses the pc350 as it provides better utilization of 16  9 format , allowing 30p mode to be recorded in widescreen here is a list of features compared to the pc350 posted by oscarx in another forums , which basically sums it all up    .
hc90 has a widescreen lcd  .
hc90 has a dedicated button to switch recording between wide and 4  3  .
hc90 can set video output to be widescreen tv or 4  3 tv  .
that means you can always record in wide (true widescreen compressed is recordedand on tape) and you can play it back as full widescreen on 16  9 tv or letterboxed on 4  3 tv through the video output    hc90 has automatic lens cover that closes when camera is off  .
hc90 has small mirror on the lcd hinge so people can see themselves  .
hc90 has no manual focus ring  .
hc90 has no title or tape name functions  .
hc90 uses thin a batteries and there are only 2 capacities available while pc350 uses ff bateries and there are 4 capacities including the super    large ff71  .
hc90 is cheaper  .
hc90 seems smaller  .
hc90 has 5  .
1 dolby digital ability  .
to sum it all up   look at user reviews over the cnet review (at least for this camcorder)  .
i did a lot of research  .
i even bought a panasonic gs250 , but took it back and ate the restocking fee from circut city when i found the dcr    hc90 this is the most satisfied i have ever been with any electronic gadget  .
still photos are excellent and flash works great  .
i guess the flash could be further from the lens so if i use a wide angle lens it wo not interfere , but no big deal sometimes it is slow to focus , but only in low light and you can zoom in and out a little to force it to focus quicker finally , a true hybrid of video and stills  .
i researched this camera all year , reading other user opinions and asking around until i is completely satisfied i almost bought a tapeless jvc but since the technology is still early i is hesitant i bought a firewire , extra battery , 512 card for photos and a 3 year warranty  .
go to a sony store for all your questions , cause some box store employees do not know the difference between a dishwasher to a camcorder i have adobe elements , but used windows movie maker and then made dvd's with ulead .
i am very glad i bought this camcorder , it has so many capabilities and features , it is able to record a movie on the memory sick in mpeg format or on tape that can be downloaded to a pc in avi format  .
it is also a very good camera for regular point and shoot type of photos  .
i like recording using the infra red feature for very dark places reading the manual to learn how to use this camcorder for advanced features is a task , the manual refers to the other manual on the cd i highly recommend this camcorder .
i returned a 30 gb jvc hard drive camcoder because the video quality is terrible day or night recording  .
so i research extensively and i decided to go with the sony dcr    hc90 for it's features and size  .
the 16 x 9 is a seller too  .
price is reasonable and looks were quite nice  .
once i put it to use , i is very impressed with the video recording quality and the still images were not bad at all  .
the stabilizer is very accurate and aleved my worries of buying a small palm size cam for steady shots and the record and zoom buttons on the lcd help keeping the cam steadier  .
lcd onscreen touch buttons are nice , but dirty the lcd with your finger oils , so i carry a small lens cloth to keep it clean  .
last but not least , charging the battery while in the camera is a bit silly , but convenient to reduce caring charges (especially when you leave them behind in hotel rooms yikes  .
they should make them with a small retractable cord if they really want to imrove convenience though)  .
but they do sell an external charger  .
overall , i highly recommend it and the price is right  .
oh it works great with pc and mac  .
i'm the kind of geek who reads all the blurb before spending my money and did all the research before picking the sony dcr    hc90  .
it's the perfect camcorder to get started with the easy user option making it childs play from day one  .
moving on to bigger and better projects , the extra features make this a serious camcorder for the amateur  .
sure , it's not a pro model , but for everything i could ask of a camcorder , its perfect .
i really trust cnet for reviews of products but they missed the mark on this one  .
the indoor quality of this camera is so amazing , i cannot believe it  .
and i read several reviews telling how small this camera is and still didn't get it , its smaller than my fuji s7000 digital camera also i have hooked this up to my mac without any problems unlike some reviewers out there i also think that the reviews of the akward controls is off the mark as well  .
i have not used many camcorders , but the touch screen controls are very easy to use for me this camera is everything that i have been waiting for in a digital camcorder , so i gave it a 9 (do not think anything is ever a 10 , there is always room for improvement)  .
check around you can get this camera for a really great price , and buy yourself some extra batteries , you will need them  .
i have been using generics that i picked up for $15 each and have experienced no problems good luck in your choice of a camcorder , its a big decision and with so many choices and opinions out there it can be tough to bite the bullet and choose  .
i researched this camera for months and the review here helped me  .
i just hope that my little review will help someone else .
i am writing this review to correct an impression left by another reviewer  .
this camera does work with a mac i feel that the cnet reviewer rated this camcorder too low  .
true , it's manual controls probably would not satisfy a real camera nut  .
however , for most users it is a great camera  .
it produces great video , has excellent automatic controls , and is very easy to use  .
i particularly like the touch screen controls and the ease of use enhanced by the p    menu (personal menu) concept  .
in my view , the folks at sony have produced a camera with great performance and an excellent user interface  .
professional results i is worried about low light performance was able to get three cameras side by side in a trial from my dealer the supposed better panasonic    canon    and then the sony in a dark dinning situation where a single candle at each table is all the light , the sony blew the others two away it is not even close bought the sony , put a protective lens on it and off on vacation  .
i put all the still camera's away and did my entire vacation with the sony in 16  9 it is a beach vacation so everything is there bright sun glare reflections lowlight fireworks and on and on when i got home i used pinnacle studio plus to capture the dv  .
i pulled stills out of the motion video and they were perfect i did the editing , add wipes , lead in titles and music with pinnacle , burned it off to a 720 x 480 dvd and is shocked at the quality  .
perfect and very professional  .
lcd is easy to read on the beach menu system is very good once you read the manual learning curve is short , about 1  .
hours one sunday morning then a 30 minute smoke test of the sonys features and i is ready  .
i imagine the other corders are all are pretty equal with minor differences , but the low light performance of the sony sold me 100% , and really no performance aspect of the unit let me down i'm happy and have the dvd's to prove it  .

com  .
love this camera with all my heart  .
no battery popping out from the back good video quality and low light too  .
16  9 display  .
awesome overaalll  .
highly recommended .
find this camcorder a pleasure to use  .
tested indoors in regular and low lighting with extreem zooming (in and out)with no difficulties focusing , outdoors same results  .
colors are spectacular  .
for someone who wants to shoot great video this is an incredible camcorder  .
shooting underwater with underwater with ikelite housing delivered outstanding results , even in low light  .
now if sony could only bring the still pix quality and resolution up to the level of there p150 or better .
i shoot 75    85% of my videos indoors  .
good recordings in natural light are very important for me  .
i also like taking candid videos  .
my camcorder must be quick to startup and remain unotrusive when hanging at my side  .
no lens cap helps too  .
auto    focus and auto    exposure are essential  .
i cannot be fiddling with settings while my subjects wait and stare  .
the dcr    hc90 does the job  .
it meets all of my quirky requirements the anamorphic 16  9 mode is great  .
it loads flawlessly into premier pro where i do all my post work  .
even though most of my videos are shown on 4  3 screens , 16  9 gives a wide    field view that i now prefer  .
i'm shooting everything in 16  9 at maximum sd resolution  .
yeah  .
i wish the hc90 had optical stabilization and expandable batteries  .
sony's digital stabilization is good enough    but optical would improve resolution  .
also the prices is too high  .
but then again this camera is unique in the 1ccd world so i have litle choice but to pay i had the panasonic pv    gs250 and returned it to buy the hc90 (for the same price  .
the 3 ccds in the panasonic were marginally better in sunlight (better reds and blues) ; but indoors the panasonic is hopelessly outclassed (virtually black and white all the time    i expected better)  .
3ccds are good    but only if you shoot outside some reviewers say the sony touch screen is an issue  .
i really , really like it  .
here's why   i am 40 years old  .
my eyes are beginning to suffer up close  .
i can see the sony's big backlit lcd buttons in the dark or indoors  .
other camcorders    with tiny hard buttons    are a real challenge    for nearly blind middle age types like me .
this really stylish    looking camera fits in the palm of your hand and does it all  .
it produces great video and surprisingly good digital pictures  .
it is a full    featured camera with a flash , exposure control , ae programs , spot metering , white balance , and more  .
no more lugging a video camera and a digital camera to our kids events if you have a 16  9 tv , this camera is a must    have  .
the lcd screen is 16  9 , and it is really easy to choose between the two modes if you already have a sony digital camera and are planning to use your memory stick in this , think again  .
this takes memory stick duo , which is thinner than memory stick  .
there is an adapter where you can use the duos with a camera that takes the regular memory stick , but it still means you will have to buy more memory  .
it only comes with a 16mb stick , which is all you need if you wont be taking many pictures with the camera  .
with a 256mb card you can get 150 pictures overall , this camera is nothing short of awesome  .
it is well worth the price and highly recommended .
i love this item  .
i really really do  .
what more can you ask for  .
the item itself is very affordable , it's dependable , gives you a very beautiful picture , crisp sound , it's nice and compact and it really is not heavy  .
oh i love it  .
i purchased this item strictly for my vacation that just passed (i went to south beach miami for memorial day weekend  .
) you can only imagine what i is able to catch on tape  .
(smiling  .
) i recorded a majority of my footage during the night and i must say that this camcorder held it's own in the low lighting without the usage of a built    in light  .
my only complaint is the battery  .
a fully charged battery will pretty much provide 35 minutes of record time  .
that stinks  .
my recommendation is that when and if you purchase this camcorder , make sure you also purchase the npfa    70 lithum ion battery as a back up  .
it's a 5 hour plus battery and it has more than enough juice to record everything  .
i have used 3 different dv cameras  .
this one is by far the best  .
the low light performance is second to none (in its price range) it has a decent amount of manual controls although many of them are buried pretty deep in the menu tree the menu system is relatively intuative although you will need to read the manual to understand sony's naming scheme for some of the items the steady    shot works amazingly thanks to the extra pixels available in the large (1/3 ) ccd overall a highly reccomended unit  .
i looked at the panasonic gs250 , canon optura , and the sony hc90  .
i wanted to like the panasonic enought to buy it , but the sony is just a better package  .
and it had true 16  9 with a 16  9 lcd , an important factor for me the hc90 is just an elegant package  .
after using the hc90 for a while and editing 16  9 video in adobe premiere elements , i'm convinced i make the right decision  .
it's just the right size and feels great in hand  .
the controls are well laid out and easy  .
the video quality is great  .
photo quality is very good for a camcorder  .
16  9 works great  .
and there are enough prosumer features to satisfy me the only thing i do not like is having to buy and use a memory stick and other sony propietary stuff when all my other devices use standard sd , etc .
other than the personal experiences of users , like me , who rate this little machine as excellent , the criticisms i've seen re  .
this camcorder relate to a) autofocus problems , b)video quality and c)menu/manual focus issues  .
i've fiddled with many camcorders in my time , and i don't have any issues in these areas  .
but i have not worked with every machine out there  .
fact is , i'm very happy with this little devil , and i know i'll use it in many applications because of it's convenient size coupled with great audio/video quality .
cnet really dropped the ball on this one  .
the hc90 is actually an improved pc    350 , with the same lens and ccd i love my hc90  .
i held many other camcorders in my hand  .
they all feel like play toys compared to this one 1  .
you can personalize the menus so that they are fast and easy  .
no need to enter the rolling menus as the reviewer said 2  .
easy mode locks out all of the manual setting and makes the touch screen buttons bigger  .
my grandma can take brilliant footage with this machine using the easy mode  .
contrary to the reviewers remarks 3  .
i have never had a focus problem  .
i have had it seek for focus in almost total darkeness when using the zoom but the 3ccd camcorders were totally useless in this situation  .
contrary to the reviewers remarks  .
i have also filmed windsurfers and soccer matches and there is no focus issue  .
the camcorder is like greased lightning 4  .
it plays back perfectly on all aspect ration tv's  .
contrary to the reviewers remarks  .
there is a setting in the camcorder for which type of tv you play back on 5  .
there is a sports ae  .
contrary to the reviewers remarks i do not know if the reviewer has been hitting the crack pipe but he is wrong  .
way wrong this camcorder has good progressive recording as well  .
something that the top consumer 3ccd camcorders do not have  .
it has a massive ccd and wide screen playback is absolutely stunning  .
almost looks hd trust me and the other people who own this camcorder who have posted here  .
this camcorder is top notch  .
it makes the pv    gs250 look bad .
i've been keeping track of this camcorder for a few months now    reading user and professional reviews when they appear  .
i always liked what i saw (and read)  .
so , when i got the go    ahead , i purchased this camcorder  .
after using it and finding myself amazed every time , i'm stunned to read this review (or at least the score)  .
i agree , in some regard , with a couple of points    but they are basically nullified when you change a couple of things  .
for example , they mentioned the difficulty using the menus for manual controls  .
i too found this to be a little irritating to begin with  .
but once i customized the menu to my tastes (which you can do) , i had no problem  .
other things like autofocus problems i don't get it  .
i have not had a single problem with the focus , even when zooming in on a pond that's behind a lot of trees (which would , in my opinion , cause the focus to have trouble) i guess i'll just have to agree to disagree with cnet (which is a shame , because they're usually so right    on ) .
i waited and waited for cnet to review this camcorder before ordering one but gave up and just did it  .
i is disappointed cnet took as long as they did to finally publish a review  .
looking at the specs and features this one had , i had to just order it  .
i received it and am just speechless  .
the majority of the user reviews have this one down tight  .
cnet , however , also disappointed me with their abysmal review i will definetely give the user reviews more weight than one or a few editors in the future when it comes to purchasing decisions  .
shame on you cnet , this camcorder is rock solid  .
i also is surprised at the cnet rating on this camera  .
i reviewed dozens of cameras before deciding on the hc90 others i narrowed down to were the panasonic gs250 (3ccd) , sony dcr    pc350 and canon optura 60  .
i went with the hc90 after much research for a number of reasons , many of which are personal preference  .
1) panasonic gs250 is not as compact as i would like and 3ccd didn't seem any better than large single ccd on hc90  .
2) sony dcr    pc350  .
this is mainly form factor , prefer the horizontal grip vs  .
vetical and didn't feel it offered enough over hc90 to justify another couple hundred bucks  .
3) optura 60    good camera , but low light on the sony beat this out  .
true the nightshot gives a more monochrome image , but it is not slow shutter and it records in total darkness have had the camera a week and am thus far very impressed , although still very early in my evaluation  .
i will say the 3mp still images are not anywhere near what you will get with a good quality digital camera , but they are okay  .
my old 3mp olympus c    3040z (6 years old) takes much better pictures but that is also a very good image even comapred to some of my newer cameras this is my first sony camcorder (replaced a jvc) and the touch screen menu can be a little annoying as others have mentioned , but here is where personal preference really played in  .
i am a very avid digital video and still guy , i do quite a bit of video editing on a mac to produce dvd's for personal use  .
the truth is that although i would like to think i would use more manual controls , i do not  .
in the end my choice needed to be compact to take everywhere and deliver high    quality video in standard mode (turn it on and let it work)  .
for those requirements , this is an excellent choice accessories i bought    .
larger memory stick  .
longer    life battery  .
travel charger for battery  .
lens filter  .
i is shocked to see such a low score on review  .
i bought my dcr    hc90 about a week ago and the camera is just great  .
awesome sound and video quality , great image stabilizer  .
i definitely recommend this product .
overall this camcorder is an exceptional buy  .
it has plenty of manual control for those people who like to have complete control over the situation they are filming  .
it also has an easy button which makes it easy to use for anybody  .
the quality of the images and the sound are great  .
it is unfortunate that cnet gave it such a mediocre score  .
however , if you read through the review it is actually pretty complimentary  .
i would not hesitate to buy this camcorder again  .
i really love this camcorder  .
i have to disagree on the low score cnet gave this unit  .
i think the cnet reviewer overlooked the customizable menus that allow for some of the best menu functionality i have ever seen in a camcorder  .
i also have not seen the issue of slow focus  .
i think this it the easiest point and shoot camcorder to use once a little time is put into setting up the personalized menu  .
not to mention the easey button which takes all of the headaches out of good video  .
as far as picture/video qulity goes this cam is right there with the 3ccd cams possibly a little better in some situations and in my opinion much easier to use for the non enthusiest  .
low light performance is stellar for theis class  .
as far as a lack of a focus ring being a concern i find the spot focus feature much quicker and more user friendly than a manual focus ring  .
i'm extremely happy with my purchase after trying several other cams in this price range  .
one last thing , i find the still picture quality to be as good or better than my 3  .
0 megpixel kodak still cam  .
i really like the burst modes for rapid fire picture taking without flash  .
i would have given the cam a 10 if it came with a larger memory card for the stills  .
your milage may vary .
this is my first camcorder , and i could not be happier  .
for someone like me , i is looking for a camera that i can use for special events and trips , as well as a feature with a digital camera so as to minimize the amount of things to carry  .
with the dcr    hc90 i've got that  .
i used at a friend's wedding this past week    end , phenomal footage  .
and the digital pics came out so clean ; people at the reception were shocked  .
now that's my kinda cam , one that people are jealous about .
i got my hc    90 2 days ago i did quite a bit of homework before purchasing the hc    90  .
i wanted high quality dv in a 16  9 format  .
i own a 42 sony lcd hdtv and i wanted sharp , high quality performance other factors for me   solid build (exterior) , and good quality parts (interior)  .
firewire , size , ease of use , minidv , and price things that i got but didn't expect    .
size    when the package arrived , i is surprised at the size of the box it came in  .
it is small  .
when i opened the box , i is even more surprised at the size of the camera  .
i is expecting something compact but this little camera is small  .
i own a jvc minidv camera and it is about twice the size and 4 times as heavy  .
i wanted a small camera but thought that i would have to sacrifice some functionality for size  .
well , i didn't  .
i don't think that i would want a smaller camera or it would start becoming difficult to push the correct buttons without looking around the camera first still shots    i have read some comments that this camera doesn't take quality still pictures  .
i didn't buy it for that but this camera takes really nice photographs and in 16  9 format so it is just like having a wide angle lens  .
if you email your images or make dvd slide shows , this camera can take some quality shots  .
i have email some of the pictures to family and i had to resize them all to make them a lot smaller in dimension and subsequently , the images became sharper and details stood out  .
the flash works just as well as any other still digital camera i have owned  .
more than adequate for emailing or sharing on the web  .
i will be leaving my olympus still camera behind on family outings because the hc    90 can take its place motor function    i is simply amazed at the motor and function of the motorized parts in this camera  .
this thing is fast  .
really fast  .
my jvc is a 3 year old piece of clunky crap compared to the hc    90  .
when you are playing back a movie and want to scan forward quickly , there is no waiting around for it to change gears , it does it instantly  .
the push button lcd is very responsive and the camera will take commands without clunking and whining  .
it rewinds very quickly  .
it sounds solid and it performs  .
i am most pleased with this surprise things i expected (the good)  .
the video quality    so far it has been awesome  .
as i said earlier , i own a 42 sony widescreen and to see the entire screen filled with video is a delight for me  .
the colors are rich and the details are fine enough to satisfy me  .
the camera seems to handle 16  9 perfectly  .
my wife is astonished at the quality when she first saw it  .
i used the camera in low light mainly  .
dimly lit rooms with lamps  .
the steady shot works great , giving a flowing look to video when you are walking around  .
the colors remained bright in low lit areas and in the sun , colors are rich  .
i messed around with some of the features and they all look good  .
my wife is a point and shoot person and i taught her to push the easy mode button and she is off  .
no teaching her how to use it  .
common sense is all you need dumping dv to my mac g4 powerbook    i plugged it in via firewire , imovie picked up the camera instantly and i began dumping dv as well as editing  .
that is all there is to it  .
i haven't even looked at the software that sony sent  .
imovie also recognized the 16  9 ratio and set up my project accordingly  .
quick time and the sorenson 3 codec had to be fed the aspect ratio manually  .
i have to figure out pixel sizes with a calculator  .
i plugged in the usb cable to the camera and my mac and the mac mounted the volume and imported my images flawlessly  .
i also did the same with my winxp pc  .
just plugged in the usb cable and voila  .
it showed up as a new drive in my computer build quality    awesome  .
there is no creaking (like my jvc)  .
the camera is ergonomically great for my hands and my wife also agrees  .
all of the buttons are in the right place  .
the touch panel lcd is wonderful for me  .
it is solid and i don't worry about it ripping off when opening it and when you close it , it makes a satisfying thud like it is meant to be slammed shut in a hurry  .
the top loading of the tapes is great  .
no need to lay the camera on its side or anything like that  .
i can change the tape while the camera is plugged in to fire wire and the power simultaneously  .
the camera is very light but built very , very well  .
i am totally pleased with the build quality  .
it feels like a sony  .
the zoom button is light or easy to manipulate but it can either zoom slowly or very quickly  .
it is quite sensitive and took a little getting used to  .
my old jvc felt like it is going to crumble in my hand and the mechanisms seemed so fragile but this camera feels like it can be handled with less apprehension things that could be an issue but not as of yet the pry open plastic doors for cable plug in access    to charge the battery , you have to pry open one of the plastic covers to access the inputs  .
i can understand that these covers protect the jacks from dirt , etc  .
some have said that they may easily become detached in the future  .
i beg to differ  .
my jvc has the same type of protective covers and i have not broken them off in 3 years  .
i is always prying on them because i am always plugging firewire , etc in to the ports  .
they never broke and most likely never will  .
i think the hinge is that annoying plasic that never breaks no matter how much you flex it  .
the more you use the covers , the more plyable they becaome and easier to access  .
the sony covers are good quality and i doubt these will ever be an issue  .
it is somewhat inconvienient to charge the camera because you have to open the cover first  .
the stand alone chargers are not that expensive and i purchased a spare battery so it might be worth getting the charger memory stick pro    i spent a bunch of money for a memory stick original for my sony still camera and it will not work in this dv camcorder  .
the little one that they sent in not adequate  .
looks like i will have to buy another one soon  .
i wish i did not lens cover    this camera has a shutter that opens when you turn the power on so that you do not have to fiddle with lens covers  .
i absolutely love this feature but , dirt , sand , crap can collect in that area even though the lens will be protected  .
there are threads there for lenses and filters  .
there should have been a plain glass lens there to occupy and protect that area from the elements  .
i will most likely get a cheap filter to screw in there and protect the fine threads all in all , i love this little camera and i am sure that my family will enjoy it for years to come  .
between this , my 12 mac powerbook , my 42 sony hdtv , and living in hawaii , i think i have what i need for ample amounts of fun hope this helps some out there .
i would definitely recommend this  .
great piece of work .
i purchased the unit yesterday and put it through its paces today  .
weather today is overcast and dim  .
i compared street shots (both video and stills) with my older 1/6 ccd unit  .
videos were much sharper with the hc90 and the 3 megpixel stills were of high quality and matched those of my 3 megpixel olympus  .
the automatic setting of the hc90 seems to do well both indoors and out  .
i compared an indoor video with a still , after shooting a wall menu in a bagel shop this morning  .
the color of each were great and the sharpness of the video almost equalled that of the still  .
my preference is to use the hc90 for shooting full screen stills and widescreen videos .
did a side    by    side with the hc42 , which looked washed out in comparison  .
completely happy with my purchase three weeks on .
just got the camera , plugged it into my mac and it worked fine with imovie and iphoto  .
no problems so far  .
did not bother with the sony software .
good in low light good still picture's as well cheep  .
plastic get scratches very soon  .
other ways excellent camcorder  .
dcr    hc90 stands out from crowd in reproducing excellent images and videos as one can expect from sony  .
wide angle is really cool feature  .
absloutely no motor noise , sound and image clarity puts you back in the time in the scene  .
when we replayed our road trip video , on my 32 inch tv we were virtually back on driver seat  .
on functionality if you are not too much in techie jugglery to modify the setting for every shooting than dcr    hc90 is the only camera that can satisfy  .
changing the setting using on screen button could intimidating initially , but will get familiar with small learning curve  .
infact , once i received camera , it is functional just out of the box and absloutely no manual visit required , that ofcourse gives you feeling that did you overpay for such a simple camera  .
negative side of this camera is the software supplied by sony  .
it is just a crap especially after seeing even simple video editing products out there  .
with the 3  .
0+ mega pixel video and images one expect software to make dvd's but sony supplied vcd software which is very very bad  .
image capturing tool is too generic as well  .
intervideo or ulead dvd are the software one should  .
battery life is excellent ( 90 min) with supplied fp    90  .
another negative factor is only sony memory stick pro duo media works , sandisk failed on me twice , ofcourse now even sony is in affordable price range overall dcr    hc90 is the best all round camera and once equpping with right software you never go wrong and will be the gadget to carry for pretty long time .
overall , i really like this camera       the design and build quality are excellent , and the easy button makes it simple for multiple users in the same household , some with and some without the patience to learn and use the many available features and settings  .
i is disappointed to find out after buying the camera that it is usb 1  .
0 , not 2  .
this fact is not easy to find out       it is not in the specifications on cnet , it is not in the user manual , and it is not on sony's web site  .
i finally found out about it in a review on dvspot  .
com  .
the result is that usb wo not work , for example , with adobe premier elements 2  .
0       a minor issue , since it will work with firewire , but it caused a lot of trouble and lost time figuring out what the problem was  .
the other issue is that the manual is very difficult to use       i have been unable to find anything in one spot , and it seems necessary to go to three or four different places in the manual to find out how to do any one thing , like how to use the menus  .
bottom line , i am glad i got the camera , the image quality is very good , and i enjoy using it .
i spent hours in stores playing with cameras and reading online  .
it came down to the dcr    hc90 and the panasonic gs200 (or is it 250)  .
i couldn't decide  .
eventually i gave into the hc90 because of the following reasons    .
a) bigger lcd screen with touch operation feature (really cool)  .
b) amazing sony accessories that may cost a buck or two more , but well worth it c) size and ease of use  .
there is not a camera on the market that's smaller and better i had the camera now for several months  .
shot over 11 tapes , took it all over europe the camera is so small it fits in a pocket  .
the quality produced of video is amazing compared to its size i bought this one over the panasonic (finally) because i really enjoyed the accessories  .
i bought a remote control tripod , an external surround sound mic and a sony camera bag  .
again , i think sony's done a great job of designing products that all fit together supremely well  .
the tripod plugs right into the camera  .
the extertanl mic , right on top  .
the bag , great layout , design and quality  .
design matters to me so what do i not like about it  .
well , the nightshot quality sucks  .
i rather do not shoot then using it  .
the infrared night light  .
who uses it other then the us army  .
i do not  .
and the software that came with it is extremely limited  .
do not count it as a feature at all  .
i bought an additional video software editing software which is an additional $60 i am happy with it  .
i am sure it will be just fine for the next few years when i will be bying a hd camera  .
it's a good small video camera that's packed with a lot of features  .
supports 16  9 recording format  .
it takes decent quality stills at 3mp  .
has a flash for digital stills  .
can support 5  .
1 audio with a seperate mic comes with only a 16mb mem stick which is pretty much useless  .
should have came with at least 1 128mb stick  .
auto    focus is a bit slow in low light  .
if you let go of the zoom stick in makes a click noise on your audio recording not really worth the suggested retail price  .
but if you shop around , you can find it for much less  .
if you get it at a discounted price it's an bargin .
overall i love the camera it is great  .
i paid almost $900 for it  .
a friend of mine bumped into this site through google http  //www  .

a  b0007m3plw mode  electronics search  sony+digital+video+camera pp  779 p  sony+dcr    hc90+minidv+camcorder m  ahf4sykp09wbh and got it for $779 so my only wish is that i would pay less for it too    but regardless of how much you pay this camera is worth every penny even $1000    the quality and the ease of use i have already shot more than 30 hours with it of family    great  .
never before have i seen user opinions overrate a product like this before  .
look at user profiles of reviewers , seems kind of fishey to me anyway , i like the 16  9 but it's quite annoying when waiting for it to focus  .
i have to do a lot of editing on pc to compensate  .
if there were another 16  9 camcorder i'd seriously consider it .
well it's kind of what i get for buying before cnet reviewed it but , when i saw the specs  .
versus what else is out there in the price range , i decided to take a chance  .
the software that comes with the camera is useless for downloading video from the mini dv tape to a mac  .
also , imovie would not let me import more that 2    5 seconds of video in each clip  .
approx  .
1 1/2 hours with sony level 2 tech support (terrible  .
) + 1 hour apple tech support (clueless) + 40 minutes (debating compatibility) with the guy at the camera shop    a returned ass $1000 camcorder  .
that's too much loot to beta test this for these guys  .
let sony and apple work out the compatibility kinks and wait for the price to come down meanwhile  .
it's still a good camera  .
if you can wait however long it's going to take to be able to download and edit video on your mac .
bought this after reading that canons have a bad rep with the tape loading mechanism  .
well , the automatic lens cover stopped working after two days  .
sony guy had me push the reset button and pull the battery  .
neither worked , so he wanted me to send it to connecticut for repairs  .
wish i'd bought the canon now .
