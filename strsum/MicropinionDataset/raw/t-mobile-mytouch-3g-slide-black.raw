Pros:. It has pretty much all I could wan't. 3g speeds and the ability to use the net all I want as well as android 2.1 and sooooon 2.2!!! I love that It has the touch along with the slide out keypad too! Way easy to customize and great utility. Tether!. 
Cons:. Not a super fast but still really great! really hard to think of anything I don't like about it! maybe a sharper and bigger screen but overall WOW GREAT PHONE!!. 
Summary:. I love that it has all that blackberry, apple, and win mobile don't have!!! The ability to get basically ANY APP YOU CAN THINK OF!!! Mobile tethering to 3g coverage for your internet on computer or xbox 360 live with the easytether app or pdanet which are FREE ON MARKETPLACE!! As well make your own home pages how you want them to be is awesome!!! I love also just how user friendly it is over all! I can't wait till FROYO and maybe someday I'll get the G2 or galaxy S. Really from now on I don't think I'll ever go back from Android it's by far the BEST OS OUT THERE PEOPLE!!!!! STEVE JOBS CAN CRY ALL DAY BUT IT WON'T MAKE ANDROID GO AWAY!! HA HA LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PHONE!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. My ohone's battery lasts 12 hours with heavy used, the picture quality is amazing! The Flash works so well!! Very little bugs, and best yet is the crips quality of voice in both ends.. 
Cons:. NONE SO FAR!!. 
Summary:. Bottom line is: the phone is AMAZING! I have had people with I-phones tell me how beautiful and powerful it is. Yes, it is android friendly to those who are learning, but having been exposed to the Android platform I can only say this phone is a beast! When my Samsung Behold 2 decided to turned into a microwave rather than a phone, t-mobile gave me what at the time seemed a no win situition with the exchanges being offered to me. Head down and upset, I tooked at what seemed the better choice:My Touch Slide 3 G Black.. Updated. on Sep 24, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the swype feature. The browser is pretty good coming from the htc shadow to this phone. It plays flash video . Love the keyboard i have big hands so texting is a breeze. Genius is cool too. 
Cons:. Battery dies quickly, doesn't support live wallpaper, my faves gallery is a bit slow on updating. 
Summary:. I like this phone because you don't have to be tech saavy to use it the call quality is great and the phone is responsive. It has all the same features as the high dollar phones and isn't like carrying a tv in your pocketlike some of the other phones just wish it had better camera quality like droid x or samsung vibrant does but all in all I'm sure the other issues will be fixed when 2.2 is released for it. 

$$;
Pros:. great looking, great screen, easy to use, and learn, excellent touch interface.. 
Cons:. haven't found anything I didn't really like about the phone yet.. 
Summary:. I bought this phone because I broke my blackberry last month and I haven't looked back. this phone is an amazing device, and I am pretty surprised it isn't rated higher. I was worried getting this that it would be more difficult to navigate, and learn, but HTC and T-mobile have out done themselves with this one. after only about an hr i almost had the whole phone figured out. this android system is awesome.. 

$$;
Pros:. HTC Sense Features make this phone more user friendly.. 3G Speeds were very fast.. Faves Gallery and Genius Button were very good.. 
Cons:. Video Quality could've been better.. 
Summary:. Although the screens in the HTC Evo and Droid Incredible, and iPhone 4 are better than this one, T-Mobile provides another iPhone competitor in the Smartphone market. I highly disagree with CNets review calling this a Beginner Android Phone. I used to have an iPhone, HTC Evo, Droid X, Droid Incredible, (lots of money spent), but, in my opinion, the myTouch 3G Slide is the best there is. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, bright, sharp screen, nice keyboard, good software call quality and interface. T-mobile has excellent service and great prices. Battery life is pretty decent of a smart phone, much better than my old G1.. 
Cons:. T-mobile's cellular coverage is adequate but not as good as other carriers. The shiny plastic case seems chintzy. Limited memory for applications.. 
Summary:. I got a G1 about 18 months ago because we had a T-mobile family plan and didn't want to switch. It was a decent workhorse and while I have a iPod touch and initially considered an iPhone I was glad I got a G1 because of the physical keyboard and the fact it meshes so well with Gmail and the other Google productivity tools are so much better than anything else I have ever used. On the other hand, when it came to fun stuff like music and watching movies the G1 wasn't even in the same class as my iPod Touch or a iPhone. The MyTouch slide is the best of both worlds. It has all the nice features of the G1 and Android but is fast, has excellent battery life a decent screen and has a software/hardware combination that plays music and movies was well as my IPod touch. I have only had it a few days but I love it and would highly recommend it to anyone. My only significant beef, and it is really with Android's architecture is the limited memory space available for applications.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.2 is beautiful and I can't wait for the next version.. I only paid $89 for it which is a great price from http://tmobilephones2010.com/2010/07/t-mobile-mytouch-3g-slide-official-android-2-1/. 
Cons:. Screen resolution sucks. could be faster. 
Summary:. I highly reccommend it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent keyboard with raise keys. The addition of swype is a bonus.. 
Cons:. Battery life does not take me through the day, but I do use it heavily for streaming movies, podcast, accessing the internet and navigation.. 
Summary:. Great phone and definate keeper on a two year contract. I switched from an iphone 3g and have been surprisingly happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. All of the features of this phone are great! I love the apps especially friend stream, the navigation app, tv.com, the news apps and the sports apps. The design, keyboard, call quality and speed of the phone are great too...just a whole lot of fun!. 
Cons:. Still checking it out...none so far!. 
Summary:. I really like this phone. It blows away the behold 2 and htc hd2 that I had. Everything that I use works as advertised. No sluggishness or freezing at all... well not at this point thus far. The battery life and camera are fine. I have no problems whatsoever. Anyway, this phone is worth a look if you're in the market for an really nice android phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. So many useful and free apps. Widgets are the best on this phone. Light weight, slick design, easy function. Will spend hours and days setting your screens up with the look and feel for what you need. Enjoyable.. 
Cons:. Not many. The Android Market and options make up for what is missing for anyone's needs. 
Summary:. Great phone recommend it for any who has needs of: organization,gaming, social media, business related stuff or entertainment. I have to mention that it come with Adobe and Office already installed. And soon it will have the Adobe Flash update...Something to look forward to. Android blows apple out the market....WiFi webcam, jajajajajajaja. 

$$;
Pros:. myFavs, 3.5 mm jack, Genius Button, Voice-Dialing with my Jawbone ICON. 
Cons:. Battery life could be better.... 
Summary:. I agree with all o. 

$$;
Pros:. Being an Android phone opens up endless possibilities. In my opinion, anyone who believes this phone is simply a toy or is trumped by any other phone, hasn't explored the possibilities and options it opens up for you.. 
Cons:. The only thing I could possibly consider a con would be short battery life. However I believe this would be the case with any phone of this caliber and by simply carrying a spare charged battery I never have to worry.. 
Summary:. More or less the only thing I could wish for on this phone is a longer battery life, but even that, is something I can work with. The rest of the phone... I am simply in love. Oh... one more thing the slide out QWERTY keyboard is a must in my opinion, especially with a touch phone, it just makes life easier.. 

$$;
Pros:. to much to list really,excellent htc sense,browser is super fast,fast cpu,keyboard is excellent,call quality is excellent. 
Cons:. battery is ok but not bad. 
Summary:. totally impressed with this phone &#38; past all my expectations,we are being flooded with android phones but this is it, is very fast ,no lags,no slowdowns, droid incredible needs to watch out for this phone,it might not a have a snapdragon but it is as fast and snappy as a droid incredible i know i return my droid incredible last week after playing with the my touch slide,htc sense expresso is excellent,ui is excellent,built quality is great,keyboard is great,browser is as fast as the droid incredible tmobile 3g is fast,phone performs really great,genius button and my modes is excellent feature,call quality is excellent no static no drop calls,go get one you wont be let down like the previous tmobile android phone except for the nexus one.. 

$$;
Pros:. awesome features,htc sense ui is awesome,broswer is excellent it has flashlite,multitouch very speedy,well built with greaty qwerty. 
Cons:. not much really but battery wont last a whole day. 
Summary:. this is my favorite android phone &#38; the best smartphone i have owned, excellent &#38; tons of features,htc expresso sense is just awesome,this phone is very snappy &#38; fast, it has a arm 11 cpu chip but it performs like a snapdragon chip &#38; i know cause i had a nexus one &#38; a droid incredible,but i love the genius button &#38; my modes features,well built with a great keyboard way better than the droid keyboard,the browser is real fast just like the droid incredible &#38; the multitouch performs excellent comes with flashlite,the camera is decent but not as good as the droid incredible camera,overrall very fast &#38; snappy phone with tons of great features &#38; for some reason for most applications the arm 11 chip performs as good as a snapdragon plus you can easily overclock this cpu to 800mhz to 1.2 mhz by rooting it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent features, very fast browser, excellent call quality, htc sense espresso, qwerty is great. 
Cons:. Battery is ok but not bad. 
Summary:. this is my favorite smart phone &#38; I had a nexus one &#38; a htc hd 2 and this phone perform better &#38; browser connections was faster, better call quality than these phones, htc sense espresso is awesome , my modes, genius button is great, it does have a snapdragon chip but the arm 11 chip performs just as fast. 

$$;
Pros:. fast processor, outstanding screen clarity and it does what i want. Could't think of a better way to build this phone. Super responsive and love the feel of the phone and keyboard. Waiting for the 2.2 update (Froyo) to see what could make it better.. 
Cons:. Sure battery life is ok. lasts me one day which is expected with all the apps im constantly on, car charger is a must. A bit expensive for those not on a contract. Should have built in a front web cam..its the new in thing now.. 
Summary:. Best android smartphone on the market. Love this phone. Nuff said.. 

$$;
Pros:. bright and clear large screen, snappy processor, super fast web browsing, spacious slide out keyboard, genius button works wonders, up to 7 screens, sharp pictures with a brightest flash ever experienced. Sense UI very convenient.. 
Cons:. merging of contacts from e-mails and social networks into one can be overwhelming, swype is cool but frustrating to use.. 
Summary:. The MyTouch 3g Slide is hands down one of the best android choices in terms of performance and usability. Touch screen is accurate to a tee. pinch to zoom is a very nice add. Sense UI is very convenient without hampering the straight forward android experience. the 3.4" display is vivid, bright and sharp. it's standard resolution isn't a deal breaker. viewing youtube videos and other videos are a high quality experience. web browsing shows the speed of t-mobile's 3G service for it is lightning fast. i am able to go to mobile sites in milliseconds and full sites in 15 seconds max. the taking photos are excellent. the pictures can be customized, there is zoom and the flash is very very bright. Call quality is very sharp and clear with not tinny background noise. the genius button is a nice addition which works very well, but in an environment that doesn't have a lot of noise in the background.. there is so much great about this phone that i can keep going. if there is a gripe is that the swype, though a neat addition, can be a hassle to use and feels gimmicky. other than that there aren't any minuses.. overall, this is a great phone that runs the latest android operating system with smoothness and no hiccups until 2.2 froyo shows up. many have said that this phone cannot compete with the likes of the incredible and nexus one, but it sure does prove them wrong. it ranks well with the droid incredible with the added luxury of a key pad for those who prefer. it is t-mobiles best phone and one of the best phones on the market. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice Command is fabulous- Gorgeous Display - 5 homepages- smooth, seamless, &#38; FAST with no cut-outs - Great qwerty keyboard-. 
Cons:. Very short cable on wall charger - Car charger does not come with USB cable- G button is rather hokey and unnecessary. 
Summary:. I thought I'd found my dream phone when I bought the HTC HD2, only to discover that it was horrible. But the My Touch Slide is everything I was looking for. The physical keyboard is so great to have again. I bought the My Touch 3G and have loved it, but the Slide is everything I liked about the My Touch and much, much more. I love this phone!!. Updated. on Jun 12, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome Keyboard, highly tweeked 2.1 UI, very responsive, Naunce. 
Cons:. Battery life, screen rez. 
Summary:. Had the Nexus One before this, like the Slide better. I don't notice a difference on the processors, though I do notice the Slide doesn't need a soft reset every night like my N1 did. The keyboard layout is perfect for me, and I can see it being usable but all sizes of hands. Naunce software can even understand drawls and lisps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, comfort and pocketability, speed overall despite not having a high end processor, tactile keyboard.. 
Cons:. Snap on battery cover a bit flimsy. I feel like I'm going to break it when I remove it. Other than that it's pretty flawless.. 
Summary:. This is one of those phones where if you're just going off specs and trying to compare it to the higher end Androids, and you decide not to buy it, you're sorely missing out. The photos, videos and specs of this phone simply do not do it justice until you see it up close and personal for yourself.. The first thing I noticed out of the box is it's rather compact size and pocketability. In my opinion it's the perfect size, not too thin or thick, extremely comfortable in the hand and has a very sturdy build. It felt much better to hold on to than the HTC incredible, which I couldn't really get a nice grip on (too thin for my taste). In terms of the hardware, the hard plastic with the chrome accents make it look very elegant, and the quality of the tactile keyboard is excellent, extremely comfortable to type on due it its spaced out keys.. Two things I worried about after reading some reviews were the processor speed and the screen resolution. I felt because it didn't have a 400X800 touch screen or a 1gig snapdragon processor I would have an outdated, sluggish and visually unappealing phone. Again, don't let the specs fool you. Multitasking on this phone is great, I've experienced no lag, menus glide in an out very smoothly. The screen is excellent too. I've read that it wasn't as sharp or vivid as higher end phones, but I've found the screen to be pretty sharp and vivid, even for it's lower resolution.. This is a great phone for novice users but offers a lot to more experienced smartphone users, and it's keyboard and features will leave a lasting impact in the ever growing family of Android phones.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's all that and more than I expected!!! I love my phone.. 
Cons:. Battery life which is suppose to improve. 
Summary:. It's a great phone and I love it. I'm not disappointed in my upgrade.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast. Fun. Great camera - 5 MP. Talk Quality is nice. Lightweight. Not as big as you'd imagine.. 
Cons:. The battery life is always an issue on smartphones. Also, I'm still a tad bit apprehensive about the plastic casing. Otherwise everything is peachy on this baby. 
Summary:. I had my doubts until I held it and played around with it. I've very tech savvy and this is a fun little phone - it does have a tendency to cater to a younger (twenty something crowd) being that it has the option to link into your twitter/facebook/other social networking site. But this phone is all about customization - Gotta love Android for that if nothing else- and you can really do whatever you'd like with it.. HTC sense makes the fluidity of use - well just that very fluid... no bumps or any other issues so far. The keyboard is a tab bit more consolidated versus the g1 phone's keyboard, but it's not too far off. Fits well into my hands and works like a gem. The battery life will be a problem, but it's also my fault as I can't put the phone down.. I do have a gripe - I hate that they changed the phone charger. It's not a mirco charger - I now have to go and rebuy a car charger and 2nd charger for my office. It doesn't affect how much i love this little gadget, but it would have been nice to not have to repurchase the whole lot of chargers. Back to ebay I suppose lol.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keyboard options are nice, Swype, standard and slide out. Very responsive. Reception and call quality. Internet speeds. Phone is not as bulky as one might think when looking at the specs.. 
Cons:. Not a real fan of the faves application, kind of a low res feature. Like HTC sense favorites widget better. The Genius button function is hit or miss.. 
Summary:. I have had the following phones in the last year: MT3G, BB Bold 9000 and 9700, BB 8520, Droid Eris, Motorola Droid, HTC Incredible, Iphone 3GS. Yes I have a problem. After one day of use, I think this one may be the best. Call quality and 3G signal have been very good, severely lacking on the Incredible and to a lesser extent the Eris. Did not like the Moto droid keyboard, this one seems much more usable. Despite not having a "top notch" processor, it feels very similar to the Inc in everyday use. Significantly more responsive than the Eris. Not quite as customizable as the Inc, can't use live desktops for instance, but not too big a deal. Battery life so far exceeds the Inc, don't know about the Moto Droid battery, been awhile. Heard some gripes about the slide mechanism being rough or feeling cheap, seems fine to me. Compared to the Iphone, the MT Slide to me is much preferable. T Mobile service where I live is very good, At&#38;T and especially with Iphone not good. Love the Android features and ability to customize device, and multitasking. Sorry if this turned into a review of more than the MT3G Slide, but makes sense to me to compare it to what else is available.. Updated. on Jun 6, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Genius key-faves-myModes!. 
Cons:. none!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. 5MP camera with flash takes extremely good pictures. Phone is very fast does not freeze up at all since i've been using it for the past 2 weeks. 3 diff types of input methods, 5 screens to customize widgets. Phone is phenomenal. 
Cons:. Battery Life is my only con. If you are using it non stop for about 5-6 hours your phone will die. Heard the Froyo update though will improve battery life.. 
Summary:. LOVE THIS PHONE.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.1, Sense UI, Very snappy for only a 600mhz processor, great 3g speeds, great qwerty slider!. 
Cons:. Battery, No android 2.2 yet!. 
Summary:. I am coming from a nokia Nuron and Android is by far the greatest mobile platform, this phone is amazing it is the fastest phone i have ever owned. the keyboard is great and the 3g speeds are better than that of the Evo 4g, I am currently getting over 5 Mbps which is awesome. Best phone on tmobile because the Samsung Vibrant is a terrible phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. This phone is sleek and very clean looking. Seems to be powerful enough (at least for me) running on 2.1 and has way better 3G connection than any other phone I have ever had. I switched to this from the Fender and I am so happy with it. I love it!!!. 
Cons:. The battery life is not great.. Very delicate feel. Plastic that feels like it could break with just a little fall. Case is a MUST.. Seems to have low internal memory.. Doesn't get 3G inside all buildings.. Accessories are VERY expensive.. 
Summary:. This is a great phone for the most part but like every android, there is a battery issue. I came from the Fender Mytouch which was the worst phone I have ever had. The Mytouch slide is a perfect phone for me. I love the hard keyboard and the look of this phone. It does everything I want it to do and more than I ever thought a phone could. Would I recommend this to my friends? With out a doubt, Yes.. 

$$;
Pros:. Long battery life, full keyboard, great service, loud speaker to play music. 
Cons:. not enough internal memory. 
Summary:. I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone! The ONLY problem with it is that there is not enough internal memory to store apps on and you cannot delete mundane apps that came pre-loaded on the phone in order to free up memory. I absolutely love the UI. Super easy to use! Cannot wait for android 2.2 so I can store apps to my SD card... then this phone will be the best phone ever! :). 

$$;
Pros:. l love everything about it. Light, fast, great battery, great features.. 
Cons:. I haven't found any yet. Some people complain about the camera or the favs, but I don't really use those.. 
Summary:. Finally found a phone I loved. So glad I unplugged myself from the iCult. I took a leap of faith and left the iPhone 3G behind and couldn't be happier.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, sufficient screen size, awesome keyboard, great call quality, and good looking, keeps up with most of my friends higher end android phones (evo 4, htc incredible). 
Cons:. lack of front facing camera is really only drawback for me. the slower processor hasn't been an issue for me, though I wonder how much better this phone could have been.. 
Summary:. I think this phone is highly underrated. I have been using it for about a month now, and grow to love it more and more. I am new to android, but have had blackberries, and an iphone 3g. this blows them both out of the water. highly reccomend. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. 2.1 will be replaced with2.2 soon 2. camera takes great shots not the best but still great 3. Genius Button is just awesome 4. My Favs is cool keeps everyone close 5. Battery lasts all the way through my 10 hour shift 6. and red one is sexy. 
Cons:. 1. using it as a mp3 player runs the batteries down FAST 2. camera could have been better 3. still waiting on 2.2 4. should have put more internal storage because 2.1 doesn't support apps to sd 5. sometimes the favs takes forever to reload reset. 
Summary:. love the phone just wish some of the rumors of froyo update would have been true like it should have been out one week after release i understand that updates go through multiple test phases thats why im not writing to T-Mo yelling wheres my frozen yogurt!!! the longer it takes them to bring on the froyo the better its gonna taste lol. 

$$;
Pros:. Snappy sense UI (regardless of processor being 600mhz). Internet is fast; Looks exactly like the desktop most of the time!. Andrioid 2.1 upgrading to froyo soon; Multitouch; Pinch to zoom; Solid build; Great feature set!. (Under the right conditions). 
Cons:. Plastic feel (Mainly the Battery Door); Battery (?). 
Summary:. I bought this phone out of necessity after my other phone's touch screen died.. It was a Samsung Behold (1). lol. I had a 8320 (overrated piece of trash) before that.. While being very familiar with this phone, as well as HTC's reputation for quality. I decided to Buy this phone.. After a week of using it heavily; I am happy with it.. I normally don't like to buy slider phones.. and I'll admit that I rarely use the slider on this one either.. It has zero wobble. It is fast as hell. I can use it to do everything I need to do and more.. Internet is fast. Everything is fast.. "My Fave's" takes a sec to update. No big deal patience is a virtue.. Download the "Ultimate Faves" App! It is amazing!. The only problem I have is that the battery door in the backs gives a certain "feel". reminiscent of my old BB Curve. But I'm not worried about it too much.. The phone feels solid. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything about the Slide is a winner. WIde width qwerty keyboard, on screen keyboard with SWYPE(look it up people), Dragon Dictation and it is an Android. It has so many features I can't name them all here. Flash/focus; modes of pics; panoramic.. 
Cons:. I haven't found anything I do not like about this phone. When every TMobile CSR has one after speaking about what I was looking for,I knew this was the one. It even helped my nephew decided to get an Android &#38; not an iPhone. Now THAT's marketability.. 
Summary:. If you haven't heard of it, get one. If you haven't got one, get one. If you don't know much about Android, definitely get one. If you want to start slow, buy a used G1, get used to the glory and then upgrade to the Slide.. Updated. on Jul 15, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. there's nothing on the phone i hate. i really REALLY like the camera, dispite what the professionals opinion is(what do expect of a 5mp camera?!). easy to use and screen quality is fantastic. convinent 3.5mm jack. above dececent reception.. 
Cons:. some useless apps i can't get rid of(isn't there always). the touch screen is a little of. you have to over shoot a little on the touch screen towards the edges.. 
Summary:. i wanted a great phone that wasn't the HD2. i got an AMAZING phone that wasn't the HD2. and IMHO, T-moble doesn't really have any other good phones besides the mytouch 3g, HD2, and the G1. the sliding keyboard is just what the original mytouch 3g needed and its just a hair bigger than the mythouch 3g. the genius button needs a little work, but its still really cool and nice to have. LOVE LOVE LOVE the android 2.1 in it! the swipe is really good.. i whish the touch screen worked a little better, but i'm nitpicking that. some apps i'll never use(stocks, app pack, faves, friend sreem, MP3 store and the like, peep, quick office) and can't get rid of. i mean, seriously, there's 3 music apps in it. who needs 3? but to be fair i can uderstand some ppl using these, even if there's better ones out to use instead of these.. BEST.PHONE.EVAH!. 

$$;
Pros:. talk-to-text is great!!! 2.1 android,3g internet is faster!. 
Cons:. battery life,i suggest you keep a backup battery and a car charger. i wish the speed dial holds more than 10 people.. 
Summary:. its a great phone and i love it!! much better than the motorola cliq. 

$$;
Pros:. Very fast downloads. Genius button is awesome!. 
Cons:. sliding keyboard a bit rough but no big deal. 

$$;
Pros:. Very versatile and easy to use. My wife is rarely on the cutting edge of technology, but even she finds this phone easy to use. Big touch screen and physical keyboard to back up the virtual keyboard.. 
Cons:. Does not fully sync with Outlook have to use another app to get notes and tasks. G-sensor only works in one CCW. Screen does not follow the rotation thru 360 deg. Screen doesn't rotate when keyboard isn't exposed. Micro-USB connector. Why?. 
Summary:. Overall, I love this phone. I've used PDAs for years and moved from those to a Treo 600 and from that to a Blackberry 8320. This is by far the best smart phone I've ever used. The battery life doesn't compare to my Blackberry and I'm hoping that the Froyo update improves that.. I like that I don't have to jailbreak this to use any apps I want on it. The Android Market, while it doesn't have the sheer number that the Appstore does, has apps that work and seem to be reasonably priced. Maybe there's a place for quality over quantity as I think most of the 150K apps in the Appstore could probably be called crap.. The camera is pretty good for a phone. If I need a camera and don't have my point-and-shoot available, this one actually takes good pictures. Would 8 mega-pixels or 10 mega-pixels be nice? Sure, but a phone isn't going to ever take better pictures than a dedicated camera or better video than a dedicated video camera. It just has to be good enough for the immediacy of the occasion.. My biggest gripe is that the G-sensoronly works in one direction and not universally. If you turn the phone 90 deg CCW on the home screen, nothing happens. If you've got it sitting like that and expose the keyboard, the screen rotation changes to match. Why can't the screen rotation change when I have the keyboard closed? When calibrating the G-sensor the app that does that clearly shows that the sensor knows it's being rotated in different directions. This is really a software issue that should be corrected. The charger port is on bottom, so when charging the phone in your car it will be upside down (unless you've got something to hold it upright) and the display will be upside down because it won't rotate.. Why did HTC have to go with micro-USB? Why? I have all kinds of mini-USB chargers and cables laying around and now I have to start collecting micro-USB. Was this really necessary?. I wrestled with this phone and going with a HTC HD2 on T-mobile and just couldn't bring myself to give up the physical keyboard. If that makes me old fashioned, so be it. I like being able to actually hit a key and not use a virtual keyboard. The physical keyboard is more accurate and easier to use. I occasionally use the VK (my wife never uses hers) when I don't want to slide the screen up.. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen clarity better than expected even when comparing to the other eye candy phones coming out, performance is unwaivering, excellent call clarity, Android platform shines on this unit, perfect size for my pocket, I even like the auto brightness.. 
Cons:. Battery a bit short on life at first but I have it toploaded with lots of ongoing functions at the moment...not a deal breaker, prefer a rubber coating on the exterior, Slide mechanism works fine but feels a bit light duty. 
Summary:. Performance is sterling after the first few days...The phone's biggest strength so far is its capacity to simply do everything it is set to do. I beilieve that's where all the excellent reviews come from. There are certainly the newer units hitting right now with lots of attempts at eye candy but they seem to push beyond the hardware and come up short. Android Platform shines in effectiveness and user interface on this unit. Some have said the Genius buton is lame, I think it is a really effective feature. The other new features provided by HTC Sense improve on an already effective interface well without over reaching capabilities of the phone.. The shortcuts seem to come in the housing. I would prefer a rubberized housing and a bit more rigidity on the two pieces making up the screen and the keyboard halves. Much of this can be made up with a good case or shell most likely. That said, there's no actual hit to the performance from the housing...the keyboard has a nice feel and it took me all of 1 text message to be accustomed to its 3 rows of buttons. The screen provides excellent sensitivity and reaction to commands. The pieces fit well together...it's more of a feel and sensation I'm looking for that come up short with this particular plastic chassis.. When compared to the now antiquated G1 I used extensively: All functions are improved significantly (as they should be by now), larger screen while becoming much thinner. New HTC Sense enhancements work well.. For TMobile, I compared this with a HD2 and with info available on the coming Samsung Galaxy S rumoured to drop any day in July. Unless the Galaxy can show the same stability in function, this was a great way to go. The HD2 seems to have a great eye candy appeal and you can even do a fair amount with the Windows Mobile 6.5 OS...if you're willing to work tirelessly and invest a tremendous amount of effort for an OS destined for replacement within 5 months. You can also get an unlocked Droid X or other I guess to combine the Android OS and new hardware on TMo...but this purchase for a MT Slide was for function and it hits more than perfectly. To be honest, I also did not want to become a slave to protecting and modifying some newest gadget on my hip as much as have an effective tool working on my behalf.. Android is the platform to go with in my opinion with nothing but more and more expansion in options...this phone seems to be capable to keep up with a great deal more potential as the apps continue to evolve.. If this phone holds up to use the next 1-2 years, I would consider it the "Honda" of the industry with what seems to be an excellent balance of form and function. It prioritizes smooth function and a great balance of size and features. There are fancier and glitzier pieces of hardware dropping but I am dubious of some of the performance for some of the newest feature claims. I needed a solid Smartphone with great performance first (aka it simply does what is says it will do every day), better than average function (more than enough features in the hardware with the Android platform to keep it moving forward), and one I do not have to spend "worship time" getting it to do what I needed while still being versatile enough to customize (that Android thing again). How's that for balance?. Call me a fan.... 

$$;
Pros:. Fantastic customization with great features. What's not to like here.. 
Cons:. After 5 days of use, the only real issue I have is syncing with T-Mobile (known issue) which isn't that big of a deal any way.. 
Summary:. Contrary to CNET's reviews, this phone is more than capable of competing with the so-called high end Android phones. I would definitely not call this an entry level phone. It's tons of features require time and patience to wade through but in the end will provide you with a great user experience.. 

$$;
Pros:. Slick, clean, beautiful design. Very nice screen. 2.1 Android that will be upgraded to 2.2 Froyo. The Genius button. Talk to text and other voice command controls. T-Mobile's best mobile device. Best keyboard on any Android phone.. 
Cons:. No front facing camera. MyFavs but who cares if your on an unlimited plan. Sliding mechanism sucks. Plastic feel and sliding mechanism not on the same level as the Motorola Cliq.. 
Summary:. Heres a phone that i was not going to even consider and just wait until Oct/Nov to purchase a higher end Android unit. CNET's review called it a beginners phone but after using phones such as the G1, The Cliq, Mytouch and most of all the phones offered by Android on T-Mobile, i would choose this phone over them all, even the Nexus (because it doesn't have a physical keyboard only!). 2.1 Android is phenomenal! Smooth. Much easier to use and navigate than the previous versions. Check how you contacts with their pictures scroll oppose 1.5 and 1.6 Android. Leaps ahead. Very pleased and T-Mobile should push this unit harder. Its a winner!. 

$$;
Pros:. keyboard is great.. love the design nice an sleek...fast 3g speed... great call and sound quality.... no glitching or freezing up, or needing to restart. 
Cons:. not sure about the HTC scenc look... i prefer the original android look. the genius button is hhit or miss ... when it does work... its fantastic. faves notifications over lap with android notification...annoying so i dont use it. 
Summary:. Over the last 6months i have owned the HD2, the Cliq, the htc touch pro, iphone 2g, g1 and this is by far the best. the only other in my opinion that compares is the Nexus one... if that had a keyboard it would be my favorite... but as it does the mytouch 3g slide is the winner by far... finally i am happy with a phone and will keep it for a while.. resolution is fantastic, camer with very bright flash is wonderful... and ove all my android apps.. This is definately the best phone from tmobile in a while :)). 

$$;
Pros:. Swype, QWERTY keyboard, Sturdy feel. 
Cons:. Battery life is a little weak. 
Summary:. I would have given this 5 stars if the battery life wasn't so weak. I converted from VZW for this phone after not being able to find a phone with a physical QWERTY keyboard that I liked. I went to TMobile and played with this phone and then VZW and played with the LG Ally and I found the Ally to be cheaply made (It felt that way to me). I immediately went back to TMoble and grabbed this phone.. I love it. I didn't think I cared about the Swype technology but I can't seem to stop using it! It makes text messaging a breeze. Like the video says, it takes a little bit to get used to the fact that the numbers share keys on the keyboard and it takes a bit of getting used to where all the symbols are but in general it is a great phone. The keyboard is nice - the letters are spaced well so it is easy to text by touch and the phone feels like it is well-made and durable which is something that I always look for in a phone. Accidents happen and I like to know that if my phone falls out of my pocket it won't shatter on impact. The Facebook app is a little slow to update but works quite well and other than that it has all of the standards you would expect with an Android phone. I was really excited about this phone and am really glad I didn't cave early and go with something else. I would recommend it. My boyfriend has the Droid and even though he loves it, told me last night that he was a little jealous about my phone because he really liked the feel and especially the Swype technology. The speech-to-text works very well too.. Again, the only downfall I have found so far is that the battery life is a little short so make sure you get a car charger and another one for the office or travel. Other than that I will be recommending it to people and I'm sure there will be plenty of converts from people who are sick of the iPhone and other phones without a physical keyboard or people who are sick of phones with horrible physical keyboards (the Droid and the like).. 

$$;
Pros:. Dragon dictation (talk-to-text) is extremely accurate. Android 2.1 w/ an HTC sense UI that still makes it feel like an android. Great physical keyboard. Screen is just big enough &#38; can still fit comfortably in your pocket.. 
Cons:. Battery could be better...a car-charger is a must. A 1ghz processor would've been ideal...but not a deal-breaker.. 
Summary:. Been using this phone for a couple weeks now &#38; I absolutely LOVE it! While the genius button is a bit slow, the dragon dictation (talk-to-text) that powers it is off the hook...super accurate &#38; can be used anywhere text is entered. The myModes is pretty cool in changing the theme &#38; settings for work, personal, church, etc. (Tip: location-based myMode switch drains the battery...a car-charger is highly recommended for this phone).. The tech-heads who ***** that it's lacking a 1ghz processor don't realize that the vast majority of consumers don't need it. True, it would've been nice, but I'm managing just fine without it.. While I personally don't really use it, many will find the Faves feature is a cool &#38; simple way to keep tabs on all the happenings of your closest peeps &#38; family. Faves notifications overlap with standard notifications, which is no biggie, but hopefully gets fixed in an update (at this time, the phone has yet to be released).. Most reading this already know the perks of android 2.1...but one of my favorite features is Google Navigation for (free) turn-by-turn voice navigation. Fades in &#38; out perfectly while listening to music.. Overall, this phone is amazing and I highly recommend it...just know you'll want a car charger if you plan &#38; using this phone as it is designed (phone, GPS unit, music player, social networking, etc).. 

$$;
Pros:. Performance is fast and the onscreen keyboard works well and the screen is acceptable. The integration with gmail makes it a super business tool for me. I integrated my MS Exchange accounts with my personal online accounts with ease. Love it.. 
Cons:. Battery Life. I would like to get another hour out of it. 
Summary:. I've had and tried numerous smartphones over the years and this is the best one I've used yet. I think the Sprint Evo and the Droid Incredible are a little better hardware but not enough to offset the cheaper service plans of T-Mobile. I was able to get more than double my minutes with unlimited data for slightly less than what Verizon or Sprint were offering. The range of Apps available more than meets normal business needs and the performance with multiple apps open is plenty fast. It's a little heavy and battery life is an issue. I agree with other who have said, it's a winner.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to configure. many options as for typing.. led flash. loud and clear loudspeaker. 
Cons:. BATTERY LIFE. sliding feature does no feels sturdy. 600mhz cpu. video camera quality. way too many bugs. text messages and multimedia works whenever it wants. 
Summary:. as a first time android user i was pretty amazed. now that i pretty much know my phone inside out im not that amazed no more. android 2.1 has a numberless of errors and bugs that of course prevents the phone from functioning basics like a regular cell phone would. also applications that i never open or use like amazon mp3 keeps running on the background like many others even if you kill the applications, therefore, draining cus out of your battery. this phone has too many bugs that causes basic operations like messaging and the android OS itself to force close very often. even after receiving an OTA update from tmobile addressing some problems including extending battery life, i cant see any difference in performance at all, quite the opposite, it lags more after the update. hopefully the new update will fix these problems.. 

$$;
Pros:. HTC sense, android 2.1 OS can't wait to get 2.2 update. Social networking apps. Pre installed and linked to contacts! Battery life will do. Sleek design unlike the g1 ugly design.. 
Cons:. Faves don't refresh on time, charger cord is short, genius button is horrible considering that was T-Mobile way of promoting the phone. Keyboard would have Been perfect if number rows where by them self.. 
Summary:. The bottom line is if your a social networking freak this phone is for you. A little cons here and there but I love the phone over all. I think its better then the iPhone.. 

$$;
Pros:. real keyboard!. 
Cons:. any i should be aware of?. 
Summary:. how is this phone compared to the regular mytouch? That is currently what i have &#38; it is terrible! does this phone lag? how is the real keyboard?, i HATE the touch screen keyboard. i know the camera sucks on the one i have &#38; it sounds like this one does as well. how about doing multiple things at once?. Updated. on Sep 13, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Wonderfully crisp and colorful screen, snappy performance, modified version of Sense performs admirably with My Modes, good headset volume, Swype pre-installed, excellent web browsing experience, good battery life.. 
Cons:. No live wallpapers, camera is sub-par, would really benefit from Apps2SD and access to more ROM, minor physical keyboard issues, weak speakerphone, Genius button is good but sluggish.. 
Summary:. The Mytouch 3G Slide is an interesting phone to say the least. It's basically an upgraded regular Mytouch with a physical keyboard at first glance, but the reality is this phone is much better than previous Mytouch offerings.. My first thought upon turning on the phone was the screen. I'm used to AMOLED screens thanks to my Nexus One, but I was amazed at the brightness, crispness, and overall wonderful color of the screen for the Slide. It only comes in at 3.4", but I never felt as though it was too small. The top coating on the screen gives it a slick surface that's excellent for a touch screen phone.. The other hardware aspects include the physical keyboard which I found a bit lacking. The back-lighting for it is a bit weak and I'm not a fan of the symbols placed directly next to the numbers or letters. This often confused me as to where I was typing and having difficulties finding the symbol I wanted. However, the tactile feel of the physical keyboard was very nice.. The processor on the Slide runs at 600 MHz, but you wouldn't initially believe that as the phone's performance is unbelievably snappy. I rarely seen many instances of slowdown. The most notable occasions occurred when browsing the photo gallery and installing apps from the marketplace. Other than those, most tasks loaded within seconds.. The earpiece for the Slide is very good. I didn't have any problems hearing the conversation. However, the speakerphone is abysmal. Voices and sounds come out garbled. While the ringer is load and clear, using it for phone calls is almost impossible.. Camera is another weak area for the Slide. Photos look grainy and the flash on the camera overexposes images making the subjects look like they were hit by a spotlight. Video for the Slide is decent. Two other issues in the realm of the camera were the phone's realtively small size and physical camera button. The small size often leads to accidently covering the camera lens and microphone. One has to be careful when using it. Also, the camera button is in an awkward position, right against the sliding mechanism, making it difficult, but not impossible to use.. In software, the Slide runs a modified version of Android 2.1, with 2.2 in the near future hopefully. The custom UI is a modified version of Sense that has My Modes, allowing you to customize the look and feel of the phone based on preference. I didn't use it, but it is a nice feature to have. The icons look like they are almost encased in a bubble. This didn't bother me, but some might not like the look of it. T-Mobile has also included a little area in the notifications bar that shows you your most recent applications used. Other than that, most of the usual Sense mods are here including the clock/weather widget, friend stream, and others. If you've never used an Android phone before, these widgets can be customized to show things like Facebook updates, news, contact information, and the like. There are also other widgets that can be downloaded in the widget menu such as a battery widget for determining remaining percentage. Overall, I like the look and feel of "Espresso", the name of the custom UI.. One downside is that this phone does not have access to live wallpaper in spite of the fact that it runs 2.1. All other aspects of 2.1 are there as far as I can tell. Still, the official reason was that it wasn't in the custom UI build, but they've never said that the phone can't do live wallpapers to my knowledge.. A few other software related mentions:. Swype is preinstalled and works great. If you get bored with the physical keyboard or just want to try something different, drawing words with Swype is, at times, even faster than normal typing. I enjoy it very much.. The Genius button that's advertised for this phone works quite accurately though it is sluggish to start up. You have to press and hold the button until the screen says that it is listening.. The web browser is great. On an average 3G connection (600 kbps - 800 kbps), pages loaded very fast and text was clean and easy to read. The web browser itself has elements of Sense UI in it like the bookmarks menu with its 3D card flipping effect. All in all, a good experience.. App space is a bit limited though. Hopefully, Froyo will increase the ROM size and let Apps2SD benefit the Slide because I'm already running out of space for my apps. Granted some of them are big, but the big ones even say they can go to the SD card which would save me space.. Battery life is above average. I found I could feasibly make it though 1 day to 1 day and a half which is pretty good for an Android phone. Modifying settings might may it possible for a long time between charges.. Overall, the Mytouch 3G Slide is a good buy for someone that wants to upgrade or someone new to the Android experience. This is no superphone, but its performance and ease of use make it a worthwhile purchase.. 

$$;
Pros:. I'm a MyTouch fan and after upgrading to the MyTouch Slide, all I can say about the Slide is.. Wow! The new Android 2.1 OS is faster, has more options under the phone's settings, and the 2.1 OS can handle more operations than the 1.5 OS could.. 
Cons:. The biggest let down is that all of the apps and games downloaded from the Android Market get installed into the phones internal memory (145mb) and almost never gives you the option of saving any of that data into it's HUGE 8Gb of SD memory.. 
Summary:. More PROS: It comes with 8Gb's of SD memory, which can hold a ton of information whether it be photos, videos or data. It also comes with a 5 megapixel camera and a built-in flash for moments when you need it, unlike most other phones on the market today. And with the new Android 2.1 OS, owners can take advantage of nicer apps and game features that the 1.5 OS couldn't handle. Another nice feature about the Slide is that it comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a new mini-USB port that will become the new standard in all phones in the near future. A nice touch that HTC was kind enough to provide users of this phone. So no more having to find "the right charger" anymore! Lastly, the slide-out QWERTY keyboard is a nice touch that its predessesor did not have, allowing the owner to decide whether to use the touchscreen keyboard or go with a wider and easier to use physical keyboard.. More CONS: The fact that the MyTouch Slide comes with 8Gb's of SD memory, but are not able to install apps and games onto it, the owner may quickly find themselves having to decide which apps and games make the cut, and which ones have to go. Personally, I love having lots of apps and games installed for those unexpected moments where you have time to kill and you want to have lots of choices on how you want to kill that extra time... looking up some informating on the web, downloading and listening to music, or playing a variety of games. Also, having a 5MP is nice, but not all of the photos come out looking like it came from a 5MP camera. So here is one example of why it can be great to have 8Gb's of SD memory (for taking lots of extra just-in case pictures in special situations).. In a NUTSHELL: The phone is great and well worth the price! And for all you MyTouch non-Slide owners out there, if you decide to take the plunge and upgrade, you'll be be glad you did!. 

$$;
Pros:. Very Fast processor, Phenomenal Screen, Android 2.1. 
Cons:. Battery Life, Customizing (Separate/Different) Notification Tones is a very BIG hassel, Genius Button doesn't always work, MyFaves, and the Price is way to HIGH.. 
Summary:. This is a top of the line smartphone and Android 2.1 is really the star of the phone. The screen has the same specs as the Iphone 3GS andseeing as how the Motorola Droid has a 550mhz processor and the MyTouch 3g Slide has 600mhz, the Slide wins hands down. So I really look at this phone as a cross between to of the best phones out there, the Iphone and Moto Droid, but in it's own league.. Though it's processor isn't the new "standard" of 1ghz and the screen is only 3.4" it's still plenty fast and and the screen is a beautiful display. And this is the best phone T-Mobile has to offer.. On the Con side of things however, it's battery life is substantially subpar and barely last a full day. I also notice that genius button and camera button you have to press down pretty hard for it to respond and the genius takes quite a few seconds to get up and running. I personally do not like MyFaves, though i'm also not a big social network user either so if that is your thing then you may love MyFaves.. My biggest con is that I am having an extremely hard time trying to set a different notification for each of my separate messaging accounts. With this phone you are unable to select a separate notification for you POP mail accounts and it is the same as your default account. This again is just a personal pet peve but shouldn't be a deal breaker. I have also had trouble with the set ringtones for my contacts going off, as most of the time the default ring will ring instead of the assigned ringtone for that contact.. Overall, I believe this is an excellent phone and will please most anybody's needs, however it may be better for you to wait a few months till they drop the price because this phone surely is not worth $429.99 or $179.99 (depending on what plan you have).. 

$$;
Pros:. Android 2.1 OS! real physical keyboard, great mymodes feature,easy to use, fast, extreme customization, you won't see anyone with a phone exactly like yours. 
Cons:. battery life could be better, drains very quickly if you're a heavy app user. 
Summary:. this may not be a flagship Android device like the EVO 4G but it is an excellent phone nonetheless, i recommend this to anyone who has T-Mobile. I almost missed out on getting this fine device because I almost walked out of the store with a Samsung Behold II which would have been fine but no physical keyboard. i have always preferred real keys for texting. the multitasking is superb, was able to run navigation, and music at the same time with no issues whatsoever. that may not be a big deal to some but when you just graduated from an iphone with several restrictions to Android you appreciate that. i have to say that if the phone is this good with Android 2.1, i can only imagine how good it will be since its eligible for 2.2 which is supposed to have greater features and performance.. the music player is easy to use and sounds good when you use decent headphones. the phone also has a decent camera though it is far better taking outdoor pictures. web browsing is a breeze and requires little effort to browse easily. the mymodes feature is genius since your phone can be a "business" phone at work and a totally different kind of phone at home.. the only glaring achilles heel is the battery life. it drains faster than I would like. also the buttons on the bottom front of the phone can be a little too sticky but that may be b/c the phone is new and hasn't been broken in yet.. i have always admired Android phones since several people in our firm have them from different carriers. I had to sync them to our exchange server so I got to know the phones a little bit. i had to wait til my contract was ready for renewal to get this one. my wife wants one so I guess i'll be heading to my t-mobile store for a second mytouch3g slide in red, mine is black. 

$$;
Pros:. Voice control is excelent. Navigation is nothing less than awesome. 7 homescreens WOW. 
Cons:. Battery life extremely poor..Buttons too easy to hit while handeling the phone. Cannot use LED Light with video camera, only as flash for still camera.. 
Summary:. I have been a crackberry user for years. "NO MORE" This phone has everything the other Android phones are missing.. 

$$;
Pros:. Android &#38; it's marketplace, very responsive touchscreen, very fast OS, not sluggish at all, screen is beautiful and bright, multiple texting options including the swype keyboard &#38; physical keyboard, comes with 8GB SD card, GPS, great customization. 
Cons:. Battery life sucks. apps can't be saved to the memory card, must be stored on phones internal memory. Internal memory is less than 1GB. Genius button isn't all that great or functional.. 
Summary:. I had a blackberry curve before I got this phone, and the MyTouch Slide is by far better! This phone is much faster than my bb ever was or could be, has more features and customizable options, and is much more user friendly. I love Android and would 100% recommend an Android device to anyone. I was a little apprehensive at having a touchscreen device, but I'm very happy with it. It is very easy to use and very responsive. I don't find the Genius button very useful. I've tried using it to make calls while driving, but the voice recognition is so slow to start and never understands the name I said. I head it taes time for it to get used to your voice, but I've seen no progress. It's generally less distracting to just dial the phone number while waiting at a stoplight. the voice-generated text is a lot of fun to use! Not because it's at all accurate, but because you never know what it is going to type after you've spoken to it. All in all, not a fan of the "genius" behind that yellow button.. I've had this phone for about 3 months now and up until last week I hadn't had any problems. I now have "low phone storage space" alerts on my device which prohibits me from sending/reading text messages and emails, uploading videos to facebook or youtube, downloading new applications, etc. This is how I found out that all applications, photos, messages, emails etc that are downloaded are saved to the phone's internal memory and not the 8GB SD card. I have a full internal memory and 6.5GB of free space on the SD card. Apparently there is no way to fix this until Android 2.2 is made available for this device. That is supposedly going to allow apps to be stored on the SD card. I had to delete all of my text messages and delete 5 apps just to get the functionality of my text messages back. I still can't send or receive emails and still have the "low storage" alert. I think that is a huge flaw with this device. In an instant all the functionality of my "smart phone" was taken away. I'll let you know if the 2.2 Android release fixes this problem.. 

$$;
Pros:. It just works. A must for those who needs a physical keyboard!! Swype is awesome without the keyboard (one of the most important things for me.). Just the right size for me (EVO is huge!). 
Cons:. Battery runs out fast (prob ave among competitors.). Runs out of memory quickly. Theres no way to install apps on SDcard.. No front-facing cam.. Cam quality blah. vs iPhone 4G).. (waiting for 2.2 upgrade. now it lacks foreign fonts which I need.). 
Summary:. I've had this phone for about 2 months. I was deciding between the iPhone 4G, Sprint EVO, Verizon droid, and this one. Since I'd rather have the physical KB and needed a GSM phone, I went with the Mytouch Slide.. Call-data quality is very good in NYC. Works great as a phone, websurfing/social networking device, and personal organizer. The WiFi antenna is good while traveling. Music sound is very good through a decent set of earbuds. Comes loaded with good softwares and there are many more on the Android market. Use "DoubleTwist" to sycn/import with iTunes library and other files. (I wish the sync feature is more polished to compete with iTunes/iPhone.). Smartphone features are great. Google and Facebook integrations are easy and very useful. Personally I dont find the "Fave" stuff that useful but many users seem to like it.. Keyboard has a great feel. Swype feature works wonderfully. (now I cannot live without it. The iPhone has none.) The Genius button works well transcribing my commands.. Photo-Video quality is so-so. I also really wish I could install more apps on the SD card as the phone memory fills up quickly. There are great apps out there! Would have been perfect if I could store MAPS on the SD card and could run MAP and GPS offline. (my old Nokia could do this.). Bottom line: I dont know why most reviews say it is a "mid tier" phone. Maybe the processor is not the fastest but it feels very snappy to me and all the features (actually USEFUL ones) are there. Almost 5 star rating except for the CONS above. As far as I know this is one of the best GSM quad band Android phones with a Keyboard out there at the moment.. Updated. on Aug 20, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. The overall design is great, love the slide out keyboard. Some of the features of the Android system are fantastic like Google Goggles, and the voice command feature is great. The handset feels sturdy if a bit heavy.. 
Cons:. First the battery life is terrible. This thing has to live on the charger. If you want it to last at least one day you have to turn off almost everything (bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc.). The operating system has a problem with locking up.. 
Summary:. I really hope that they fix these bugs with patches or the like. As it is, it's more trouble than it's worth. I might be going back to a "Crackberry" as at least it never had these issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. The features on this phone are fun and easy to use, also it provided an easy links between services. The multitasking was nice too.. 
Cons:. The camera is TERRIBLE....it only takes visible pictures from 2 inches away otherwise your not going to see a thing the pics are so blury. Also the battery life is so short i never got to use the phone except when it was actually on the charger.. 
Summary:. The phone was awesome but the battery life made it unpractical for anyone to have...unless you want to sit by the charger all day.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen, generally fast, full keyboard, nice interface.. 
Cons:. I don't know how cnet missed this little gem of a "feature": The MyTouch 3G Slide DOES NOT SUPPORT CONTACT GROUPS. Need to e-mail your team for a meeting? Hunt down their contacts one by one. Defeats the purpose of owning an Android phone.. 
Summary:. Useless to me, and probably a lot of other people looking to make the switch from a Blackberry or Windows Mobile device to an Android Phone. The Google logo should be taken off this device. 

$$;
Pros:. Big, bright screen.. 
Cons:. Due to the bad phone-answer UI, half the time when the phone would ring I would hang up on the caller or dismiss the alert while getting it out of my pocket. Also, it is missing some standard Android features such as Favorites in contacts.. 
Summary:. I had to switch carriers to get a usable Android phone with a physical keyboard.. 

$$;
Pros:. Moving from a blackberry to an android OS was great. 
Cons:. Dropped calls, didn't get texts, didn't get emails, didn't receive calls, couldn't make calls, randomly called people. Basically it just sucked in every fashion that a "smart" phone should be able to do.. 
Summary:. This thing is the biggest piece of technological crap I have ever bought. It dropped at least 35% of calls, I got my text messages in batches of 7-10, sometimes hours late. My emails were late. It would randomly call people. Thing is just a piece of crap.. 

$$;
Pros:. apps camera. 
Cons:. The phone constantly froze up on me and the camera rarely worked.. 
Summary:. Everytime i went to the camera the screened turned yellow and when i took the battery out of the phone it wouldnt turn on. The last straw was when I had to take the battery out 15 times before it started working! I returned it 3 times and none of them work! I do not recomend this phone to anyone who is looking for a smartphone! The best phone for tmobile and isnt the mytouch is the HTC HD2. I have that phone now and it rarely freezes up. The mytouch is not worth the money! I swear!.
