i pretty much liked everything about this hotel .
pleasant staff , breakfast better than i expected .
rooms nice and quiet and reasonably sized .
the breakfast was fresh and noticed the staff routine replaced items , even though they were not empty , with fresh items like eggs before the current one out got old .
staff was very accommodating as we bought a 12 foot paddle board and when we tried both the elevator and stairwell and found we could not get it to our room they let us stash it in the lobby behind the couches and chairs against the wall .
only one small issue was friday an large group of teenagers with adults showed up to participate in a lacrosse tournament .
the rooms and everything stayed quiet but the breakfast area became swamped and was difficult to eat due to lines .
seemed like a solution could have been to have the large group utilize the conference room then they could all be together and the rest of the gust could continue to enjoy breakfast as usual .
however i am sure there are a lot of logistic issues doing this .
also on the departure day it was raining and the lacrosse group brought up vehicles to the covered area in front of the door and left them for a long period of time such others had to drag their stuff out in the rain to load the cars .
but there is little any . . .

but there is little any one can do when you have rude guests such as that .
would not hesitate to stay here again.
