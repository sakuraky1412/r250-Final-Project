Pros:. The design,black polished body with crome finish. Blu-ray = more data(raw audio).Built in wi-fi,free gaming.HD 1080p,all games on blu-ray disc.And it's the playstation. The best got awesome.. 
Cons:. NONE:). It's the playstation 3 F.G.S.. 
Summary:. HD 1080p resolution. Blu-ray disc drive. The sony controller(the best of all time).The games that are coming in 2010-2012. It is quite simply unbeatable. Microsoft should stick to making poor operating systems and leave the gaming to the one's in the know.SONY.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice looking design, great features!. 
Cons:. easily dirty, updates take quite a while.. 
Summary:. In the top three best videogame platforms is the Sony Playstation 3. The Playstation 3 has a nice design and is quiet while running. The original playstation 3 was in certain aspects better then the newer version. The original version has less memory than the newer, but instead was compatible to play Playstation 2 games, In general the Sony Playstation 3 has excellent graphics, tons of memory space, built-in blu-ray player and best of all free wi-fi. Although not as an elaborate online setup as Xbox, PS3 dominates. There are no significant cons to Sony?s latest greatest product. In my opinion it deserves 10/10 on any grading scale.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use. works well with psp. awsone controllers. not pricey (unlike xbox 360). 
Cons:. shiney top;scratches and smudges easily. slow online (at times). 
Summary:. I i have littiler siblings that have stepped on, kicked, over played, and have just abused the thing and for the most part still works like new.. all you have to do is plug it in and you ready for all game play(dont need to buy wifi adapter or online time like 360). 

$$;
Pros:. I love it.. the Games, the System, everything about it. Best purchase I have ever made! And 3 years now, it's still going. I own every current system, and my PS3 gets the most play time!. 
Cons:. Great games available, upgradeable harddrive, ease of installation and the list goes on and on.. 
Summary:. The games are great, graphics and sound are superb you couldn't as for more! Blu Ray player as well :). 

$$;
Pros:. being an all yime gamer and played every system the ps3 has the most to offer insane online play and its free which is great insane graphics awesome gameplay and titles the ps3 is probably the best system ever made i do agree that it has few flaws.... 
Cons:. the ps3 lacks major titles like halo i love halo so much but this system does have good ttles the system lacks its abillity to be movable and i find that it does not have as long a life span though... 
Summary:. I love this game system because it completly rises over all i do not care what people say it is insane all the way to the nano chips. Updated. on Nov 1, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap price at a pawn shop! Great Condition. All the features. Four USB plugs is awesome and the SD card slot comes in handy.. 
Cons:. None, Beats all PS3s released.. 
Summary:. My local pawn shop had two things I really wanted. One was a Halo 3 edition Xbox 360 and the other was the PS3. Now you must know I already have a Xbox 360 Elite and a Arcade with the 60GB HDD (I hate the white disk trey, why not chrome?). But, that Halo 3 Xbox 360 is sweet. I got both the same day, I only bout one PS3 game and spent likr five mins on it, then went back to Halo. I really like the blu-ray and Wi-Fi. The PS3 was $230.00 and the Halo 3 Xbox 360 was $220. So I piad $450.00 for both, great deal. Now I have 3 Xbox 360s (In case one happens to die on me I can still play the best game ever a.k.a. Halo! That Sucks!). Good thing about that is you can buy a red ring 360 from a friend or a pawn shop (when the pawn shop close to me gets one they throw it away in the trash!) real cheap. As long as its not older than three years they MS will fix it for free. You do still have to send it to the repair center. I wish I could get a PS3 real cheap like that but they hardly break.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great exclusive games lineup, hardware reliability, easy to upgrade hard drive, excellent Blu-ray playback, tons of media features, nice design, plays PS1 and PS2 games (some models), nice DVD upconversion, free and robust online service.. 
Cons:. A little more expensive than the other consoles.. 
Summary:. I own both a PS3 and an Xbox 360 and I find the PS3 to be a better console all around. First of all, the PS3 is a reliable console and the value of that cannot be underestimated. I have had my 360 die on me 3 times and I am tired of worrying about it giving out on me at any time. I just want to play games and not have to worry too much about the console dying --the PS3 gives me that peace of mind.. The PS3 also has the best selection of exclusives for my taste. Games like Uncharted, MGS4, Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Resistance 2, Heavenly Sword, Flower, Warhawk and many others, are simply unrivaled in my opinion.. I also love the fact that the online service is free. PSN gives me everything I really care about and the games run smooth and lag-free. It honestly makes me a little tired of paying for Xbox LIVE when both are providing essentially the same service.. It also happens to be a top-rated Blu-ray player and BD movies look beautiful on my HDTV.. I honestly love almost everything about this console. The price is a little bit higher than the other consoles, but it is worth every penny.. 

$$;
Pros:. Backwards compatibility with ps2 and ps1 games able to access my media center.. 
Cons:. didn't bundle with dual shock 3 controllers or headset. 
Summary:. I purchased the 60 gb PS3 for the true backward compatabilty. function. I have close to 100 ps2 and ps1 games and i do. not want to have all three systems hooked up. So when my. ps2 broke i decided instead of getting a new one," Let's up. grade :)" I tell you I was not disappointed one bit in my. decision to go with the Playstation 3 the graphics were. outstanding and the sound quality was beautiful. *Bonus* i. discovered the the ps3 also plays SACD(super audio compact. disk and the currently the ps3 is the best blue ray player. on the market according to many reviews that i have read.. The online service isn't as vast or established as xbox live but it's getting there i believe, set-up was a breeze and it felt. good having a playstation 3 connected to my HDTV :) The only thing that i was. dissapointed about was that Sony did not bundle a duelshock. controller or a headset with the system. But I guess you cannot have it. all. Over all i give it an A+. Also I also own a Xbox 360 and the two honestly are preaty much the same as far as output visual/audio i'm waiting on a game on the ps3 to take full advantage of the systems abilities to utilze the vast Blue Ray disk storage to create a truly breath taking game.. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics, Cell Processor, Blu Ray, Multimedia, Online play has matured before our eyes, 7 controllers at once and their bluetooth, wifi is phenominal, doesnt overheat. it breaks alot less than the xbox 360 does. the support is better than microsoft.. 
Cons:. Online GP.accessories are much better. if you want 2 upgrade ur xbox 2 get it even with the ps3 u better get your wallet out. it plays a whole lot more kinds of media than xbox. when i burn stuff from the internet they dont play on da xbox very often. 
Summary:. PS3&gt; xbox 360 its not even close. have fun upgrading your xbox to just compete and get bent over and using ur wallet as Prep H. Overheating on the xbox 360 can melt the back of your xbox breaking it. Also the RED RING OF DEATH sux. has a 33% fail rate. Haaa Terrible. And if you compare some of the titles they both have, playing them on the ps3 is ALWAYS easier! Im not a ps3 fanboy I OWN AN XBOX 360 and ALL THE exclusives, Gears of war 2, halo 3, fable 2 and its just no comparison to ps3s. Heavenly Sword, MGS4, Little Big Planet is awesome, Killzone 2 is amazing!, and God of War 3 i mean not even close! like i said you will not have to upgrade your ps3 for along time, firmware updates can change the whole system and bring it up to date, plus the psp can connect to it and do a whole lot with the ps3. Long Live PS3!.

Pros:. I like this console and give it a perfect 10. I recommend you to go check out http://www.squidoo.com/playstation3shopping for the best price on playstation 3 console and games.. 
Cons:. I can't think of one.. 
Summary:. I recommend this console to everyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the sp3 I have been playing games since pong ,and I have to tell you 360 in no way comapres to it reliability wise. 
Cons:. image is not as good as xbox 360. 
Summary:. far better than xbox 360 for one reason reliability i have owned three of them and at differant times i have gotten the three rings of death, people complain about the cost, well break it down when you have to buy for the 360 a hard drive and internet wireless unit so thats three hundred right there so cost wise sp3 is much better value and it has a hefty price tag if you are serious about real playing i would pick the sony over the xbox anyday. 

$$;
Pros:. The best game console with exclusives!!. 
Cons:. I wont connect easily to a wireless network sometimes. you have to play with the settings.. 
Summary:. After a year of owning the ps3 I am so convinced this is the best console out there. yes it might be a little bit more expensive than the others but all that you get (like the blue ray drive)for the price its worthit. I has not given me any problem, perfect from day one. My friends love coming over to my house to play it and alwasy get amazed at the graphics it delivers.. Overall it is a great investment as game console and entertainment device..

$$;
Pros:. Outstanding media center as well as gaming console. Costs less than the XBOX360 when you factor in HDMI, HD (in the form of Blu-Ray) movie playback, built in Wi-Fi.. 
Cons:. No IR support. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing, Unstoppable. 
Cons:. 1 problem only!. 
Summary:. Amazing console. Buy this out of the PS3 series and every other series!!. 

$$;
Pros:. it has the most features including blu ray and sixaxis. 
Cons:. the lack of rumble lack of network features. 
Summary:. the ps3 is worth the money if u get the rumble controls but the problem is it only has so much exclusive but good ones though e.g. god of war 3!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mgs 4, little big planet, m.a.g its gonna be awesome, haze, gt prologue, gt 5, resistance fall of man and!!! resistance 2 rise of man,ninja gaiden sigma, 8 days, the getaway,heavenly sword, motorstorm and motorstorm 2 pacifict rift and siren blood curse just to name a few.. 

$$;
Pros:. Powerful, dependable, SILENT, great for movies. 
Cons:. None that are critical. 
Summary:. I have nothing but good things to say about my PS3. Gaming is incredible, Blu-ray movie watching is flawless, operation is silent. The pricetag might seem steep at first, but when you consider everything you are getting in one package (wireless, hard drive, Blu-ray player) it's a great deal. The Xbox 360 starts at $350, but by the time you add wireless (and the now defunct HD-DVD drive) the price can really add up! Sony is very good about keeping updates to the system posted. I was not an early adopter like many - I bought mine about a year into the PS3 lifecycle, so I was able to avoid all the growing pains. Now is definitely the time to go PS3!. 

$$;
Pros:. 1.Graphics 2. Blue Ray 3. Photo viewer 4. Video viewer 5.Internet browser 6. wi-fi built in 7.many more. 
Cons:. 1.Browser can be better. 
Summary:. This is the Best game console out their. Sure poeple say that the xbox 360 is the same as the ps3 but their not. The ps3 has more features biult in the console than the xbox 360, and the wii is entertaining with the remote but it lacks good games like the ps3.. 

$$;
Pros:. hi-def in all games, plays ps1 and ps2 games, and blue-ray and DVD's.. 
Cons:. It's a bit bigger than the other playstations.. 
Summary:. I'v played this system at my friends mny times befor and its a wicked awsome system.It doesn't have many games but the ones that are out are spectacular, like Ratchet and Clank future wepons of destruction and Resistans fall of man etc.. It even has a new online gameing network to copeat with Xbox Live, called Playstation Network.. 

$$;
Pros:. Where do I start. 
Cons:. Online is pretty dull.. 
Summary:. This thing rocks. The built in Blu-Ray drive is huge. Movies and games in 1080p wow. This thing runs quiet but be sure to keep in a well ventalated area. I have a 360 and hands down this is a way way better system. I play online using my bluetooth headset that I use with my phone. IT has built in Wi-Fi that works great. Wireless controllers that are old school and very comfortable. Im excited about Playstaion Home. Its gonna be great. The games are only going to be better and the sky is the limit. Good Job Sony!. 

$$;
Pros:. Yes, perfect. The best console ever.. 
Cons:. NONE... Just because more people have the xbox doesn't mean it's better!. 
Summary:. Sony did everything right with this release, other than taking a year to let microsoft get a big market lead. The PS3 is the ultimate gaming and home theater centerpiece.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything about it - Dam the thing is good. 
Cons:. fingerprint magnet plus price is massive. 
Summary:. Basically, this is the best next gen console IF YOU ARE A REAL GAMER. 

$$;
Pros:. Great game graphics, Blu-ray, many multimedia features, great media hub. 
Cons:. Needs more variety of games.. 
Summary:. Sony keeps adding features through firmware upfrades. This thing does it all. Besides an awesome game machine with free on-line play, it's a full blown blu-ray player, the best DVD upconverter i've seen, supports many media types like MP3, MPEG2/4, DivX, WMA, I can access the media on my PC, WiFi, Ethernet, USB, Bluetooth, Card reader, HDMI, 1080P, web browser.... Almost too many features. I would just like to see more variety in the types of games availabe. Something they can learn from Wii.. And by the way... Where's Crash in HD?????. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray and games in HD!. 
Cons:. uhhh, can't think of one. 
Summary:. I love my PS3. Blu-Ray, and HD games,AND my home media via my PC wirelessly.. This thing is a no bariner.. I LOVE MY PS3!. 

$$;
Pros:. blue ray, fast speed, good looking, lots of movies in blue ray. 
Cons:. no so many games, price. 
Summary:. This is the best console, if you are comparing between xbox and playstation make teh right decision, PS3 , is not only playing you can enjoy movies in blue ray! really cool!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Graphics, way better then the Xbox 360 and blu-ray player and Wi-Fi is included.. 
Cons:. There are no Cons.. 
Summary:. Dont buy an Xbox 360 get the PS3 instead. The PS3 can do so much more. The PS3 can even upscale DVDs into HD format. And it also has a free online service.. 

$$;
Pros:. Processing Power surpasses the 360, HDMI, Bluetooth, Blu-Ray Drive,. 
Cons:. None so far. 

$$;
Pros:. graphics, blu-ray, wifi, backward compatible, free online. 
Cons:. no hdmi cable, wireless controller. 
Summary:. I bought this system 3-4 months ago and I am very happy with it. I also have the Xbox360 but that thing is becoming unreliable do to problems, so I picked this up as a replacement. When I got this for $450, I got a free wireless controller plus 5 free blu-ray dvds. The 80GB is overkill. The graphics are great and the blu-ray plays with flying colors. It's also backward compatible (except for the 40GB) and it's got wifi. Did I mention the online is free? Now for the bad news. Unfortunately, we don't get a hdmi cable... but if you do proper searching online you can find a decent cable for less than $30. My biggest concern is the wireless controller. There is no way we can replace the batteries once it dies. I guess that's what the 10' charge cable from Ebgames is for.. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome, Is there anything better???????????!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!. 
Cons:. What do you think? No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !. 

$$;
Pros:. This thing is definitly worth its price!. 
Cons:. Everything of it is good except for the technical support.. 
Summary:. If you have a ps2 or ps1 you might think its not worth it to buy a ps3 comsuming the price is quite alot higher and you already enjoy the games from the previous playstations.. But there will be so many must have games for it. So yes this is worth it.. About the high price,by now, you can buy the playstation 3 for a lower price:. -ps3 60GB:399 euro, 320 pounds, 399 US dollar. -ps3 40GB:320 euro, 300 pounds, 320 US dollar. I think it would be best to buy the ps3 starter pack.. Look at your savings:. EXTRA includings:. -motorStorm: 65 US dollar, 64 euro, 40 pound.. -resistance FallOfMan: 69 US dollar,69 euro, 45 pound.. -extra sony gaming remote: 70 US dollar, 69 euro, 55 pound.. the price of the starter pack and the normal 60 GB difference is of about 100 US dollar, 100 euro, 75 pound.. So you get to spare up to about 100 dollar, 100 euro, 40 pound.. Which is incredible, in America you can buy it for less than in Europe.. Some of you might have bought these things for a different price but i just looked up the prices from plenty stores and then made and average.. 

$$;
Pros:. Every piece of the console. 
Cons:. Lack of Must-have games. 
Summary:. Amazing console, it offers you everything you wish... HD-Gaming and Movies, 50 Gb Blu-ray disk, Multimedia card readers and works like no other console available, Fast and without noise... When games such as Gran Turismo 5 and Grand Thef Auto IV arrive you won't be able to stop playing... PS3 is the Future now....

$$;
Pros:. Simply the best. 
Cons:. Playstation 3 Is the Best. 
Summary:. Its way better than any other console and its so good and free online gaming unlike xbox 360 and its the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Most advanced console to date. The list of superlative games is growing as game mfg's catch-up to its abilities.. 
Cons:. Remote should have come with it. Though, you can easily use the controller instead.. 
Summary:. I waited almost one full year from the date of release to purchase a PS3. I bought the 60GB model for $449 recently and am very satisfied. In comparison to other consoles, the PS3 offers more bang-for-the-buck due to the features and performance that are built-in, or easily accessed on the ever expanding website(free-website). I have no doubt that I will be playing this platform for many years to come -- long after the others have either become obsolete doorstops or just tossed into the trash. Don't pay attention to the childish fanatical followers of the aforementioned smoking relics of incompetent design and poor performance. They just drank too much kool-aid and will soon have to buy another replacement model.. 

$$;
Pros:. High graphics, wireless controllers and its got a Blue Ray Disc which give it higher graphics. 
Cons:. Not much games in stock yet. 
Summary:. Its my favourite console out of the Xbox 360, Nintento Wii, Playstation 2, Playstation 1, Gamecube, Gameboy advanced, DS lite ect. 

$$;
Pros:. Games, graphics, power, style, Bluray, Sony, legacy.. 
Cons:. Didn't come out sooner. 
Summary:. PS3 is the most powerful console gaming system you can buy. It has the best exclusive games, greatest potential for growth, and performs more reliably then any system out there.. With Bluray becoming the HD format of the system, PS3 is a must buy for this holiday season.. A+. 

$$;
Pros:. MY HIGH DEFENITION PLAYER. 
Cons:. Limited pair with WiFi or Bluetooth accessories. 
Summary:. I Have my PS3 since March and I waited a while to rate it for two reason, I wanted to wait for all the bugs and upgrades, and accessories.. The primary reason for me to get a PS3 is the Blu-ray player for Hi-Def movies, I use it as DVD player before became my home media. The remote (CECHZR1U) works great it has the control of regular remote and also the bottoms of the PS3 control, the PS3 can be turn on and off from the control (witch I will review in a minute) the GUI (graphics unit interface) are some similar to the PSP. With new update you can change the wallpaper.. The system is great, I have downloaded old games, new games, videos, demo games, thru the Sony online store, accessing the store and on line games are free and the are not hidden fees (yet that I know).. My firsts Games were GT HD witch is free (but limited for now) online and I got Resistance Fall of Man (BEST GAME EVER) graphics are excellent and sound can not be set aside, I have a 42 LCD and I had not complaints (so far). I have put music video and photographs and have space to spare. I have found places here on CNET how to upgrade you HDD on the PS3. videos and music are great but I have to mention the good quality on the way the photographs look on the LCD and since the PS3 has slots for Compact Flash and Secure Digital flash memory. The system is on line WiFi and I had upgrade it a couple of times. I have participating on the Program that Sony has with Stanford university call FOLDING@HOME, when I do not want to play I can volunteer letting Stanford University computing information to support medical research.. The browser is great when I want to check my email and do not want to get up and get my laptop or use the desktop. I can used the PIP and see TV and surf the net.. Most of my games from the PS2 work including the I-toy. The control are some kind of light compare with the PS2 and do not have the rumble (but they will soon), but it has the tilt for some games.. I used my PS3 80% of the time as DVD player, and can not be happier than that.. It gets some kind of hot but not as much as I heard, I did not notice but a friend saw the PS3 and though that it was the BOSE life style system and it does resemble the system.. 

$$;
Pros:. Too many to list. 
Cons:. PSN is limited. 
Summary:. My wife recently bought me the 60gig PS3 for my b-day, the next day I went out and bought a the 50" 1080P Plasma from Samsung. I have never experienced such clarity, it is unparalleled.. Within minutes I had my PS3 connected to my wireless router and was able to download game demos and movie trailers.. Although the system is relatively expensive (note that Sony takes a loss on every unit sold, the money is in the games) I feel it is worth every penny. It is more than a gaming system, it's more of a multimedia centre with all the features it offers.. The absence of an HDMI cable is nothing more than an minor inconvenience as I purchased a generic one for $10. I already have 4 games and a movie. Many games are due to come out in the very near future so choosing a system based on current availability of games is too near sighted. Resistance (comes with the system) is a good game, I also have PES 2008 and Godfather which is an amazing replica of GTA (best game every made).. The interface is easy to navigate through, the feather touch buttons on the system coupled with the wireless controllers are also an added bonus. You simply sit back on the couch and turn on the system using your controller and either surf the net, watch a movie, or play a game.. So far I've had no hardware issues so I can't complain on that front.. Any complaints about the PS3 are either due to a defective system or due to unrealistic expectations of what a gaming system should be capable of.. Friends that have visited and witnessed this system in action leave with their mouthes drulling. Anyone on the fence about purchasing this system should not hesitate, this is definately a wise investment as you will have it for years to come. It's the centre piece of my entertainment centre.. I'm usually not a big fan of sony, in fact when it comes to electronics I buy anything but sony since I think they're always overpriced, but this system is too good to pass up.. Hope this review helps!. 

$$;
Pros:. Sooo many features.. 
Cons:. Its expensive but its worth every peny.. 
Summary:. The ps3 is the best of the best. 

$$;
Pros:. Cell processor, HD, blu-ray player, realistic graphics, 25-50gb games, got rid of button mashing with sixaxis controller, big harddrives (60gb, 80gb, 40gb, 20gb), price that keeps lowering, etc.. 
Cons:. No rumble, size and pricey.. 
Summary:. This is, I think, the best system out so far. I think it's way better than the wii and a little better than the xbox360. it has a built in blu-ray and dvd player, and cd drive. those all together cost about 1,100 dollars alone, but the ps3 also has a built in hard disk drive, and can hold photos, videos, music, and games, which makes it computer-like. The games have realistic HD graphics, and can hold a large amount of memory, up to 50gb, while the other next-gen systems can only hold around 8.5 gb, so the ps3 games can be huge. There is also a cell processor that can make CPU's smart and skilled. the 80gb version with motorstorm only costs $500 while on realease the 20gb version with no wireless internet and no game cost the same. The ps3 can also go on the internet and play games online, but you can also IM your friends. There are so many other things that I could say, but I don't have the time. I think that this is the greatest system. It is so fun and entertaining, it should cost way more than it does..

Pros:. blu ray player built in. 
Cons:. one color. 
Summary:. good product recommend it... 

$$;
Pros:. The entire system is great!. 
Cons:. The controller does not have rumble and sometimes, if you're on Wi-Fi, you will disconnect but then re-connect all of a sudden.. 
Summary:. Overall, This is a GREAT console that really deserves our respect. Sony put alot of effort into developing this console so hardcore gamers (Like myself) can have a great console to play on. Great job Sony, you did a really great job!. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. nothing..... 
Summary:. I love it, everything about it is amazing, games, videos, the PSN store, EVERYTHING!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Upconverts regular DVDs, great games, fantastic motion sensing controller, great blu ray player. 
Cons:. no cons that I have found as of yet. The price is worth it for all that you are getting. 
Summary:. YES it does UPCONVERT DVDs!!!!. It is freaking FANTASTIC! Nothing will make better use of your 1080p TV. The Blu-ray player is top notch and the picture quality is unbelievable.. Some games are not 1080p, but the newer ones are.. Ninja Gaiden Sigma for PS3 is the best of all the previous ones and it is 100 times better than for the x-box 360.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the bluetooth connections, love the WIFI ability, every firmware deals with the problems were having or simply just making it better.. 
Cons:. Really long updates, also wish the internet browser could do more, expensive accessories. Wish they would have changed the design of the controllers.. 
Summary:. Great product, great gaming exp. I have both the 360 and playstation 3, much better gaming on ps3 and the menus are so much better on the PS3's.. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics. Blu-Ray Player. Internet enabled. WiFi. Free online service. Amazing games out, thought limited. Tons of games coming soon.. 
Cons:. Price, I guess, but the price has dropped already and will continue to drop.. 
Summary:. The Sony PlayStation 3 is the most expensive console on the market. But anyone who owns one will tell you that it is definitely worth the price. Many people are against it saying that it will fail. Although my prediction is that most of them will end up owning one. I have played all three systems (PS3, 360, Wii) and the PS3 is definitely the best of the three, by far. Great games, tons more coming. Free online. Blu-Ray player. Ability to switch to a larger hard drive, does not have to be a special PS3 hard drive. Reliable. Controller battery life is great. Amazing connectivity with the Sony PSP console. What more could you want from a game console?. 

$$;
Pros:. HD at is best! Can't wait for MGS4. 
Cons:. Sorry cant't think of any.. 
Summary:. This the best console out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything. 
Cons:. Absolutely Nothing. 
Summary:. The game library is not very big but just wait for a few months and the game library will kick the xbox 360 away!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing potential to be even better than it is already! It's a little pricey unless you follow this link YourPS34free.com/index.php?re f=4029676 where you can get a PS3 for little or no cost to you. 
Cons:. You don't have one yet. 
Summary:. The PS3 is an outstanding gaming system and the games will definitely only get better just like games for the PS2 have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Has great graphics potentional; Great picture quality; Lightweight controllers; A nice sized HDD. 
Cons:. Doesn't come with any HD cables; Playstation network is kind of slow. 
Summary:. So, I just bought my PS3 with an 80 gig HDD a couple of days ago and I can say this, I like it a lot better than my XBox 360. In matter of fact, I just sold my XBox to a Microsoft fanatic.. It is a new system so I can understand why there aren't any good games out yet, but the potential is out there and it's a great potential at that. It has a revolutionary processor in it and a great graphics card, so put those two things together, you have a powerful game machine.. One thing I found quite annoying was the fact that I'm spending 600 dollars on the machine and it doesn't even come with an HD Cable. I had to spend an additional 40 dollars on an HDMI cable just to connect it to my TV. At that pricem, and since the system probably only costs Sony 350 dollars to make, they should include that for free!. Another thing I found quite annoying is the fact that Playstation Network is kind of slow. It takes me nearly 5 hours to download a gig of information on a network that runs at 6 mbps. It really isn't the Playstation's fault, it's probably just that there are a lot of people access the network at the same time I am.. It's a great machine and right now, it's really only good for the Blue-Ray player which I believe to be the next DVD format, not HD-DVD. I would say, if you are a hard-core gamer, wait for a little while and see what games it has out in a couple of months. If you can't wait, like myself, it's well worth the money. Also, if you have an HDTV, I would highly recommend getting one of these units. It has made me really brought my HD experience to life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of potential, web browser, backwards support, rechargable controllers, blueray playback, cell processor, free online service, and more. 
Cons:. Expensive to people who dont see quality. 
Summary:. Lots of potential, web browser, backwards support, rechargeable controllers, blue ray playback, cell processor, free online service, and more. 

$$;
Pros:. Kills all other consoles. 
Cons:. Too cheap, sony's losing money. 
Summary:. I have had my ps3 for about 9 months now and absolutly nothing has gone wrong with it. There has been so many useful online updates. Now it DOES upconvert ps2 games and dvd's so everyone can stop complaining about that. In order to get a 360 to be as good as the ps3 would cost so much more money, lets add it up. $450 for 120gb 360+$180 hd-dvd+$100 wifi+$40 bluetooth+$50 gold internet. 360=$820. Now $500ps3+200gb hdd on newegg only $120. thats $620. Not to mention the Six-axis controller or the 5 extra processing cores and blu-ray which has 70% of the video market backing it up compared to hd-dvd's 15%. And the ps3 is now a media center too so the 360 doesnt even have that going for it. Also, a lot of the 360's games sell for computers and you can hook up any 360 controller to your computer and play your games there without an overpriced $820 console. The ps3 console case doesnt look too big anymore compared to the 360 with things pouring out of it from every direction.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cell Broadband Engine, Blu-ray, Upscales DVDs &#38; PS2 games, 1080p Gaming, HDMI 1.3 (Elite only has 1.2), free online play, 3 card readers, SIXAXIS, Home, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Universal Hard Drive, 4 USBs. 
Cons:. Nothing. The "lack of games" is already gone. And if you do you homework, you will find that you get a better price per value with the PS3 vs. 360.. 
Summary:. Sony knew what they were doing when they made this system. It has the biggest bang for your buck. Note that the PS3 has a &gt;1% failure rate, while the Xbox 360 has a 33% failure rate.. The fact is: people make up lies about the PS3 either because they are ignorant or jealous.. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics were awsome, the movies, photos and music were over the top, the Internet was speady and I love chatting with friends, plus the games were awsome.. 
Cons:. there were none.. 
Summary:. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Many great games coming out soon, and its a fantastic blu-ray player. 
Cons:. Some would say the price, but I feel $500 is very reasonable for the features and quality of the hardware.. 

$$;
Pros:. olmost everything. 
Cons:. the gloss finish gets oretty smudged. 
Summary:. this is the greatest gaming system to hit the modern market no other system can match it not the 360 or the wii.. 

$$;
Pros:. Rock Solid, Impressive Features, Easy to use. 
Cons:. Where are the games?. 
Summary:. Honestly, as a pieces of tech, I couldn't be much happier with my PS3. It is remarkably well made, I leave mine on 24 hours a day with no problem, and looks/feels as if it's worth 3-4 times it's cost.. Blu-Ray movies are incredible on my 1080p LCD, DVDs pale in comparison. The wireless controllers are just freaking cool, even if it wasn't the first system to have them. Media support from my PC works flawlessly, so I can now hide my PC in my work room and still have access to all of my media thanks to the built in wireless connection. I honestly have 0 issues with the system itself, it's remarkable and worth every penny... but the lack of quality games is frustrating, even if it's only a temporary problem.. Once the library of games is beefed up there'll be no reason for anyone with an HDTV not to have a PlayStation 3.. 

$$;
Pros:. Everythigns is great about this. no comparision with any other...Please do nto compare either..... 
Cons:. JUST NONE!!!! honestly :-). 
Summary:. I had this problem as everyone had while chosing which one- the 360 or the PS3 or the Wii. hats of to Wii on the other hand who are doing pretty well and not only that it is a major challenge to PS3 on atleast one stage - the game.. Well, no wonder if ps3 really fails on its gaming. actually NO!. it doesn't. the gaming capabilities are far more supeiror to xbox or the Wii. just plug in the projector and enjoy the breathtaking games (resistance or Tennis)....huge screen of about 20' is like just being there.. Ps3 doesn;t stop here with justgames....enjoy the Bluray movies on the big screen, and I bet the theaters fall back. its awsome clarity just takes you high into the sky. too good.. the networking is terrific. the Updates happen all by itself. watching pictues, slideshows, hearing to music, the list goes on on and on..

Pros:. Anything and Everything. 
Cons:. none what so ever. 
Summary:. Best system ever made.

Pros:. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Blu-Ray, SATA Hard Drive. 
Cons:. Limited gaming choices. 
Summary:. I love the PS3. I was an Xbox fan, now I've switched. This is the best, most stable, platform out there. Go buy it now!.

Pros:. blueray, sixaxis, controler, media, card, reader cell. 
Cons:. Game drought. 
Summary:. The ps3 is a great system it has so many features that no other systems have THIS SYSTEM IS TRUELY NEXTGEN awsome exclusives on the way.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great Blu-Ray Player, Powerful Machine, Capable of playing various media. 
Cons:. Limited Amount Of New Games (currently). 
Summary:. I purchased my PS3 in January 2007 to use primarily as a Blu-Ray player. It was the cheapest at the time, and with the benefits of a gaming machine made it the best value for the money. I am so happy I made that decision. With Firmware upgrades since I bought this, I definately say this is practically the best machine out there for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray, 60 gig hard drive, great graphics. 
Cons:. the web browser runs a little slow. 
Summary:. The playstation 3 is a revolutionary console which is far superior to any other console on the market today. Many people say its rediculously expensive however it is accually a better value than the xbox 360. the xbox is $400. If you want to add the clunky HD DVD player which is not as good as blu-ray you must pay an extra $200, and if you want xbox live you have to pay another $50 a year, and if you want to use the internet wirlessly you ned to buy a special reciever for $20 which only has a 30 ft. range. So were up to $670 with only 1 year of xbox live and a 20 gig hard drive. The play station 3 which is $600 contains a 60 gig hard drive, wi-fi, a blu ray player, free unlimited acess to the playstation network, and better graphics. The playstation 3 is the hands down best console you can buy. If you dont want to spend the money, buy a wii but I recoment going for it. The grpahics are amazing. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome game play, sleek design, wireless controller, blu-ray player. 
Cons:. as of now not as many games. 
Summary:. The playstation 3 is an awesome system. It not only has better graphics but also it has a blu-ray player. The blu- ray disks, which are used for all of the games hold 6x as much memory as the xbox's disks.. The games are amazing and eventually it will have more exclusive titles than the 360.. In the big picture it is a way better deal. The xbox costs $400 for the preimium and $480 for the elite. The hd dvd player costs $200 and if you want rechargable wireless controllers you have to buy a rechargable battery pack and recharger for $20 and $11 for each additional one.. Back on the subject of blu-ray and hd dvd players the blu-ray will win. Blockbuster announced that they will rent movies to blu-ray instead of hd dvd. Five of the eight major studios only use blu-ray. Two use both. One (universial) only uses hd dvd. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics,Wifi,HDMI Port Blu-ray player a dual disk blu-ray can hold 50gb, Krome and Black Shine, As well as the sixaxis has motion sensors, Many games are coming out be exculisives for the ps3. 
Cons:. NONE THIS IS THE PERFect console whic is why it is 600 dollars. 
Summary:. I would highly recommend this console it has a 60gb hard drive awesome updates Blu-Ray the future hd player. Beating Hd-DVD right know so it is already the best player. Looks nice and is a media hub.. 

$$;
Pros:. impressive specs. 
Cons:. not large enough hard drive. 
Summary:. I bought this console within the first 10 minutes of when it was realesed in Great Britain. I bought it as a future investment, to be satisfied with the massive games that are to be had. Obvisously, Grand Theft Auto 4 being my main target currently, as we all know how amazingly Rockstar north exploied the PS2 potential by bringing my personal favorite game series ever. A game that will roughly show some of the Playstation 3 capabilitys well. So cap that, basically the PS3 will be firmly dominanet in the games market. There are some people that come up with this same coment, "...�425, it not worth that amount..." Another massive plus, is the consoles multimedia functions. The fact that you can use your USB disk-MP3 player, and so on, makes it increably user friendly and easy, yet technical at the same time,- its fantastic. MUSIC, PHOTOS, PICTURES, MUSIC VIDEOS, VIDEOS, DVDS, pay for or FREE MUSIC DOWNLOADS, DEMO DOWNLOADS, FILM DOWNLOADS (at varieying qualities, from DVD to Blu-Ray High definition qualitie), MP4, MP3, WMA, DVD(+R)(-RW)etc.., BLU-RAY PLAYER, CD COPIER/PLAYER, and so on. The multimedia functions are ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC!!! And because of this, I have now basically wasted �800 on a brand new laptop, which has now been rendered obsileate. Also, it has a full internet browser, where you can stick both a mouse and keyboard straight in, with no problem. So for those mindless twits that say �425 is to much, that is total RUBBISH, seriously!!. If the price tag is your only real dislike, just wait a bit longer and buy it when it comes down in price, easy!. If you dislike it other than that, it is plainly because you would be an owner Xbox 360 which falls short, and is just another Bill Gates money spinner, or the wii (or Urine) is a childrens game station with basic graphics, and only competes with the PS2 unfornatlly, rather than dedicated console heritige that is Playstation. Currently, games for the Playstation are a little sparse, but game developers are now woring with the new Blu-Ray disk so games are greatly improved upon, and take a little longer, but hell, they are worth the wait..

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray, Upconverting, HD Games!. 
Cons:. $600 is a lot for a game machine, but the BRD makes up for it.. 
Summary:. I bought my machine in November and have been pleased ever since. With the firmware upgrades there is now 1080p upconverting. And the latest news is that the mad scientists at Sony think they can improve it up to 40% more. We use the Blu-Ray all the time and occasionally play games. The video quality is fantastic and the audio is crystal clear through my home theater system.. 

$$;
Pros:. does what it is suppose to do.. 
Cons:. lack of software titles. But soon to change i heard.. 
Summary:. This is Sonys black pandoras box to the world of home entertainment. Now all they have to do is back it up with compelling and ease of use software. Never have i seen not even in PC,where a piece of hardware when updated can do so much things and more. Maybe thats how hardware should be made these days have us even pay for software updates instead to open more functionality. But the PS is an incredible system for what it does and more.. 

$$;
Pros:. Raw computing power; Upscaling on my regular DVDs looks fantastic; Blu-Rays are the next-gen medium of choice; Encountered Zero problems with on-line play.. 
Cons:. Price Price Price. This machine will lose the console wars unless reduced in PRICE!. 
Summary:. I rated this a 10 because I don't see any drawback to this device. I have read nothing to suspect that it will malfunction due to the types of issues that plague the X-Box, and I am confident that I will get years of continually improved gaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture full of options and now can be used for a upconverting dvd player. 
Cons:. price but not really if you look at what it does. 
Summary:. I think its the most techno devise on the market.I use it for all my needs.Great performance and with its new updates its the machine to beat.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-ray player, beautiful picture, great gameplay/BT controller. 
Cons:. Not enough supprt game wise. 
Summary:. The PS3 is the best console out their. First, I want to put this money thing out there. IT'S NOT TO MUCH, if you compare the PS3 to the 360 you'll see that you need to spend at least 500 dollars to get the 360 up and running, no HDDVD player is included. With the PS3 you get a bluray player (currently valued at $999). Also keep in mind that bluray is the only format capable of displaying full 1080p HD resolution (HDDVD is 1080i which is basiaclly another word for 720p) Also, the gameplay for PS3 is amazing. When you have the SixAxis controller and your playing Call of Duty three, it blows 360 out of the water. (Another pricing issue, sixaxis is expensive to make). The only problem is the supprt from developers. I know that most are waiting for a way to tap into the PS3's true power (we all know that PS3 is at 20% compared to what it is capable of). My prediction is that when Resident Evil 5, GTA4, and Metal Gear Solid 3 comes out, tPS3 will be reigning as higher console (yes I know that the 360 is getting RE and GTA, but you can't play those games on anything but PS anymore). That is my review...for now. 

$$;
Pros:. Everything I wanted in a game counsel. 
Cons:. More videos games.... 
Summary:. If you don't have one you need to get one, the price is a hefty one but it is well worth it. The graphics alone no question, browse the internet, load images (slide show), chat, psp integration, Folding@Home, the future upgrades and wide range of resources (online games, etc.) that will be available make this gaming counsel a must have.. 

$$;
Pros:. Upscaling most DVDs, Blueray movies, Upgradable software, Linux server capable, gaming powerhouse.. 
Cons:. Very little games on the market. Little lag in the bluetooth remote responce.. 
Summary:. After purchasing a XBOX 360 at launch...I loved it...until the red ring of death (Insurance on XBOX 360 help pay for PS3). After getting a PS3 during lunch, I was knocked off my socks. Although, many of its flaws have been cured by patches (just like XBOX 360) this system has been remarkable. Not once has my PS3 froze on me, it does not force me to update before playing a game like the 360 does. Blueray movies are excellent in 1080p. Not many games are on the market that I personally like but when they come I will enjoy them for sure.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gaming, BluRay playback on my Bravia XBR2 is breath taking. The flash card readers are awesome for showing off pictures. Honestly, there is not a better way to view your pictures.. 
Cons:. I wish it had rumble on the controller, other than that this is one hell of a good deal.. 
Summary:. I think this system is the best system on the market. When we get Lair, and Metal Gear Solid 4 later this year, we'll have two of the best games on the market. For now, Resistance Fall of Man is as good a first person shooter as I've played. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is flawless, and the game is just fun.. I also bought this because I wanted a high def DVD player, and thought BluRay with its larger capacity and the fact that it's IN the PS3 stands the best chance of winning the format war. If it loses, I've still got a super computing game system that runs Linus, provides an open easy platform for lots of things outside of gaming, and is quiet as hell.. Do yourself a favor if you're looking at next gen gaming systems OR bluray drives, and buy a PS3. The negative hype out there from Microsoft (which they fund and pay for) is not the reality of the PS3, it's a superb system. Where else can you get a super computing system with a hidef dvd player in it where the company is LOSING $300 a unit because they packed it with so many features, processors, and advanced technology. Folks, we haven't even begun to see what this thing can do.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent Blu Ray play; also handles music, video, still photos ... and plays games. 
Cons:. None really; games are slow to come out.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for a quality, explandable blu ray player, you won't go wrong with the PS 3. It's picture quality is excellent, and it keeps getting improved with easily installed software updates. The latest includes upconversion of standard DVDs. It is also a capable media center for music, video and still photos.. And, of course, it is a top-notch game machine. Good PS3 titles have been slow to come out, but they are coming.... I bought my PS3 for blu ray (for me) and for game play for my teen aged son, and am quite satisfied for both.. 

$$;
Pros:. HDMI, NEXT GEN MEDIA FORMAT, BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY, WIFI MEDIA HOOK-UP, UP CONVERTER, PRICE YEAH I SAID IT!!! ...I CAN GO ON FOREVER. 
Cons:. THIS IS A LACK OF GAMES, NO RUMBLE. 
Summary:. SOLID SYSTEM REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY OF YOU DENY IT. Now that thats off my chest, this system is great i own a wii and A PS3 but of course some of my friends own a 360...ill never get used to that controller whats the use of a white button? Newayz this system is great. Out of the box its not even comparable to the 360 so many more features for only $100 more. Lets start with the blu-ray how is that a negative? Ok obviously sony wants to own some type of media format but can we blame them? Also I could see it as a negative only and only if there was a supperior format out there wich there isnt for all of you hd-dvd fans simply put it is an inferior technology the storage is less that half of that of blu-ray not to mention the support of movie studios which hd-dvd is really lagging behind in.. Lets see what else o right the price this system is just so overpriced... I would never pay $600 for a 3.2ghz multiple core system with 512mb ram, 256mb of video ram, blu-ray(Not to mention a stand alone unit costs about $600 alone)/dvd/ps3/ps2/mpeg/jpeg/mp3/wav player, with wifi support, hdmi hookup, bluetooth hookup, multiple memory card readers, a 60 gig hd, and a wireless controller with pre-installed rechargable batteries. That pricing is just proposterous. I hope my point is clear I know some of you will still argue facts cause it's the logical thing to do.. Now about the games.There are none. this is the biggest downfall it's a drag to have this performance machine and no games. Its like buying a ferrari in the middle of a gas strike. I JUST WANNA FEED IT!!!. Overall I think this system will be a late bloomer i mean it definatly has the feet to fill the shoes....just the shoes seem a little harder to come across...Im not saying this is awful but somteimes when a system gets this terrible support of games from the get go its nearly impossible to dig it out;Nintendo 64 and gamecube both fell victim to this. Hopefully gta 4 and metal gear solid will help.. THIS IS AN AWSOME SYSTEM LETS NOT BE IGNORANT AND LOOK AT THE FACTS. I DONT CARE IF YOU LIKE THE WII OR THE 360 BETTER THATS YOUR OPINION. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THE PS3 HAS ALOT MORE TO OFFER AT A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRICE.. 

$$;
Pros:. get a lot of devices in one (blu-ray, dvd upconversion, game console, photo viewer, internet browser, media server, superaudio cd, etc). 
Cons:. pricey, not too much games library (just about to change). 
Summary:. This device is amazing, with every upgrade it keeps getting better, last week there was a massive upgrade and now i can watch my regular DVDs in High Definitio (they look superb), i connected my P3 to my home network and i was able to play my pc audio files wirelessly into my P3, also recently bought a SACD (super audio CD)Pink Floyd�s The Dark side of the moon, just to check how it sound in multichannel sound, and i was completely amazed by the sound (hope SACD�s don�t dissapear, its a great technological advance).. 

$$;
Pros:. 1)It keeps on getting software updates that take more advantage of the software for example, the new update improves the graphics of the PS2 games and DVD's. 2) It's online does not lag on me.. 
Cons:. 1) Right now Sony hasn't done anything to bring games that are great except for a few exceptions.. 
Summary:. For those that want to say that the PS3 doesn't have great software, well PS3 has had constant updates to improve that. My PS3 so far has been improving and preforms better. So this is way overall this is the best system, especially when Sony begins releasing better games. For those thinking I'm just being bias I say that if I rated a 360 I'd give it an 8 out of 10 because it's also a great system though not the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gaming, Blu-ray player, connectivity, it now upconverts to 1080p, bluetooth, controllers. 
Cons:. lack of games. 
Summary:. I have had my PS3 since standing outside in the cold to get it, and i still love the thing. I am writing this to inform people that it now upconverts to 1080p, i tried it out on my tv and it looks amazing. Just thought people should know..

Oblivion has AMAZING graphics and loading times(better than 360s by the way) and has Knights of the Nine included.. About the controller, I prefer this one than the 360 controller. It dont uses AA batteries so I dont have to spend any more money on batteries. In my opinion (this is personal tho), I find the ps3 controller much more comfortable that the 360s. Its a lot lighter (you do notice the difference in weight after a few hours of playing), and the D-Pad is a LOT better than 360s. After hours of playin i still feel my hands relaxed with this controller. I found controllers battery life is about 9 hours (more than enough) and they charge pretty quickly.. The Design, well, you can rate for yourself. This machine is so sexy I cant stop looking at it, and its quieter than the 360. Its space black color is beautiful not like 360s Elite matte which looks like crap. In my opinion the best thing about the design is its touch sensitive power on/off and eject discs bottons, I promise the first time you turn this beast on, there will be some Oooh/Aaah. And by the way, it does not use a power brick (360s, anyone?), that explains its size.. Now the difficult part, The Software. Even tho I love this OS (same as PSP), it does has disadvantages. Keep in mind Sony has yet yo keep updating the system (right now I have Ver 1.70). Things I dont like bout the software: a) You cant play music while playing (360 can). b) Its marketplace doesnt compare with the one Xbox has. And c) Downloads and updates take forever!, and the Ps3 browser is bit sluggish.. I hope all this will be fixed in future updates.. Now for the system itself, the specs say it all. It has included wi-fi, HDMI port (which it took the xbox a year to get...), 60 GB HDD (which you can change with any laptop hard drive, thats up to 200GB, 80 more than the Elites 120GB, for an extra charge of course), Cell Processor, and most important BLU-RAY drive and discs.. So it may have some software cons, few games, poor live marketplace and poor online play (hey its free... just wait for Home), but im still giving this Beast a Perfect 10 because it is the TRUE next gaming machine and HD player..

Pros:. great design, blueray, wireless motion senserd controlers, really quiet engine and fan, excellent graphics. 
Cons:. the only con is that ps3 is pretty expensive. 
Summary:. the ps3 wont be beaten. the ps3 is future proof and beats all it competition. 360 fans r just jealous that they cant afford a ps3 so they just settle for the cheap consoles. ps3 has so many better features than the 360, the best feature being blueray. on a hd tv ps3 can run on 1080p and the 360 can only run on 1080i. sony ps3 rules all!!!.

Summary:. I purchased my Playstation 3 a couple months after it came out in North America, and let me tell you, it's a very nice machine for gaming and entertainment purposes. Although I do not watch Blue-Ray movies (I just stick to DVD), it's nice knowing that I have a Blue-Ray drive and when Blue-Ray becomes as popular as DVD, I won't have to go out and spend $1500 to purchase a Blue-Ray player. The Playstation 3 is a Blue-Ray player and it's a bargain if your going to be using it for Blue-Ray viewing. Since the system just came out, the games for the system are not the greatest...right now, but just give it some time and developers will eventually begin coming out with better games, especially since Playstation 3 games are now being made on BD-ROM, which has 50 gigabytes instead 4.7 gigabytes on DVD. The features of the Playstation 3 are also very nice. The whole Folding@Home system is very nice, and I really think it's going to help cancer research. It's also nice that it has a internet browser so those who have wireless internet can enjoy HD internet browsing. The Playstation 3 also looks very nice. I love the all black shiny look with the chrome trim. One thing that would be a problem, though, would be that the Playstation 3 likes to attract many, many fingerprints and dust. It's like I'm dusting it every five minutes. Another problem was after playing for 5+ hours, the room in which I am playing in gets VERY warm, and I think I can blame the Playstation 3 for this problem, so that's another problem. Overall, I highly recommend this system if one is seeking a system that basically has everything for a reasonable price (seeing the features it has). 

$$;
Pros:. online , service is a huge upgade from ps2, full hd, easy to set up and use. 
Cons:. Game library is small ,but the machine has just came out.. 
Summary:. Is a great machine has an awesome online which is improving each month it is out, ps store uses money not points so it is easy to figure how much is really being spent. already has great games in resistance and motorstorm, plays movies, music, photos and has a web browser to surf the web. this is a must buy for any gamer.. 

$$;
Pros:. Stunning graphics, 1080p support, Blu-ray, HDMI, WIFI, large hard drive, Bluetooth, supports 7 controllers, Internet browsing, 4 USB ports, keyboard &#38; mouse support, and so much more.. 
Cons:. Lack of RPG's (Currently). 
Summary:. Worth every penny I paid. It has so much to offer--Stunning gaming experience, amazing quality blu-ray flicks, WIFI, Internet browsing, media storage (pictures, movies, music, etc.) 60GB. This system functions as a gaming console and more--a complete home entertainment system. With that considered, I'm surprised it's not much more expensive.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray &#38; HD gaming!!. 
Cons:. Light launch games. 
Summary:. What can I say but WOW!!. I've quit buying DVD's &#38; will only buy Blu-Rays from now on, the picture quality is awsome!!. The release games are few &#38; the quality is not optimum but you can say that about every launch line up so I'm not taking points off for it.. Once the game developers learn how to use the cell processors the games will be outstanding, while it's not perfect yet I'm giving it a 10 because it won't let me give it a 9.5.. The WiFi connection makes game &#38; movie trailer downloads easy, I've actually bought several games I normally wouldn't have because i was able to play the free download versions, all the downloads I've been doing means the 60G hard drive was a necessity not a luxury.. Being able to update the PS3 on WiFi is great too, that means it will be a long time before it's obsolete.. I also use the memory card slots, I watch videos &#38; pictures I've shot on my big screen, it's much better than looking at them on a 3x5 piece of paper!!. All in all I'm very pleased with my PS3, now that rumble has been added back (there's that update again!) even the PS2 games work with rumble &#38; all the new games will have it too!. 

$$;
Pros:. Its the most powerful and best graphics providing console, this is a fact so all u people who bought and xbox can't say that ps3 sucks ur just jealose. 
Cons:. the price is the only downside but for a bluray player and free online play its great. 
Summary:. I get very anoyed when people critisice the price as it is good value for money, it is a million million miles better than xbox 360. you cannot compare it to the wii but the ps3 has motion sensors aswell so if u buy one you get brilliant free online play(unlike xbox), amazing graphics (better than xbox), a bluray player( if you buy a hddvd for xbox it will set you back another �130) its twice as powerful as the xbox with an 8 celled processor, motion sensor, it doesnt go wrong ( i know three people with an xbox 360 and two of them have had to send theres of to get repaired) and did you know that the graphics card in the PS3 is twice as powerful than anything available for a pc.. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray, WiFi, Bluetooth, SixAxis contollers. 
Cons:. No rumble... yet.. 
Summary:. This is a GREAT buy for the technology. $599 for a Blu-Ray player, alone, makes it worth it. Eventually games written, specifically, for the PS3 will be able to show off the hardware capability. Most early titles were written for other formats and released on the PS3. I am not knocking the other formats, but this system is capable of more than the game titles have shown. Gran Turismo HD should be a big release..

Pros:. Blu-Ray, Quality of Build, Free Online. 
Cons:. None other than losing exclusives. 
Summary:. After having 2 and a half 360's break, I decided to take a chance on PS3 and I haven't been disappointed yet. The quality on this machine is sensational. The free online play is a big selling point since I don't have to pay $60/year. After 4 years, you will made the price difference between 360 and PS3. The Blu Ray player I thought was necessary but after watching a couple, I will never buy another DVD. Also, the games will need the extra storage on a Blu Ray later on. So if you want to play an epic game like Metal Gear Solid, you only need the 1 Blu-Ray disk. 360 would need like 6 or more disks. The little things about PS3 make it great like 7 controllers instead of 4, motion sensing controller, HDMI, web browser, better games, bluetooth headsets instead of having to buy a 360 specified one, and probably a few other things that I am forgetting.. Overall, the quality and features of the PS3 make it an amazing value.. 

$$;
Pros:. Affordable blu-ray player, future ready for java blu-ray, amazing 1080p picture, amazing sound, internet browser, wi-fi, so much versatility. 
Cons:. no DVD upscalling yet, internet browser slow compared to the Nintendo Wii, Online community not very big but may improve with PS Home. 
Summary:. I have to say I have never been a Sony Playstation fan. I just grew up with Nintendo and loved their games Like Super Mario Bros and The Zelda franchise. When I heard what the SONY playstation 3 was about and how it supported blu-ray and high definition games I only hoped that the system would live up to the hype. After finally getting my hands on one a little bit before Christmas I have to say the SONY Playstation 3 is one amazing system and was worth the wait. As for the games there are not many that show the true potential of this amazing system just yet though many are still a blast to play. I do have to say the Motor Storm Demo in (720p) and Gran Turismo HD demo (1080p) show an amazing amount of detail and some parts look like reality especially on a True HD TV capable of 1080p. I have this connected to my SONY KDL-46XBR3 46 inch Bravia 1080p HDTV LCD TV and the playstation 3 allows me to see what a HD tv is capable of when given great content. Most of the Blu-ray movies look amazing (Crank, Invincible, The Devil Wears Prada, Black Hawk Down) but some movies on blu-ray look just above DVD quality like The Covenant and Silent Hill. I guess that depends on the quality of the transfer of the film. The motion sensor bluetooth controls are great. I am really glad Sony released their new Bluetooth Play station 3 Blue-Ray DVD Remote (item #B000M17AVO here on Amazon) because it makes navigating the blue-ray movies so much easier than the regular controls. I like the fact that the system has online connectivity and that it also has a built in browser should you just want to surf the internet. Most of all I like the fact that the 60 gig model gives a built in Wi-fi connection so if you all ready have internet access you just have to buy a wi-fi router (I use the Linksys WRT54GS Wireless-G Broadband Router item #WRT54GS here on Amazon) and pop in the CD that comes with the router. Follow the simple instructions and bam you have your ps3 on line wi-fi and free from all those extra wires. You can even download your favorite music/videos to the ps3 hard drive and if available online it will display the artist names and songs. You can even connect a USB keyboard (along with almost any type of USB device) to make surfing the internet faster and more enjoyable. I have to say I am very happy with giving the Playstation 3 a chance and I highly recommend it for anyone who appreciates a great game system with some awesome entertainment features.. 

$$;
Pros:. The CPU power, the noice. 
Cons:. limited games. 
Summary:. It has a very powerful CELL processor, really good at folding@home, i have been folding 24/7. The console never shuts down, the noise is low compare to my xbox360. online play needs to be improved.. 

$$;
Pros:. Graphics, built in Blu Ray, HDMI 1.3, true PCM audio, very expandable: wifi bluetooth, 4x USB 2.0 and slots for CF, MS and SD. 
Cons:. no simultaneous audio out (more on that below), remote controller battery life, poor package contents (2 ft usb cable, no hdmi cable , cheap av cable included). 
Summary:. Just play a game on this thing with a 1080p LCD. I was a Xbox 360 fan boy until I realized that the Xbox is utter **** after using this thing for a few weeks.. I got it as a birthday present, boy was I happy. I bought some cheap HDMI cables off amazon (2 for $12) and hooked up my PS3 to my Samsung 40" 1080p HDTV. I bought Resistance: Fall of Man and downloaded a bunch of demos to see what was new or to be released. I am very impressed by this system. About a month after owning it I put my Xbox 360 on eBay.. Now for the cons. I have to say I am pretty pissed off that there isn't simultaneous audio out. Even the PS2 had this. Basically, lets say some days you don't want the sound to come out of the Home Theater Receiver, you want it out of the T.V., then you have to re-configure the audio out settings every time you do this. Doesn't matter how you've got the cables hooked up. Very stupid.. Then I heard about the new standard coming along: HDMI 1.3. If you guys haven't read about this one, google it. Its the only way to get 7.1 channel uncompressed sound, supports extremely high visual bandwidths. I thought holy **** my PS3 is obsolete. Haha nope, the PS3 was the first device to have HDMI 1.3 technology built right into it. People don't understand how future proofed Sony made this thing. The Xbox 360 has to come out with an Elite, even then it does not sport an HDMI 1.3 so they will have some sort of "Xbox Ultra" **** coming out 12 months after that, etc etc.. And for the people who think HDMI 1.3 won't matter, think of things this way: Look how ****** the graphics of the Playstation 2 were when they first came out. Then a few years later they started looking really good. Now look at the PS3 graphics right now. They are superb. Imagine how sick the games will look in about a year from now. They'll finally output 1080p games with full uncompressed 7.1 audio, and to actually have your T.V. and home theater system capable to reproduce this **** you need the bandwidth in HDMI 1.3. HDMI 2.2 and lower, as well as optical and coaxial digital cables lack the bandwidth needed for this.. Oh yeah and Blu Ray player, wow. You need to see the difference between Blu Ray and regular DVD to appreciate it. The people with 720p T.V.s and below will cry and ***** about this and run to their Xbox's beuse it matches their ****** T.V.s.. The remote controllers battery life could of been better. Come on Sony, a 2ft USB cable and a cheap ass AV cable? Whos gonna hook up a $600 PS3 with a composite video cable? Thats like buying an HDTV cable box and hooking it up with a, well, composite video cable. Anyone who does that should be cracked over the head. Buy a friggin Wii if thats the graphics you want.. BTW the Wii is pretty cool.. If anyone is interested in buying used Xbox 360 games send me a PM..

Pros:. blu ray, hi def 1080p, realistic graphics, cell processor, rsx processor, online capabilities, sixaxis, changable HDD, etc. 
Cons:. controllers lack rumble. 
Summary:. I find that the ps3 is the best over all gaming system. It has blu ray, with a maximum of 50 GB of disc space, high def gaming in 1080p at 60 fps, the cell processor is amazing, which can perform at 2 TFLOPS, or two trillion calculations per second, the controller is very accurate and is easy to maneuver with the wireless blue tooth incorporated, the rsx is pretty awesome, and colorization, textures, and over all graphics are superior to other consoles (or will be in the future when better game engines are used, specifically in the near future the unreal engine and of course the white engine. A regular dvd, which other consoles use can only hold 5 GB, (even the 360, as the hd dvd add on is only for movies, not for games) and blu ray can hold 50 gigabytes, meaning more intricate and graphically superior games. gears of war was good graphically, but in reality ps3 can and will do that and better,(gears of war pretty much filled up a standard disc, and rfom used about 15 GB) they are using the same engine in soon to be released titles as GOW. Gears of war, though great was really short, as opposed to resistance which has many more levels and more multi player content, though it's not graphically superior due to use of a ps2 engine, (resulting in lower quality textures) instead of newer games with more sophisticated engines.. in the future, as in a few months, more and more games will use more sophisticated game engines and make better games. as of lack of games, open your eyes, ps3 is coming out with tons of new games in the near future, here's a list of ps3 exclusives, being made or have been made for only the ps3 -http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS3_exclusives. 

$$;
Pros:. can use the older games, don't have to buy all new ones. 
Cons:. couldn't really find any. 
Summary:. When we were looking into buying a new system, we just couldn't decide we looked through games, reviews, price, and played our friends, Wii's, &#38; 360's. But when it came right down to it we realized that we already have many games for the PS1 and PS2, and could still continue to play them with the PS3. So we broke down and bought the thing, I have to tell you I almost had a heartattack actually ploping down the money. Once we got it home we set it up and started really seeing what we could do with it. That was last night, and this morning we found many more things we could do. We have attached our MP3 players and listened, attached our camera and had a small slide show, hooked it up to our wireless conection and surfed the internet (including watching music videos from youtube) We checked out the sony store, downloaded some movie trailers, game trailers and demos, and right now my husband is playing "Resistance" online for free. I'm sure that in the 12 hours we've had this thing we've only begun to scratch the surface of what it can really do, and I have to tell you, I don't feel like I wasted my money anymore. In fact I feel like I probably got a deal, considering bluetooth players alone are much more expensive and that's just part of what it can do. If you're even considering buying this, it is deffinatley the way to go.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluray, HDMI, 1080p, final fantasy, mgs4, web browser, burn your music and videos to the hdd. Download tekken 5 and such from the PS store in the background and do something like help cure cancer!. 
Cons:. It gets fingerprints too easy. I don't count no hdmi as one because I use hdmi to dvi anyways so hdmi would be useless to me. No in game soundtracks. 
Summary:. All you guys giving it a low review need to get a PS3 before you review it. I own xbox 360 and PS3 and IMO it's no competition. Playstation 3 feels like a $750CDN piece of equipment. It's a multimedia hub and play a game like resistance, and you'll question why you pay $8 for xbox live. Pop in a game like ridge racer 7 and you'll no doubt never question PS3s 1080p graphics again. Pop in a game like motorstorm and experience physics at a whole new level. If you are here rating it a 2 or 3, you don't own a PS3. Sorry, but no one I know rated it under a 7 and 7 only because of the limited games, no in game soundtracks(will be added), and bad friends list configuration(will be fixed). Also, I know about 10 people who own both consoles and they all see more potential and promise in PS3. Heck, we all get together and play Motorstorm online or fold the proteins to help cancer together! Even Ea games say that 360 is reaching it's last gen graphics in 2007 with games like Halo, but the CELL processor in PS3 has so much to explore. The cell processor will also be featured in Cell phones in late 2007, and HOME will be cross platform with PSP and Sony cell phones. What's also cool is that soon I'll be able to be in Europe with my PSP and stream all the videos, music, send my friends messages on my ps3 in canada!.

Pros:. games features. 
Cons:. no cons are here. 
Summary:. its my best console and it is the best of the 3. 

$$;
Pros:. So many to list in this little space. 
Cons:. I haven't come across 1 yet.. 
Summary:. I just wanted to say that the PS3 is the best system on the market. This is not just an opinion anymore, it is absolute fact. Some people have a problem with the price, saying that the 360 is cheaper thus making it the better buy. It's cheaper because it has so much less. The biggest being that the PS3 comes equipt with a Blu-ray disc drive that plays HD movies, the 360 does not. If you want an HD DVD player to watch movies for your 360, you have to go out and spend $200 making it identical in price to the PS3. Even then, the PS3 would have so much more than the 360. 60 GB HD, cell processor, it runs so much quieter and cooler, plus it has a slot for just about every media card out there. As far as games go, within a year developers will have a better understanding of how much they can put into a game using the cell-processor and the blu-ray format. They'll have better ideas using the six-axis controller in gameplay and much, much more. The amount of potential that the PS3 has far outweighs that of the Xbox 360. Not only is it a more powerful machine but it's also so much better looking. I just finished setting up my online connection wirelessly and I'm connected to my 42" Panasonic Plasma TV via HDMI cable because my game system came equipt with a HDMI slot. I wish I had a bigger TV with 1080p so that I could take full advantage of this system as far as resolution goes. I'm not saying that the xbox 360 is straight poop, I'm just saying that the PS3 is the better system, that's all. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the mthafkn' truth.. 

$$;
Pros:. YOU CAN PLAY YOUR PS1 AND PS2 GAMES.. 
Cons:. I SEE NO CONS.. 
Summary:. I'm so glad I purchased this system. This a a great game console and a blue ray dvd player. A game console that can play games from ps1, ps2 and for only $600. Does the xbox 360 come with a blue ray dvd player? NO! Can the xbox 360 play all of the xbox games right out of the box without downloading updates? NO! Does the playstation 3 overheat like the xbox 360? NO! Can you upgrade the xbox 360 hard drive like you can upgrade the playstation 3 hard drive? NO! I don't have HD or an HDTV and the graphics still look great on my 36 inch Philips Maganzox tv. Do the xbox 360 graphics look good in standard def? NO! Does the xbox 360 right quietly like like ps3? NO! What over questions do you need answered. Most of the negative comments come from haters who can't afford to buy one. And no I'm not a fan boy I'm just a gamer who started with the atari 2600 and has been gaming ever since.. 

$$;
Pros:. The major factors for buying the PS3 over the XBOX 360 were the internet features are free, Bluray player, PSP interface, and backwards play with PS2 games.. 
Cons:. Of course it is the price but for what you pay for I believe it is worth every penny.. 
Summary:. Great system!!! Going online to the Playstation store to play the demo's before buying is a tool to save your money. Also buying games online is cheaper than buying at the store. Downloading is kind of slow but other than that I am satisfied..

Cons:. Controller loses connectivity sometimes for a few seconds, motion sensing isn't as accurate as the Wii, PlayStation Online doesn't offer many features but will improve, no USB ports on the back.. 
Summary:. Overall the a great video game console. it doesn't have a lot of good games, but it will get some in the future along with better online play and all games are on Blu-ray discs. Motion sensing is used good in games and looks really nice anywhere in a house. It has more good features than I could've listed and has internet connectivity out the box along with Bluetooth, so it can use any Bluetooth headset, keyboard, or mouse out there and with a massive 60 GB hard drive that can also be replaced with almost any 2.5 inch laptop hard drive.. Overall $600 is good for a video gaming console that is basically a home computer that can play next generation games and can play Blu-ray movies. The reason I gave this console a perfect 10 rating is that since the system has firmware technology along with all other next generation consoles, the PlayStation 3 will become even better than what it is now..

The Blu-ray drive is great for gamers who like longer games and movie lovers who want high-def. the light weight blurtooth controllers are easy to use and offer sixasis (motion sensing) for dramatic game play and extended battery life. The 60Gb hard drive gives gamers space to load a new OS, Download Demos and movies, and save games and songs.

Summary:. A very powerful machine. About the cheapest BD player available. Only 1080p gaming console. I could go on and on, but the 360 fans would still complain and PS3 fans already know how good it is.. True $600 is expensive, but if you buy a top of the line gaming PC (which is what this is) you could easily spend $2,000+. Add a BD player and you're at another $800+. The fact that it is a BD player is enough to win me over. If you don't care about BD you will soon and every TV is going to be HD in the coming years. Every PS3 owner is ahead of the game.. Think what you will, but I doubt any PS3 owner is disatisfied with their product. I just can't wait until the game developers really tap into the full potential of it's processing power and for Blockbuster to rent BD's at every location. Sorr HD-DVD..

Summary:. It never fails to amuse me (in a smug way) how the 360 gang attempt to put the PS3 down. Complaints that it's too pricey are the best ones! Okay, it's not cheap, but the features bought as separate items would amount to a massive amount more. XBox 360 owners should try to build their own PS3 - start buy paying extra for the HD-DVD add-on, then buy the Wi-Fi feature, a memory unit, subscription to Xbox Live and the monthly charge = SHOCK, more than a PS3, which includes all this FOR FREE - it's basic maths guys. All this and 40GB extra hard drive to play with. You also don't need to blow your speakers in an attempt to hear the games/movies, like you would with the 360, due to the noisey fan. 360 owners are understandabley upset that they have spent all that money too soon and now need to spend again to be at the cutting edge. The only alternative for them is denial. The Xbox was replaced by the 360 in just 3 years, the PS2 has lived for 7. It seems to me that Microsoft fanboys will be spending more money to upgrade before those opting for PS3. The best advice, in my humble opinion, is play a PS3 - to play one is to want one, it's that good.. 

$$;
Pros:. all I just love it. 
Cons:. heavy : ) Thats all for the moments. 
Summary:. I just bought the PS3 and it is amazing!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. BlueRay DVD is awesome. 
Cons:. Not very many games. 
Summary:. I bought the PS3 and a Samsung 56" DLT rear projection TV with the 1080p. The PS3 playing a BlueRay like Syriana was just amazing. I could actually see the contrast with the makeup between the face and neck on Matt Damon.. I have played pretty much all the game on the PS3 that are out. Resistance and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance are both really awesome games. If the games catch up with the system I will be extremely happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use OS, well designed controller, fast load/save, no overheating (so far). 
Cons:. bit expensive. 
Summary:. i got my ps3 a few days ago for my birthday and its awesome. just the overall look is appealing to everyone even my best friend who has an xbox360 said Sony wins in that department. The menu/OS on the ps3 is easy to use and well made. Setup takes only a few minutes. The games work very well and have very little to no save and load times. Controllers are like the PS2 controllers but i like how the L2 and R2 are now like the Trigger buttons(xbox 360) but better. Charging the controllers can be done even when the system is off. The only downside is that a secondary controller doesnt come with its own cable, but any USB to external device (digital camera, etc.) will work. Overall i think this system is definatly a 10/10 and that in the future the games will be better than they are now. 

$$;
Pros:. all worth it. 
Cons:. its has all black and a siaxi. 

$$;
Pros:. The PS3 is a Xbox360 and Wii rolled in one.. 
Cons:. Only a few available games to date. 
Summary:. 

$$;
Pros:. Blu-Ray which can store up to 54 GB. 60 GB harddrive. Six USB ports. Great Games. Nice design. SIXAXIS controller with motion sensing.. 
Cons:. No rumble-feedback. It is a fingerprint magnet. Expensive.. 
Summary:. It is the greatest console ever with the best graphics and processing power. This is a machine you will be using for a very long time.Plus, it is the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Multimedia ready, proven distributor, great 2007 gaming lineup, great to play. 
Cons:. Bulky Design. 
Summary:. Much has been said about the admittedly terrible launch of the PS3, however the reviews have just been piling on this wonderful piece of hardware far too much. It is a great system with a lot of power under the hood, 2007 will tell the true story, but if you can pick one of these bad boys up for 599$, it is well worth every penny.. 

$$;
Pros:. WiFi built in, flash chrome trim, blu-ray player built in+++++++. 
Cons:. nothing and nothing. 
Summary:. I think the PS3 is just amazing. From November 17th 2006 to a least 2012 this will blow away the competition.. 

$$;
Pros:. New look, sixaxis controler, interface, graphics and much more. 
Cons:. I couldnt find any cons with this amazing console. 
Summary:. First off I will like to say that the rating is so bad from everyone is because it was from last year and the ps3 wasnt even out how the hell do u rate something with out using it? I have to say this is the best game system out there because of it amazing graphics, sleek design, Interface, and its cool controller. I really hate when Xbox fan boys always compare between the two, obviously the 360 has the advantage its had a huge head start. Remember all the glitches with the 360 and the games didnt even look half as good as the first wave of ps3 games and ps3 just started and look the same as 360 games. i really like the built in WIFI it is very useful if u have wireless internet, u can surf the web download trailers, demos and bluray movie trailers. The games look amazing totally immersive, the six axis wireless controller is truly amazing its Bluetooth so u dont need to face the ps3. The bluray movies are just incredible, full 1080p makes movies real. And the 60 gig hard drive comes in handy when u put music onto the system, memory stick pictures, movies, and more. i hope u all enjoy the Playstation 3.. 

$$;
Pros:. The System has outstanding graphics and syncs very well with the psp. Is capable of playing various media formats. 
Cons:. does not come with hdmi cable. 
Summary:. I recieved the ps3 as a gift and it is the best system in my opinion. I also am the owner of a wii, while the wii sports game is very fun along with zelda, the rest of the games are worst. Most of the games are difficult and hard to play for the wii while the ps3 has extremely fun games with awesome graphics. The ps3 has great graphics unless you dont buy the hdmi cable.. 

$$;
Pros:. music, video, blu-ray, hi-def games, wi-fi, internet. 
Cons:. price, weight, size. 
Summary:. this is the best gaming system and beats the xbox 360 and wii overall. the games themselves might not be as 0ggreat as the xbox or wii, but it just came out. the games will improve and will get way better because of blu-ray. the graphics are AWESOME! and you feel like you are actually in the game. also, if u get the 60 gb version, there is wi-fi. u can attach a wireless keyboard (bluetooth or USB) and go on the internet and view videos on youtube and cnet. this is system is a powerhouse and you can practiacally do anything!. its definitely WORTH the money!. 

$$;
Pros:. the best console, Cell processor, 2 TFLOPS, blu-ray drive. 
Cons:. launched late, launched in less amount, motion sensitivity is not as good as that of Wii. 
Summary:. PlayStation 3 is undoubtedly the best video game console available now. The nine-core Cell processor alone makes it better than any other video game consoles. Motion sensitivity needs an improvement, though.. 

$$;
Pros:. WOW 360 DOESNT STAND A CHANCE SORRY GATES. 
Cons:. MAKES 360 LOOKS BAD .....KINDA OF PRICEY. 
Summary:. GET IT GET IT!!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Amazing I tell you!. 
Cons:. Did I mention amazing!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. I do not have enough money to buy a ps3 right now and also i can never find one. But I have played a demo at Target and when I saw the price I was stunned. Expensive! It is worth it though with spectacular graphics and a Blu-ray player. It is worth it when you think of the price of a blu-ray player which is usually around 1000 big bucks. I think that the ps3 will win against the Nintendo Wii and the Xbox 360 definitely. I will buy this when I get the money though. It is awesome..

$$;
Pros:. way too many see below. 
Cons:. just the swanky design. 
Summary:. Wow the ps3 is an excellent console it is going to provide bigger and better games than ever with its new blu ray capability. The nintendo wii is nothing compared to it. the xbox 360 at least provides some competition..

Pros:. sexy time... my sister the number 4.... 
Cons:. none... pure gold. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap Blu-Ray player, very good specs.. 
Cons:. Shortages and alot of technical problems with the first batches. 

$$;
Pros:. just look at my opinion. 
Cons:. it frezzes alot. 
Summary:. ok lets get this out of the way ps3 may frezze and yes it do. besides the fact that it frezzes ps3 has blu-ray and xbox 360 is charging a extra $199 (us) for just a hd add on. ALSO, another big one is ps3 will have FREE internet service that is big thing today. one more thing ps3 is back ward compatible xbox 360 is only campatibal with only some games. thats all i have to say remeber the ps3 is worth those 600 dollars think about it people. 

$$;
Pros:. The Future of video-game console...too powerful to be compared to anything that is currently out. 
Cons:. the launch price but thats it. 

$$;
Pros:. Up n coming titles, free online, fast load times, blueray is amazing, wifi, bluetooth, Easy to install other OS, online updates, I could do this all day.. 
Cons:. no rumble right now, doesnt upconvert ps2/DVD's but a update could fix this issue so it still gets a 10. 
Summary:. A year from now anyone talking trash about the PS3 will stick their foot in their mouth. You can only see the true beauty of this console on a HD tv Thank you XBR3. Just think a few months down the road after all the updates/patches how much better this system will be than it already is. After configuring your ports correctly on your router the PS3 network is not bad at all. + its (free). Gaming online against others is just easy and fun lag free for me after opening correct ports. Ps3 has a great community. People complain about how their are no games, but my goodness guys look at the line up for the next 3 months down the road. Imba system. PS3 controller will always be the best controller. Cant improve prefection. I try to find reason to complain or dislike the ps3 after being a 360 owner but I cant and I cannot argue the fact that ps3 is just better than the 360. Blueray DVD player on the ps3 is much better than I ever thought it would be. Can someone say PQ. Whats funny is that after a year or two blue ray will look even better than it does now becuase there is extra space on the disc for even more detail.This is scary stuff becuase im already blown away. Sorry HDDVD owners your number is up there isnt enough space on your disk. For 600 bones the ps3 is worth it. If you add the price of all the add ons for the 360 you will pay well over 600 bucks. Sorry guys anyone trying to defend the 360 is just sadly confused and must not be a ps3 owner. Sony is paying gamers back in full.. 

$$;
Pros:. much better than Xbox 360. 
Cons:. no problems with me. 
Summary:. i love this system. i have been waiting a long time for this. it has been well worth the wait..
