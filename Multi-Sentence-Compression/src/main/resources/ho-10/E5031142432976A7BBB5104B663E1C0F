if i had n't had a cooked breakfast ( which usually i do n't ) i would have been very happy with the cereals , fruit and pastries on display .
e , cheaper ) rooms are in the servants ' quarters , but are of a very high standard , well-equipped , with sheets and towels of the best quality .
there is a large lawn in front of the house , on the other side the garden slopes steeply down to a landscaped area with a stream running through , with a series of mini-weirs .
the house itself is interesting , with a charming reception room on entering , although oddly with the principal staircase in a separate area on the other side of the wall .
these gardens are beautifully maintained and one can walk through to the large kitchen garden , which is obviously still in daily use .
while architectural purists might cavil at some of the later alterations it is a lovely sight , especially in the afternoon autumn sunshine .
the bathroom was also excellent , although the height of the ceilings ( it being the servants ' quarters ) meant that neither of us could stand completely upright in the shower .
some of the bedrooms are up quite steep flights of stairs , which anyone with mobility problems may wish to note .
contrary to the experience of some reviewers , our breakfast was excellent and served promptly .
when the house was converted into an hotel , bedrooms were tucked into every possible corner , so i doubt if any one is the same as the other .
