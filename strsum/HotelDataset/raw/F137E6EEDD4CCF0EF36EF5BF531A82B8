we stayed at this hotel for two nights during our two week trip around china .
we had a pleasant stay here , although it has to be said that the front desk staff could be more polite and more efficient .
positives : - large nicely decorated rooms .
we asked for a city view room and we were located on the 25th floor with great views over the city .
- large bathrooms with a nice shower .
- central location , just a short walk fro the bund and its amazing views .
- nice breakfast with a great selection of western and chinese options .
the breakfast area also has an amazing views of pudong , the shanghai skyline .
if i were worming at the hotel , i would publicise this a bit more .
negatives : - check in process was slow , we had to wait about 20 minutes and they didnt seem to be very bothered .
- even after checking in , our key didnt work and they looked at me as if i were crazy and did t know how to use it , even after the maid had also tried and failed .
- whilst the hotel is located near the bund , it is between metro stops , meaning that the closest metro station is a good 20 minutes walk .
we ended up taking taxis to get around the city as they were so cheap .
ask reception to write down the destination for you in chinese .
- the coffee machine in the breakfast area did t seem to work properly .
when speaking with another customer who frequented the hotel , he said it had been like this for ages .
also , the coffee that did come out was pretty awful .
this is only a minor point , but one that could be easily addressed by staff and management .
- the shower screen hadnt been cleaned properly , again , something simple that makes a huge difference in appearance .
in conclusion , this hotel is a great place to stay in the centre of shanghai , however , the staff need to receive a bit more training on customer service as they make you feel unwelcome and as if you were doing them a favour .
for this reason i have given them 3 stars instead of 4 .
