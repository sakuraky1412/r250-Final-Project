i am a p  .
and i use it for work  .
it has served me well .
going from analog to digital with this dvd camera is initally difficult from an editing standpoint using    rw disks  .
write once (    r) disks were fine , but i preferred to be able to keep using the disks over to save $$$$  .
of course , the digital images shot were 100 times better than the analog i is use to  .
(i never tried digital tape)  .
re   editing software , even sony technicians instructed me to get different software from what they provided  .
powerdirector    4 solved all my problems .
i remember paying 1200 for this piece of work now it's 400 buyers beware for 400 $ you can buy a hd 40gb jvc camcorder and save yourself money and headaches i will give this camera away to my kids to play with .
nothing in the box tells you that you cannot actually make a dvd from the movie you shoot  .
you cannot play back the mpegs that are created from the software , image mixer that is included because the format using some uncompatible sound format  .
you cannot rip the ifo file off because it's encrypted  .
i have spend days and days and this camera is a complete waste of time and money  .
do not bother .
i shall never , ever , i repeat , ever purchase another sony product for the remainded of my life  .
besides further aggrevating me with runaournd brainles emails form tech support , sony knows they screwed up releasing this camera  .
it's obviouse by looking at the newest models that quickly replace this family  .
but hey , let's hit the bad points 1  .
horrible indoors    my 1996 rca vhs    c does 100x better and i bought it for 200 bucks , not 800 2  .
does not capture fast action without pixel    jizzle  .
(cant really explain the term , but blurry blocks while in fast motion 3  .
screwy software , no suprise , and screwy audio/video codec that does not work with hardly any app except the pixela , which what in the world does this program really do besides convert the screwy format to mpeg    2 with even worse quality  .
20mins in high qaulity , false advertisment on the 60 min  .
dvd    rws , they are double    sided for god sakes  .
you have to flip them over to use the other 30min  .
give me a break  .
blantanly lies about superior video qaulity stated in the advertisments  .
like mentioned earlier my 1995 cam has better color reproduction anywhere anyplace and antyime 6  .
sony basically told me to go sit on a pole because their products are perfect oh yeah one good thing is that it takes barely acceptable video outdoors in noon sunlight this camera is way to leaning on the infrared light sources even after disabling all infrared features , color reproduction is horible , example pinks are peach , purples are grey , sony should be sued for ripping off america bottom line bad sony  .
bad go to you room  .
i'm willing to trade for the panasonic dvd that is 200 bucks cheaper than my sony  .
or even one of the older sony digi 8s , back when sony made a good product  .
i hate my camera , and i'm stuck with it  .
this camera sucks so bad , even the dealers on ebay have difficulty finding suckers and if you reading this sony , i tried for 4 months for you to resolve this issue , and all i have it the pole you told me to go sit on .
Small &#38; Lightweight, Easy to Shoot Video; Small Toggle "Stick" is a Pain to Control for Menu Items
Sony quality hardware; 250 characters are not enough to write the cons. Pixela software required to download the vids to computer =&gt; NOT Vista or Mac compatible. Unreliable video format and duration. Expensive dvds. Sony/PIxela will charge (about 80 $) if you ever loose the CD
You can record three disc or more on one battery charge.; See novel bellow, too many to list.
It is small.; I takes about a min. to changa DVD's. In my line of work that can be 59 sec. too long!!!!
