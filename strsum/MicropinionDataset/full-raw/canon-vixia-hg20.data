the canon vixia hg20 is an excellent camera which can be used for multipurposes    a still camera and a video camera  .
the still camera is poor in definition and it is very vulnerable to movement , so the photo quality may be a little shaky  .
the video function is absolutely outstanding as it has an optical image stabilizer , so unlike the still camera , the video will resist continuous jerky movements like the ones when in a car  .
the video function has unbeatable high definition audio and video  .
even though the video has full hd (1920x1080) , it reduces significantly in darker environments  .
the handycam has an incredible 60 gb hdd , which eliminates the trouble of having to record it on millions of mini    discs , and cassettes  .
the rotating lcd display lacks visual quality , but it serves its purpose as a visual in    camera display for quick viewing  .
the safety strap not only fulfills its purpose in terms of safety , but it also re    defines elegance and extreme comfort  .
it provides a usb ports to sync its avchd video files to a computer , a hdmi port to view videos taken on the handycam on a hdtv , through a hdmi cable , or a normal component cable  .
it provides an external flash input , and an extraordinary zoom lens with a whopping 12x zoom  .
it also provides an sd port where you can save all your videos on that , as an alternate storage option  .
the camera is sleek , with a chrome finish and curves all over the camera  .
the battery on the camera is very poor as it can only withstand about 95 minutes of constant recording  .
the on/off button is sometimes hard to access because its (very) small size  .
the format of the videos are no longer a painful format , because wmp and other media players are fully compatible with avchd videos  .
the software which comes with it (imagemixer se) is sometimes a pain because it does no tell you where it has saved the videos  .
the hd cmos sensors compete with ccd sensors , but overall beats the ccdd sensors , giving you the best image quality there is  .
overall , the canon vixia hg20 is an outstanding video camera  .
i highly recommend it  .
have had the camcorder for about 6 months now  .
every day i relish the ownership of this great camcorder  .
i am capturing every moment of my growing kids at home as well as our various trips outside  .
outdoor shoots are just amazing just like the hd cable channels  .
indoor shoots are also very good  .
sony is just way too expensive  .
would recommend this camcorder to every household .
this camera is awesome  .
the footage it takes is crystal clear and the microphone catches audio very well  .
i plan on buying a light , mic , and tripod and will have a very professional set up for under a grand  .
well done canon , well done .
here is a video of the quality in 24p http  //www  .

yes buy one right now , but shop for it and look for a good price like i did b h is a good place 300 cheaper than most1 shop wisely but this is a noce hd vid box for the price  .
you'll see when you make your first vid and make a dvd and watch on a hd tv .
the cmos sensor has its overall limitations , but its comparable speed makes for excellent frame rate recordings as well as higher shutter    speeds for an excellent built    in still capture feature my full review of the product can be found here    .

cid  1319  .
this is the first camera i have gotten in a long while (my last is a sony digital8) , and the first high    definition camera  .
i is blown away by the image quality       comparable to broadcast footage in my opinion (and i think it may have received higher ratings than the canon xh    a1 in that category)  .
other people have complained that this camera seems big , but honestly i think it is very small (at least to what i'm used to)  .
any smaller and it would be difficult to hold steadily  .
other reviewers have also said the camera feels cheap and plasticy , however , i think it feels well built  .
all of the manual controls for the camera are very nice as well  .
i don't think the lack of inclusion of a mini    hdmi cable is such a bad thing as some people make it out to be ; the component cables give equivalent quality and i doubt anyone could really tell a difference (okay , it depends how high quality each cable is made there's a cnet article on it somewhere ) the only things that one might not like with the camera is its fairly short battery life  .
low light performance is not terrible , although any camera with a small ccd (meaning under $5000) is not going going to have perfect quality there  .
i have to say though , after actually watching the footage on a television , i've decided the noise looks much worse on the lcd on the camera than it does on the recorded video  .
i don't know if this is because it has not been processed yet or what , but there is definitely a difference  .
also a bit of a problem       and i'm not sure many people would care about this much       is that the 24p and 30p require a bit of processing to get the full    quality image out of  .
this is because it stores video recorded in these modes in a 60    interlaced container  .
i guess some televisions can remove it from this container (mine cannot) , but i am not aware of an editing program that can automatically correct this because it does not include flags in the files to indicate it should  .
(unlike some higher    end canon cameras)  .
i emailed canon if they would mind including the fix in a small firmware update but got a list of video editing programs instead  .
it's not too bad if the video is not corrected , just it may look a bit stuttery  .
i'd honestly just stick to recording 60i format since most everything can handle that pretty easily .
i have owned or used over 5 different brands of hd camcorders over the past few years , most recently is the new panasonic hidef hd camcorder and that thing is pathetic  .
i had 2 of them b4 i finally i returned it and got my money back  .
i did have the canon vixia hg 30 and loved it  .
i bought it after the panasonic , and after having a hard drive camera i didn't like going back to a mini dv like the hg 30  .
that is the only problem with it and when i learned that canon is coming out with basically the same thing in a hard drive version , i returned it and waited for this one to come out it to me is in a class of quality all by itself  .
the color , clarity ( both still and moving scenes) , the instant focus , fit in hand ( i have huge hands ) , easy to use buttons  .
easy menu to navigate  .
great features i love to be able to grab it when the kids are doing something cute or funny , and within seconds it is recording  .
i don't have to worry if i am recording over something like i would in a min dv tape format all in all , it's the amazing steady clear shot , that does not go out of focus with every little movement , and the great color that is best about this camera .
despite some annoyances , this is a great overall camera , very easy to use , with many options , and that takes excellent videos .
i found this 10% off all canon vixia hg20 neck strap hand strap from http  //www  .

enjoy  .
the first time i hooked it up to my hdtv i is blown away at the quality of the picture  .
never before has my driveway , backyard , neighbors dog , etc  .
looked so good  .
i cannot wait to get some real footage of my kids to play around with  .
it took me awhile to decide between an hd camera vs sd  .
i finally decided on this because the price is decent plus i fugure it is more future    proof than the best sd cam i is looking at  .
so far i have no worries whatsoever about having bougt this hg    20 .
it's a great camera , that i would recommend not only to beginners but professionals as well  .
i also work with a sony z5u and the quality compared to the sony is close .
i thoroughly enjoy the camera  .
it comes on quickly and you can begin shooting within seconds  .
i purchased it for family functions and travel  .
i wish the zoom is greater       only 10x  .
the camera is so small and lightweight that the hard drive on the side is not a issue  .
the 60 gb of space along with the sd slot is a great combination .
great cam  .
i would recommend it for anyone who likes great film quality without the price and hassel of difficult controls  .
get one and have fun .
for my first hd camera , i really did pick a good one  .
the quality , space and brilliant zoom focus all for $799 cad is really hard to turn down .
excellent camcorder with a poor software  .
that is all i have to say about this camcorder easy to use , the joystick is good to browse can change to photo from video and vice versa very easily and fast sp mode itself is soo good that i mostly use this mode as it gives 22hrs of video with this 60gb of hard disk the video recordings are stored with some m2ts format and to copy it you would have to use the canon software which is not at all user friendly  .
and moreover if u want to convert to avi or wma u wud have to buy some other softwares  .
but that is a problem with every hd videos updated  .

this is a terrific camera  .
the quality is excellent  .
very intuitive menu that is easily maneuvered with the joy stick on the viewfinder  .
the stabilizer is superb  .
i've never seen one so good , even on prosumer cameras  .
on    camera microphone good  .
i do not like where the inputs are or the little rubber tabs that close off the ports when not used    but it is a very small camera    so where are you going to put jacks  .
the battery cannot be changed out when the camera is mounted on a tripod    the battery release latch is under the tripod mount  .
that's a big bummer  .
the battery that ships with the camera will shoot for about an hour    with moderate use of the zoom    my moderate use is my son's ymca basketball game  .
the video is incredibly clear    edits fine in adobe premiere cs4    dual core laptop running vista  .
plug camera into computer and it shows up just like an external hard drive (which it is)  .
files transfer via usb very quickly  .
i can see where in the sunshine it would be difficult to see the monitor    but that's not a deal breaker either    cannot see spending several hundred for the model up that has a viewfinder  .
overall , very well pleased and would recommend it highly  .
biggest beefs    but not deal breakers   short battery life on ship battery ; battery release in wrong place for tripod mount ; little rubber port covers are aggravating when things are plugged in    the rubber tabs are sort of in the way ; incredible video camera with mic jack  .
stabilizer simply amazing  .
oh    one last thing    the still shot button is on top of the camera    how i find myself holding the camera    which is often at waste level , the still shot button on top of the camera should have been the 'record' button or be the record button when it's in the video mode and the still shot button when it's in still shot mode  .
(the record button is on the back of the camera and when the camera is gripped with fingers through the grip handle , record is a thumb button    activated with one's thumb  .
not always is my camera at eye level which i shoot  .
again , not a deal breaker    just not smart engineering    top button should have been an alternate record    just as the canon xl    2 has one on top , one near the grip  .
i ordered my camera from amazon and saved about $400 from the local big box store  .
got a heck of a deal  .
very well pleased overall  .
if i had to make the decision all over , i'd go with this camera again .
regarding software , when i could finally download movie clips to use in my old software (i had to convert them first) i discovered i could not get any sound  .
i understand that the dolby sound is preventing this  .
i finally bought adobe elements 7 with premier elements to edit the clips  .
this is a good choice , lots of features and i got elements bundled in to upgrade my older elements program    awsome  .
still , i my computer could not recognize my camcorder when i enabled it  .
i used the old software to import the clips from the camera then pulled them from a common folder  .
maybe eventually i will get this figured out  .
for me , i do not see this as an issue  .
i love the whole process of editing and look forward to shooting auto racing events and other creative projects .
over all its a great machine specially for 486$  .
this camera is a great deal compared to other similar cameras from sony or panasonic  .
on top of everything else , i liked how well it works in indoor lights (even in evening)  .
canon should add a second battery for free , i do not think people mind paying maybe extra $25 for that  .
in my usage for last 20    25 days , overall the camcorder is ok except the copying of videos to computer .
good quality product but software needs updating to current standards .
it's great that this camera has such high    resolution capabilities  .
but what's the point if you cannot do anything with them  .
oh , right , you could go out and buy a bevy of 1  .
5 terabite hard drives to hook up to your computer  .
that would work  .
but many of us would like the capability to store 24 mbps images more cost effectively on dvds  .
apparently this cannot be done and how about a serious video editing program that can actually work with these images  .
i've been planning to buy an imac with final cut express but have to look hard and long at its ability to deal directly with this camera's output  .
so i guess that's the upside of all this , i will explore future purchases very carefully to ensure compatibility .
eh bleh yet , amazing video quality  .
this camera is useless to me  .
do not companies like canon know that 64 bit o/s for computers is widely used  .
heck why not stay with dos 5  .
1 programs  .
do not get it ; go for something thats easier to remove from the camera than this  .
i regret my purchase   (  .
beautiful pix and videos but if it is not easy to upload to your computer , then what good is it  .
do not buy this camera unless canon drops the pixela imagemixer software the software program has a confusing interface and is very difficult to navigate or understand there are no help folders or help files on the menu bar when the program opens (it says help , but that button takes you to the pixella website , which has no information other than a one    page product overview) an internet search for manuals , guides , user help comes up empty  .
pixella's website is a wasteland , void of information the frustration of spending days trying to learn this software is a reason to avoid purchasing this camera   canon says , sorry , we cannot help you with the software that came with our camera  .
