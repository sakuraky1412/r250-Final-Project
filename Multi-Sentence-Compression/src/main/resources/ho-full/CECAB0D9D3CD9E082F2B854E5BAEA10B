friendlyness all over the place , from front desk untill restaurant and pool .
for some reason tripadvisor just ressetted the review , so here we go again .
this stop over hotel we arrived at 20 .
00 hours , and we only booked in the morning .
the room was well prepared , we asked extra bed , was there , at no extra charge .
we boked 2 rooms travelling with a party of 5 .
we had a nice meal at the restaurant with 4 different dishes , that were all perfect , good soups , nice saled and unbelievable affordable .
we just fled out of a dump of another hotel in germany and were so releaved all was 100 % right here .
i agree with other reviews , this is not a new place , but all is clean , well maintained , and lots of space in the rooms , cupbaord for sure 3 big suitcases to empty , hang and drawers .
good beds , a sure place to go back to when in europe for business ro pleasure , also the wifi was working well , too good to be true .
a sure advisor this place .
mind you we came out of a brand new hotel were they forgot the rooms to clean , the food was poorly so this was a heaven for us to stay , perfect local wine , all so afoordable , of course i do not mean this is a cheap backpackers place , no sure it is not , this is good for week of holiday as well as . . .
