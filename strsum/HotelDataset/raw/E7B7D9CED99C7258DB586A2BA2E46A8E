this is one of the oldest hotels in saigon so they 've had many years to perfect the quality and level of service they offer .
staff are courteous and helpful when you need something - and even when you do n't !
the range of food on offer at breakfast was quite remarkable and possibly the most extensive buffet i can recall anywhere .
it really puts many four and five star european hotel dining rooms to shame .
catering for demandingly conservative uk and american palettes on the one hand to the 'extremes ' of south east asia on the other , there is something for everyone including a range of pho soup and fish porridge - which latter you have to try once and is actually ok after you 've added some fresh chillies to give it a bit more kick .
it would be quite easy to have a six course dinner for breakfast if you really wanted to be set up for the day !
the room we had was spacious , clean and had everything we needed for a three night stay and needless to say one of my two criteria for a happy stay , individual bedside lights , dim-able of course !
there is a pool which was something of a godsend in a temperature of 38 celsius and humidity like i 've never felt before .
the rooftop bar is relatively pleasant at night when the temperature dropped to wimpish 30 degrees with a slight breeze .

my wife quite liked the local 'crooner ' who entertained with hits of the seventies - hmmm .
the hotel is central with lots of local restaurants about.
