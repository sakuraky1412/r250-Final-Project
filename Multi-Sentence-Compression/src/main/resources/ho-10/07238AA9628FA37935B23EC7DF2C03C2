so - i would love to go back to beautiful chiang mai , but not this hotel - there are plenty of excellent hotels in the same area .
uninterested staff who seem to try not to talk to you and go off and do other things ( such as talking to other staff and answer the phone ) whilst they are checking you in .
blocking off tables for tour groups is fine , but not when there is no where for your non-tour group guests to have breakfast etc .
not a problem , except when you want to hand your key in there is a basket for you to put it in .
our room had a problem with small ant like insects - they do n't bite , but the fact that they would turn up every day , suggests this is a known problem that is parked as too hard .
there is nothing to stop someone else picking up the key ( especially with the reception desk being understaffed with uninterested staff ) .
i booked this hotel , taking note of trip advisor reviews and suspected that it would have some irks , but i am used to thailand and can cope with most things .
our room did not have a mini-safe but the option to leave your valuables in a safe at reception .
the hotel seems to focus on package groups - no problem , but you have forgotten the individual guests .
breakfast should contain all the usual buffet items , but you will be hard pushed to find a clean table or anything left - shocking service .
