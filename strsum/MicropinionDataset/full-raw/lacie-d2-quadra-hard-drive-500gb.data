perfect external storage for professionals that do not need to extra speed of a raid .
i'll buy lacie again  .
i positive experience with tech support is big thing  .
who care's what kind of hardware you buy when it works , but when the thing breaks down a good warranty and competent tech support is worth it's weight in gold .
excellent drive for the money  .
i run a lab supporting a number of film students , and i take really good care of all equipment that i own and oversee it has been my experience that lacie d2 hard drives work wonderfully when they work  .
you get excellent connection speeds , and they offer a great multiplicity of connection options however , if the drive does not work you will know it  .
i have seen many drives come through my labs , and the fact is that brand new lacie drives fail  .
not all  .
i'd say about 1 in 10 or 15 will fail within the first 2 weeks of use for that reason i feel that i can no longer recommend them to the students and staff because often they will lose all of their project data after getting the drive and using it to capture , or as a primary data source but when they work , they work really well .
a friend of mine owns a cheaper wd for longer than i had the lacie , the wd is still working even after being shipped cross country a year ago .
when the drive works its wonderful  .
fast backup  .
installs on mac without a hitch  .
power supply problem causes drive to fail to mount after time and mine cannot be used with the power supply  .
useless if this is your main backup drive  .
lacie uk offer online support which is extremely poor  .
raised support ticket for replacement power unit and no response after 5 days  .
still waiting for response  .
lacie drives are not cheap and the support should be much better .
i have had it for 2  .
5 years , and it has crashed multiple times  .
when it crashed i didn't lose the data on it , but it is a pain to have to go through the reboot/reconnect process over and over again  .
finally , the last time it would never connect again  .
it is officially dead , and i wo not be buying a lacie to replace it .
it seems like i need a backup drive for the backup drive of my backup drive our it took the failed drive out of its case and mounted it directly into my machine  .
its holding up for now as i back up all of my design files to our server and another harddrive  .
not sure if i'd buy another lacie drive again  .
this is the second drive that has failed me personally .
i would buy another for me , but surely i would not recommend it to anyone .
i do not believe this is a good product and will not buy lacie again as a result .
i'm still under the 2 manufacturers warranty and i'm going to see if they'll replace it , but from what i've read now , a replacement will just do the same thing  .
i won't buy another lacie  .
i have a 250g lacie drive and it's worked fine since i got it in early 2006  .
it still works like a champ  .
but not the quadra  .
once i get this worked out with lacie (and believe me i'm sure i'm in for a long haul) , i won't buy their stuff again  .
i just do not need the headache .
i paid a good buck for this d2 quadra but it is a waste of money .
sometimes the higher priced units are not worth the money  .
in this case the unit is at a premium price compared to other 500 gig units and still failed miserably within three weeks (probably 8    12 hours of actual use)  .
i could elaborate on the poor tech services but this summary is intended for the product itself .
lost all data  .
lacie is junk  .
do not buy .
do not buy these  .
the interface power supply fail rate is way too high  .
i have feeling many users hear the first sign of trouble    clicking    and assume drive is bad  .
not true  .
get it out of enclosure and connect directly via sata and solid power supply  .
drive shoot boot right up  .
the drives are not the problem , it is design and quality control issue that lacie is quickly becoming known for  .
in the past , lacie stood for quality , but these drives are wrecking havoc on that reputation  .
i will still vouche for the rugged  .
possibly the best fw drive i have ever purchased but it not intended for desktop file serving or back    up like the d2 line  .
in my personal experience i have owned three of these and two have failed  .
i have recently switched to a netgear readynas nv+ unit with raid for file serving and a free agent for time machine back    up  .
the free agent has the same drives as the lacie and is whisper quiet and came with superior software/support .
do not buy lacie  .
you will regret it  .
they have very poor tech support  .
they do not support their products  .
after your drive fails , and it will , they will make you pay to ship the drive in and then they will send you a remanufactured unit  .
do not buy lacie  .
i'm gonna have to gut the unit and attach the hard drive to my pc to retrieve all my files and records for my business  .
thanks lacie i wo not be buying any of your products again and will advise associates and friends to do the same .
purchased 2    what a mistake  .
after a few months blue light kept searching and computer would not make it to the desktop , often  .
i thought it is my computer  .
i finally contacted tech support after about a year who told me the power pack had to be replaced and it is past warrantee  .
i purchased a heavy duty one  .
6 months later i had to purchase another  .
i now have to purchase another power pack  .
i recently found the second drive and tried to connect it after 2 years    completely dead  .
tech support told me it's beyond warrantee  .
never ever purchase a lacie product  .
i bought this drive when another lacie started to show signs of failure  .
i transferred all my data to it yesterday it failed without warning  .
since the two drives that failed are the newest of four that i own , i can only surmise that the quality of lacie's product has declined trust your user reviews  .
do not buy this product updated  .
on jun 30 , 2009  .
after mechanical failure and complete data loss , lacie effectively said that's too bad  .
i'll never buy another lacie product  .
