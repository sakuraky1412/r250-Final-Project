we were returning to this hotel after some years and my smaller children were incredibly excited to walk the hotel dog , as my older children had done without incident some years ago .
i 'm really in favour of hotels with pets but i think warning should be given if they 're biters .
bramble is amenable around the hotel but when on walks can be desperate to grab the leather lead to play tug of war , and hugely persistant , with a strong jaw & grip .
unfortunately for my dog loving 8 year old , on the walk , the dog jumped up trying to grab the lead & she was bitten badly on the arm .
i was more shocked by the hotel 's totally indifferent attitude .
no-one came to check on her , no-one asked how she was afterwards ; no apology .
if the dog has bitten before then there is no excuse , and this should n't be allowed to happen .
if this is the first incident ever , they need to warn others with children as i 'm absolutely sure this wo n't be the last time .
hotel facilities and food are fine ; the den is more suitable to under 6 's but friendly staff throughout , rooms are well appointed ( except the hairdryers ) , spa is n't really on a par with many 5* hotel spas but most parents are just thrilled to get away for an hour : ) fowey town is absolutely gorgeous and totally worth a meander .
just a shame that management . . .
