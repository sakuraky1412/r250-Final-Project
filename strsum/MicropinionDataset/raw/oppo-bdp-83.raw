Pros:. I have had my Oppo player in my system since purchasing it from the company about 9 months ago. I LOVE IT!!! It plays every kind of disc I have ever put into it (I have a huge collection of SACD and DVD-Audio discs), and it has NEVER stumbled. BRAVO!. 
Cons:. I have yet to find a limit to the capabilities of this product!!!. 
Summary:. Discs load very fast, the user interface is clear and very user-friendly. Firmware updates are a snap! Best of all, the Anchor Bay VRS Chip allows great upconversion of letterboxed DVDs that were NOT anamorphic, so one can widen the image to fill a wide-screen TV. I love this player so much I asked my employer to make it the standard player on our college campus. Even on DVDs sourced from very old video tapes, projected on an 100-inch screen, this player makes for breathtaking audio and video presentation.. This is, arguably, the best audio/video product I have EVER added to my system.. BRAVO, to the wizards at OPPO!. NO, I do NOT think this unit is overpriced! It is worth every penny and I am very happy with mine!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Speedy loading, absolutely pristine picture and sound quality. Handles everything you throw at it including the latest Blu-Ray releases like Avatar.. 
Cons:. Cannot think of one thing.. 
Summary:. No question. The best out there. I would and did recommend this unit to my family and friends. My son purchased it and is quite impressed with the performance and quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. he fails to mention something very in my opinion important that explains why the price is so high, and thats the vertical stretch option this player has, useful if you want anamorphic picture without having to buy $1000+ video processor.. 
Cons:. ........... 

$$;
Pros:. Customer service, picture quality on BD, up-conversion of standard def material and dedicated stereo outs (DAC). 
Cons:. hum...? I really can't think of any at the moment.. 
Summary:. If your looking for the best blu-ray player on the market, buy it. If your not, go to Best Buy. Simply put, Lexicon packaged their $2,000 BD player using the Oppo BDP-83 for a reason. Oppo is what my AV partner recommend for all the people we do home theater consulting with on the side. If you don't want to spend this much money, get the step-down Oppo unit or the Panasonic 65.. 

$$;
Pros:. Build quality , Loading speeds , Dual USB inputs , Flawless operation , 7.1 analog outputs , Excellent SD DVD upconversion, Outstanding customer support , Intuitive menus , great packaging. 
Cons:. Optional adapter needed for Wi-Fi ( ? ). 
Summary:. This is the ultimate "put your disc in and push play" machine . It plays basically all disc media (excluding HD-DVD) to the highest standards bar none.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays all formats. I waited for universal players to come down in price, and even Denon cannot seem to produce a universal player for less than $750. The Oppo does it all, and does it more impressively than Denon. A better player does not exist.. 
Cons:. I guess this is where I am to complain about the lack of streaming or online downloading via Netflix. Not so! That technology could be what makes Blu-Ray players obsolete in the future. I see no need for it.. 
Summary:. Buy the Oppo. You won't be sorry. If I may suggest a reference performance test, grab a copy of Elton John's "Goodbye Yellowbrick Road" on SACD. "Funeral For a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding" will melt your heart.. 

$$;
Pros:. Absolutely reliable.. The best customer service I have ever encountered.. Superb performance.. 
Cons:. None. Nada.. 
Summary:. If you think this unit is too expensive, you don't really care about your home theater's performance.. 

$$;
Pros:. Met all my upconverting standards since I have a BIG DVD collection, loading time for Blu-Rays is very fast, and can play any Media Disc!. 
Cons:. A bit bulky, No Wi-Fi, Weighs a lot, may be "too retro looking" for some. 
Summary:. The fact that this player can play almost any optical disc media was the main thing that attracted my attention. I have a very big DVD collection and didn't want to end it anytime soon. Once I popped in T2 to test the waters, I was immediately blown away by how well it upconverts the DVD quality. The output was a cross between HD and regular DVD quality, which may not matter to most, but does to me because I play attention to little details like that.. Although I listed No Wi-Fi as a con for this device, there's a workaround that Oppo can provide to make it Wi-Fi capable. If BD-Live features are really that important to you, all you need to get through Oppo is their Asus Wireless Bridge Kit for about $80 bucks. I don't really care for wi-fi myself but it's one of the few flaws I found for this device. Some people might be peeved that its a bit bulkier than most BD players but I see it as a homage to past technology :). You will also be blown away at how fast it loads Blu-Rays. I compared it with my son's PS3 and it's very comparable to the Sony's loading time. It wasn't incredibly faster than the PS3 but it definitely better than some other Blu-Ray players I've encountered in the past. Lastly, I love the fact that I can consolidate my home theater gadgets; I donated a lot of my past devices (e.g. Sony Multi-Disk CD Changer and Poineer regular DVD player) and left the Oppo BDP-83 assume their roles in my home theater haven. Thank you Oppo for creating such a great device! Your design is like art and technology is flawless!. -Maurizio Maranghi. 

$$;
Pros:. By far the best blu ray player out on the market who cares about wi fi and other unnessary bull super fast load time awesome picture and awesome sound plays any format sony samsung panasonic denon take notice Oppo is one outstanding piece of gear,,. 
Cons:. theres is nothing bad to say about the oppo. 
Summary:. The oppo bdp-83 is the best blu ray player out there,,you get everything in one player, with these other players you get one feature on 1 and then they come out with another feature on another. the oppo has it all worth the extra money for this unit,,,. 

$$;
Pros:. Very solid build quality; attractive but conservative design, with brushed metal face; Picture quality is excellent using VRS chip for upscaling regular DVD, far superior to the 3 other brand players that I own; nice remote with full backlighting. 
Cons:. Lack of built in Wi Fi support; lack of Netflix or Blockbuster streaming.. 

$$;
Pros:. The sound is perfect and it's very, Very Fast. 
Cons:. Nobody know it and if you need to send it for repair, you have to send it in USA. 

$$;
Pros:. 1st class experience. From the best packaging I've experienced to the excellent remote. and finally the video. Amazing. Even DVDs look spectacular.. 
Cons:. Would like to see Oppo expand their product line.. 
Summary:. A bargain!! Firmware updates really prove they care.. 

$$;
Pros:. -Fast loading of blu-ray disks. -Excellent video and sound. -Extremely well built. 
Cons:. -Requires some configuration if you are not using HDMI by default. (I'm waiting on a new TV and am using component video for the time being). No picture will show until you go into the menu (with no disk in), and change the default input mode.. 
Summary:. Until you've tried other blu-ray players and experience what a nightmare some of them are loading disks (minutes waiting - NO JOKE), you might not fully appreciate how load time is becoming a feature that is going to be tracked by consumers.. Highly recommend.. 

$$;
Pros:. solid built, reliable performance, sharp image. 
Cons:. none so far. 

$$;
Pros:. Solid build contruction. Beautiful image and sound output.. 
Cons:. Nothing as of yet.. 
Summary:. Great multiformat player. Includes audio and video setup DVDs. Nice remote.. 

$$;
Pros:. - Stellar DVD performance. - Cool "retro" design. - Handles variety of file types and formats (including PAL!). - Very fast. - Great back-lighting on remote. 
Cons:. - Expensive. 
Summary:. When considering this purchase, the most important thing for me was DVD upconversion. The Oppo BDP-83 delivers splendidly in this area, and then some. I have never seen a Blu-ray player do such a good job of DVD processing. The picture quality of my standard DVDs is so good, I sometimes find myself forgetting that I'm not watching HD. The other most important things for me are speed and the ability to handle various file types and formats. And again, the Oppo excels in these areas. I can see how some prospective buyers might be disappointed over the lack of streaming and Wi-Fi. But for me personally, these are not important factors, so the Oppo doesn't lose any points from me as a result of the lack of these features. That said, there's no doubt that the Oppo is rather expensive. However, it's not like there isn't a great product behind the high price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays every blu-ray and DVD--no exceptions.. Plays virtually every avi, mkv, mpg, etc.. Very fast loading time.. Unboxing experience is unlike any other CE device.. Bottom line: you get what you pay for.. 
Cons:. It freezes very rarely on an avi file (but never on a disc).. 
Summary:. Everything about this product screams quality. From the way it is packaged to the way it is built, the Oppo is first rate. I might sound like a shill for the company, but trust me, I don't work for Oppo and I paid full price for my blu-ray player from the company.. I tried a Samsung BDP2550 and it had all kinds of problems--I wrote to the head of Samsung North America, Tim Baxter and he ignored me. I tried an LG BD390 and it had problems and the WiFi didn't work.. Oppo costs more but you get a quality HDMI cable (which alone could cost you $50), and you get a hassle-free high-quality deck. What is that worth in peace of mind?. Buy this deck if you want the best at a reasonable price. Oppo cares about its customers, unlike Samsung.... 

$$;
Pros:. The audio on this player rivals some of the over priced audiophile CD players on the market. SACD discs sound fantastic. Video is rich and detailed. It loads faster than almost all B-DVD players I've tried. Easy to upgrade firmware, great support.. 
Cons:. Not a one! I have no need to connect to netflicks like other reviewers, It meets all my needs.. 
Summary:. GET IT!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great picture quality from blue ray and upscaled DVD discs. Solid build and construction. User friendly set up and navigation controls. Excellent customer service and firmware upgrades. Fast disc read times and play.. 
Cons:. None that I have found.. 
Summary:. This is one of the best current blue ray and combination disc players on the market. If you have a 1080p high definition television/display of 42" or greater, you owe it to yourself to have the very best blue ray/combination player. The Oppo folks have beta tested the BDP-83 for about one year. The player produces exceptional picture quality from DVD's through high quality upscaling video processors and audio playback is also of high quality, this from a self professed audioholic. You simply won't go wrong buying this blue ray player. Very highly recommended.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super fast load times for both DVD and Blu-ray movies. Unmatched DVD upsampling bye either standard or Blu-ray players. One of only a few players that plays the MKV format. Audiophile sound quality that matches players over $1000.00.. 
Cons:. Does not offer wi-fi in the unit but it can be added by another unit from OPPO. Does not offer any media streaming or access to online services. 
Summary:. Simply the best Blu-Ray player available today. It does not offer the media streaming or online services but I Iive in Canada so I can't access the Netflix and other services anyway and I already have a media streaming device.. People complain about the cost of the unit but it has better build quality and comes with a high quality HDMI cable and a calibration Blu-Ray disc which are not available on lower cost Blu-Ray players. It also comes with the OPPO Digital customer service which blows away all other manufacturers. OPPO constantly releases firmware updates to add new features and improve compatibility with the ever changing Blu-Ray disc standards and features for rock solid stability. Most other manufacturers rarely release firmware updates often forcing the consumer to buy a newer model to overcome bugs in their products. I have owned 5 different OPPO models including the first model they ever produced which still works flawlessly today.. The BDP-83 comes with 2 USB ports making it possible to connect an external hard drive to the unit which will allow the unit to play avi, and mkv video formats along with mp3 and other popular audio formats and high resolution photos. For those not famiIiar with the mkv format like divx and xvid which are compressed video formats for playing compressed DVD movies. MKV is fast becoming the compressed format of choice for Blu-Ray movies as it maintains excellent video and sound quality even with heavy compression. I have yet to find an avi (divx) or mkv video that will not play. There are only a few Blu-Ray players that play the mkv format including a couple of higher end models from LG. The BDP-83 also plays burned DVD's flawlessly with avi and mkv video and I have yet to find a Blu-Ray or regular DVD that will not play. If you have a large collection of regular DVD's like I do you will love the quality of the upsampled video. No other Blu-Ray player comes close when it comes to playing standard DVD's. For me this fact alone more than justifies the additional cost of an OPPO BDP-83 .. Updated. on Sep 4, 2009. 

$$;
Pros:. Handles every kind of disk I threw at it. Amazing DVD upconversion. Very fast loading time. The upscaling processer is found in AVR's costing over 2k. For $500 its an amazing value.. 
Cons:. Does not come with wifi.. 
Summary:. This is a great buy that you will not regret. Compares well with players costing well over $1000.. 

$$;
Pros:. it's an OPPO. 
Cons:. people don't know what OPPO is all about. 
Summary:. OPPO is the champ. hands down. there is no comparison. any question of price is quickly outweighed by performance....and OPPO is KNOWN to be pound-for-pound the outpeformer. Biggest problem for CNET is that the brand name is probably meaningless to them. Those that have run Optoma HD72 with DVI on 971HD oppo know what's what. Oppo is the mark others would love to hit... OPPO is no frills all thrills. Anyway...get an OPPO you will never regret having the best.. 

$$;
Pros:. Universal Disc player. fast loading. smooth playback. great sound quality out of the analog outputs. great support from Oppo. costs 9x less than competing universal players. 
Cons:. none that I've found and I've had this player since before the public release. 
Summary:. For anyone with DVD-A or SACD library, or anyone interested in high rez music this player is huge. Not only does the BDP-83 offer some of the best blueray and DVD upconversion, but it is a true performer. With a regular CD via the analog outputs it is nearly as good as my PartsConnexion modded Music Hall CD25, a player that costs double and isn't a universal player at that.. Check out the Denon DVD-A1UDCI at $4500.00 or the Marantz UD9004 at $5999.99 and then tell me the Oppo BDP-83 is expensive for what you get!. 

$$;
Pros:. An all in one high performance disc player including SACD,DVD Audio.. Very good build quality.. Loads blurays about as quickly as DVD's in most cases.. Menus and hard button controls are very good.. Great service.. 
Cons:. No streaming abilities such as netfilx which would be nice to have in the same box... 
Summary:. The key attraction for myself is that this OPPO represents a premium quality in terms of video and audio performance at a decent price point.. Audio for me must include SACD and DVD-A as I have a library and am a fan of these hi-res formats.. Bluray and DVD performance is second to none ,that I have seen so far, and load times are great for bluray [much faster than PS3 experience]. For comparison I have been using a PS3 and an audio player connected to an Integra Processor,Sunfire 7x400 amp, and B@W speakers.. I am soooo pleased to have one box that does it all and without any need to go to menus on video just to play audio discs.. Finally I should mention that I bought this player as part of the beta program and have therefore had it through the debugging period. Each software upgrade fixed isses that users reported until the final release upgrade after which I have had no issues.. OPPO customer service has always been exceptional when compared to the usual electronics company experience in terms of both knowledge and reponsivness.. 

$$;
Pros:. pristine picture thanks anchor bay. SACD and DVDA through hdmi. Anaolog outs. Built like a tank. 
Cons:. Too expensive. No Netflix or pandora streaming. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of setup is fantastic.. Many advanced setup options.. Flexibility of different type of disc playback. Packaging was very well done. Player "feels" good quality. Worked with my Harmony. Worked with my Trendnet wi-fi adapter with no config. 
Cons:. For such a nice device it's hard to complain about the price, but it would have been great if it was a bit less expensive. 
Summary:. Overall, the device feels like it is good quality, it's fast, provides plenty of high end features and just plain works!. Firmware updates are a breeze (attached to network via Trendnet Wi-fi adapter)... no trouble whatsoever.. I'm only had the unit for a day and both Blu-Ray and DVD discs look and sound incredible!. I highly recommend it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Well built, sleek desgin, excellent backlit remote, quick loading times, front panel usb port for firmware upgrades. Great manual, easy set-up and menu trees. Excellent sound and picture.. 
Cons:. Expensive (but worth it) Amazon provides free shipping and no sales tax, while OPPO hit me for $17 shipping and handling. No way to watch Netflix or other services but who cares?. 
Summary:. After spending over a year with my upconverting Oppo DV-981HD I vowed to wait till hell freezes over to get a Blue-Ray player with the OPPO name on it. It was a long wait but definately worth it. Great piece of kit, American made and well executed. I can't recommend this company or it's products more highly.. Da Worfster.

$$;
Pros:. Well built, plays almost any form of media available by disc/USB, fast loading, great back-lit remote, easiest Blu-Ray player to run/update, the best DVD upconversion available, topped off by the most helpful/polite customer support of any company. 
Cons:. a bit expensive, only available online. 
Summary:. I have had MANY DVD players over the years (17 to be exact) and none have been as easy to set up (and update in the case of Blu-Ray players) as this OPPO player. It has a wealth of adjustments that can be tweaked for those wanting to do so, but it looks gorgeous out of the box too. Great build quality.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great! There isn't much not to like!. 
Cons:. none. Dont have any regrets about this purchase. 

$$;
Pros:. Seem like a good unit but I have not used it. It does not fulfill my needs.. 
Cons:. Not region free.. 
Summary:. I'll never buy another media player that is not region free. I have many friends who travel extensively, often staying in far off places for several years. They can't even take their media with them, despite the fact all were purchased legitimately. How about reviewing some region free units?. There are some great movies that will never become mainstream in the USA and therefore not available for this region. I can buy them from other regions but playing them can be challenging.. Protectionism? Market control? Digital rights management?. I'm not anti-copyright laws. I just don't believe that a person's investment in media should end at the border nor that the US has the corner on culture. That's embarrassingly demonstrated daily.. Perhaps multi-media would have been a better choice than "universal".. 

$$;
Pros:. Awesome picture!. 
Cons:. I'm going to return this only because I really want the streaming capabilities that other systems have. The only problem...finding a comparable unit that has streaming!. 

$$;
Pros:. Not much other than weight and looks.. 
Cons:. Price, audio is awful. 
Summary:. I have an outstanding audio and video set up. I compared the Oppo BDP-83 to a Sony s360, s560, and the entry level samsung. The Oppo BDP-83 picture was decent - but only comparable to the others. The audio is out and out awful. I found the two sony to be the best picture and sound - by far. In terms of audio, it is so bad that Oppo offers a $299 upgrade for it. This pushes the player to the $800 - $900 range. Why bother. If you want one purchase from Amazon and do an "A" to "B" compare with the sony - let me know waht you found.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays every format you throw at it. 
Cons:. Has serious difficulty with home mastered dual layer discs. 
Summary:. I've owned several Oppos over the years. Every single one of them has the same problem. As long as you stick with single layer discs, you're fine. But they are EXTREMELY picky about the positioning of the layer break in dual layer discs. For the most part, a home mastered dual layer disc will not play past the menu, and in many cases it won't even play the menu properly. I've lost count of the number of discs I have that will play on my computer perfectly (using PowerDVD); will play on a $49 Samsung DVD/VCR that I bought for transferring tapes to DVD; and crap out as soon as they go into the Oppo. I brought this to the attention of Oppo's support department several times. Initially, their response was "This is a low priority for our engineers." After posting a few reviews, they came back again with "This is all your fault." But I think for that amount of money it should at least play all the same DVD discs as my Samsung.. 

$$;
Pros:. Well built. Very capable, if..... 
Cons:. Easy to trip up, difficult to set up for full capabilities. 
Summary:. Unless you're a techno-freak who is partial to masochism, I'd get another unit.. I have one of their up-converting units. It's great - no problem, just quality playback. But..... Updated. on Oct 31, 2009.
