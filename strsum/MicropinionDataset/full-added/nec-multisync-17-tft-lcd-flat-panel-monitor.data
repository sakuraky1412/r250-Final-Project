one of the best 17inch monitors  .
i have had it for over 2 years and have loved it .
this lcd screen has been wonderful to me  .
have had no problems in two years  .
have not lost any of the color or brightness  .
perfect for movies and games .
i've had this panel for over a year , and i have not had one problem with it  .
none the moment that i powered it on and viewed my desktop for the first time , i is stunned at the brightness and clarity  .
colors and bright tones are displayed vividly on this panel  .
one downside are dark tones and blacks in general , as you end up viewing yourself staring into the monitor  .
this is not too big a deal for me , but might be for some one of the things that makes this lcd stand out is its general design and form factor  .
it just looks damn cool , as many others have posted here as nearly everybody else has pointed out here , 2 other slight downsides to this panel  .
the inflexible stand and crummy osd button interface  .
i is terrified when i first had to adjust the stand to my liking , as it is incredibly rigid and difficult to figure out at first  .
once you screw around with it for a while , however , it's not too big a deal  .
i generally do not move my monitor , so this is not a problem for me the osd buttons on the right of the panel are also fairly un    user friendly , but again , i do not use them all that frequently in the first place to me , the most important aspects when purchasing a panel were response times when playing games , brightness of colors , and overall looks  .
this panel possesses all of these qualities , and should absolutely be purchased by anybody looking for a 17 display .
i received this monitor as a gift for christmas two years ago  .
today , i'm still using the monitor as my primary desktop display , and i do not have any complaints  .
the monitor is great for gaming performance , and the color vibrance is simply outstanding my only beef is with the layout of the menu buttons , all on the right side and no indicators as to what each one does unless i get up and look on the side of the display  .
this is , of course , hardly worth mentioning , as rarely as anyone uses those display controls , but it's none the less an annoyance if you're looking for a great , inexpensive lcd monitor that's suitable for gaming , you cannot go wrong here .
after 18 months , picture quality still leaps off the screen  .
this is my first lcd monitor  .
i choose nec because of my experience with them in my line of work  .
bullet proof pretty much describes the service this monitor will give you , no matter how hard you drive it .
bought this just over a year ago  .
still no dead pixels  .
have played everything from doom 3 , halflife 2 , and world of warcraft and no ghosting  .
not even a little that i could tell  .
the glass covering the monitor is/was a great idea in keeping the monitor clean and from getting broken the stand really does suck  .
not much options with it but to buy a stand to put it on  .
but overall , buying a stand is worth it  .
if you can find it , get it  .
even in a day of 8ms lcd's , this one will hold its own .
Tremendously vivid brightness, design stands out from others; Inflexible neck/adjuster, blacks and dark tones turn panel into a mirror
The one piece of the system, that always delivers; Stand, has to be man handled, to adjust it.
