you should get a room that is as high as possible , not only because you will get a better view , but because you will also be further away from the street ( and potential noise – read my previous review ) .
with floor to ceiling windows , beautiful bathrooms and a comfortable bed it is more expensive than the intercontinental ( where i have also stayed ) but for the premium it is worth it .
this bus is direct from the airport , so there are no stops between leaving the airport and when you arrive – the seats are extra wide and very comfortable .
located in the financial district “kiddie corner” from the intercontinental hotel and coex center , this is still a very nice hotel .
one of the cheapest and less painful ways of getting to the hotel from the icn international airport is to take the bus .
i still think this is a very nice hotel and recommend it for those who want a high quality , clean , modern and well appointed hotel .
for those who are “diamond” members in the hyatt frequent flyer program , there is no lounge at this property .
the coex complex ( and intercontinental hotel ) complex across the street has a large number of shops , restaurants and services .
the starbucks that is just behind the hotel appears to have been changed to a “local generic” copy of a starbucks .
the hotel is located on top of the samseong subway station so you can easily get around the city .
