we booked two nights at the springhill suites ; it was our first visit to this hotel ; we were delighted and rebooked with them for our son 's graduation in may .
it 's much newer that the other mariott properties ( which are n't bad ) and the springhill suites as a very large parking lot which is a shortcoming of many other places .
the air conditioning worked well ; the wifi was free and good ; the room had one large flatscreen tv , and there were a generous collection of outlets , good for charging your mobile phones and tablets .
we are across the street from the public grocery store , and walking distance to many very nice night spots .
everything was booked and we were lucky to get a room anywhere , but we paid hundreds more per night than normal room rates .
our son is a senior and this is our last usc parent 's weekend -- we are excited and a little sad .
i have not seen this pricing practice from the other marriott properites in town , but i understand supply and demand , especially on football+parents weekends .

the lobby area has a nice free breakfast area , and at night a very socialable group hangout at the bar area .
both were booked and we found this hotel .

our hotel suite was a large room with a king sized bed , a room divider , and an equally large living room / sitting area .
the hotel 's location on the vista is better than good .

the shower and the bathrooms were separate rooms .
we just discovered this hotel .
