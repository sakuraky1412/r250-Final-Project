best traffic gps for users who care about that updated  .

on aug 17 , 2010  .

buy it ; garmin cannot touch this  .

have driven throughout europe with this model and it has never let me down  .

all of the relevant information you need is at your fingertips  .

essential on long journeys and the live services are great  .

when the tom tom go 740 live is used with a modicum of common sense it is an unbeatable sat nav system .

wonderful device  .

i would highly recommend it .

i have had my 740 live since august 2009  .

i can complain of the price however , the traffic service is nearly 100% accurate  .

the eta is close from the time you leave your destination to within a couple minutes  .

i cannot say that about the other 4 brands i have used throughout the years i drive quite a bit , , although every gps helps you not get lost , this product helps you get there on time , it even asks you what time you need to get to your location and tells you based upon current traffic whether or not you will make it on time  .

it updates your status every 3 minutes , i can be ontime , while listening to my favorite show (howard stern) and not have to change to the news station every 6 minutes .

after two days of use and trip to nc mountains decided this is best deal after researching  .

very accurate for distances when to turn , next intersection , etc  .

some tomtom service features close , but cheapest fuel prices omit a few stations  .

maps generally up to date , but do not show road closings becaue of construction even several months old  .

seems to indicate that you can use bluetooth handsfree , even verbally acknowledges call home       is that correct  .

but does not dial  .

any gps unit should include an altimeter , especially if it has up    to    date weather  .

i'm anxious to see how this handles streets and directions in hickory , nc , where street names inclued 1st ave  .

, 1st ave  .

nw (ne , se , sw , etc) , 1st ave  .

drive (ne , etc  .

) , 1st ave drive place , etc  .

all through 29th or 30th ave with the same confused names .

well well well another gps review    well i went though every single major manufacture  .

the worst is magellain , so now it's between garmin and tom tom ,  .

well they both have there pluses and minus i will try to keep the foucus on tom tom the one thing i really like about this unit is the google poi's you can really find everything  .

if it's not in the standard tom tom poi just google it from the unit (it has a cell phone connection though it's own internal device and you will find it  .

) that is wonderful if you are out of town  .

the regular poi (not google) is fast but a lot of it you have to load from the web on your own computer  .

google is the way to go  .

drawback $10  .

00 per month but at least you get somthing good out of it  .

garmin poi in models 350 , 660  .

775t is horrable  .

it is slow and a lot of it is wrong  .

magallan poi's were fast and better than garmin but that is it for magallan with tom tom it has it's own traffic service i really have not tested it out yet since it's been the weekend  .

however what i didn't like you cannot get detailed infomation on traffic in your general area  .

it has to be in route and only in route will it inform you if there is traffic  .

you can buy a rds traffic reciver and get the general traffic stuff from my experience with garmin , and magallen the tmc traffic is never worth a dime  .

however garmin is fair about it and doesn't charge for it  .

tom tom's antenna is a seperate wire with suction cups (just like sony) which really makes it a turn off especally with the $99  .

00 price tag to it the things i like about tom tom is the infomation it does provide  .

it gives you gas prices in the area , weather reports and the position of where you are at a given moment  .

garmin had the position you were at but it is not clear  .

it is more of what address are you at instead of the street you are on  .

tom tom is better is that area finding my address  .

true i've only had this unit for a day  .

but what impressed me is this unit told me exactly where my destination is (my house and my mothers house) now i understand thats only two locations but what an improvment over navtaq  .

navatq is off by  .

2 to  .

5 of a mile sometimes  .

already so i'm excited  .

(at the same time i'm waiting for my hopes to go down  .

) routing is good  .

the part i do not like about tom tom is when you do a recaluate it does not immidetally alert you by voice you have to look at it  .

garmin and magallen it stated recaluating and right after the calulation it gave you directions tom tom is silant about that  .

but if you look at it you will be fine  .

the postive thing about tom tom is it does alert you  .

5 of a mile of a turn comming up vs garmin only give you  .

2 of a mile to the turn easy of use well my whole life is complicated and i'm a computer guy so i get used to these things  .

for simplicity and better menu options you are way better off with garmin hands down tom tom has a lot of commands and it's button after button but what it does have is cool but there is a learning curve  .

magallens is a little better than tom tom (on navagation of interface) but on both of my magallans the screen kept on freezing up and it is very slow  .

in the last magallen i had for a week and the adapter broke in one week  .

thats why i brought this i can see why garmin is number one in the industry , it's pretty accurate and routes are good enough to get where you are going , but most of all it's simple  .

garmin also has a fair business practice of only charging you a one time fee for all map updates and now has free traffic service  .

if garmin and tom tom were one i'd be the happiest kid in town tom tom is really great with the google poi's i have faith that i can find anyting while out of town  .

it's routing seems good (which i really need it for) i hope at least the traffic on route is accurate  .

i would of liked to have had a more detailed list of events and not have to be on route but hey i've never seen anything work good anyway in that department things that matter to me that i would like to see improved is to anounce right turn now (at the turn) also when arriving at destination and what side of the street the number of the building is on  .

and to verbalize the recalucations  .

a simpler interface would be nice but i'll deal with that  .

would i buy a tom tom or garmin next time  .

time will tell i need to decide whats more important simplicity or more bells and whistles and of course accurate routes i ve had garmin all my life now it's time for me to try tom tom i tried magallen and i hated 3 units of theres wish me luck on my new tom tom i'll know in 14 days if i'm going back to garmin updated  .

on jun 28 , 2009  .

i have had my tom tom for a short while  .

i found once i brought the go home the tom tom home software needed updating  .

i did as directed on the web site and updated to the latest version of home  .

since then i have had difficulty in getting home to work properly  .

parts of the software like backup or operate my go do not function with the latest version  .

after five different emails and two calls to tech support , i find that this is a known problem with some units and the fix date is unknown  .

so here i sit with a unit that reports the maps are over a year old but i cannot update because that function is not allowed in the version of home 2  .

5 that i am forced to use  .

if i try to update maps , the web site says i need to pay 49  .

95 for the base map update and another 49  .

95 for the latest map  .

again , tech support has no answer as to when it will be fixed to use as is out of the box the unit functions well but if you get the series i have one of beware of trying to update and do not expect help as tech support has very basic knowledge at best .

quick battery discharge makes me turn it off when on the 100 mile stretch of the trip  .

costs 3x more than my laptop gps (delorme) and the only thing better is the portability  .

if lost or stolen i admit i would buy it again because of the bluetooth .

this is great product  .

updated  .

on sep 26 , 2009  .

my 740 live is the best  .

bay area traffic can be unpredictable , so the live updates are a lifesaver  .

i never leave home without my tomtom .

read my full review here    .

unletteredandordinary  .

com/2010/03/tomtom    go    740    live    it    tried    so    hard  .

html  .

i've been very disappointed with this unit  .

does not seem worth the cost to me  .

the expensive subscription service i've paid for is not working properly and i cannot figure out why  .

it's worst fault to me is that it loses my favorites on every update  .

these are important to me for navigating between remote locations for whitewater kayaking / mtn biking  .

think i'm going to sell it and try something else .

fffd  .

i will be returning this unit due to the price and inability to maintain a bluetooth connection and random reboots  .

steer clear  .

stick with garmin/magellean or look to other brands , not here  .

confusing menu , poor battery life  .

cannot depend on live services for a long period on mobile power  .

it seems that in nav units , you can have some features in one unit and other features in other units but never all features in one unit  .

if this unit had the hands free dialing that some of the garmin units do , i would be all over this one but again i wait for the manufactures to build the unit that i know is out there waiting to be built  .

voice recognition no good ,  .

double check any free offer  .

customer service person i dealt with , rude and very bad attitude .

i have owned my tomtom go 740 live for about 15 months  .

in that time frame i have had issues with re    newing my maps or live service and most recently my device has a malfunction in which it no longer will communicate with any computer for updates  .

i have spent a significant amount of time on hold waiting to speak with customer service  .

a different customer service rep every single time  .

i have to repeat to every single rep the same thing that i had told the previous customer service person  .

after going through the back and forth and tomtom stated that the unit is not in warranty so they can not help me  .

i would hope that for $300 a gps would last longer than 15 months  .

i asked if tomtom's position is that i is out of luck  .

you be the judge they offered me $10 off my next purchase  .

wow  .

super i would never recommend a tomtom to anyone  .

poor customer service and a big concern about the reliability of the gps device .

the product worked for a couple of months and then the troubles started  .

after working with tech support for several hours i had to send it back for shipping  .

they tried to charge me for shipping even though the warranty says they would not  .

after about 10 days it is returned but they sent me a lower model  .

had to return it again  .

finally got it back and the one they sent me kept shutting down spontaneously  .

so again i had to return it  .

i've must have spent 40 hours at least going to fedex , time on with technical support and waiting for the fedex to arrive (requires a signature so you have to wait for it)  .

asked for a refund but they refused  .

they have some good ideas but the quality assurance process is obviously very flawed  .

watch out tomtom may end up costing you far more trouble then it is worth  .

total waste of money  .

this piece of crap took me thru the inner city of paterson nj instead of using the highway  .

i even took it on vaction to wisconsin  .

it is even worse there  .

lost again  .

my wife got so pissed she told me to put that crap in the trunk  .

i used my sense of direction which is much better  .

the only nav  .

system worth any thing is onstar but that cost 30  .

00 a mth  .

, but it gets you there every time  .

forget garmin , save your money  .

if you like listening to the same kenny g song for hours while you are on hold , you will love the tom tom experience  .

sold mine , well worth the loss to be rid of this group of customer    hating incompetents  .

garmin's support is always 4 stars in my book and i don't know why i left them , i'm back now  .

my favorite experience , and this happened 3 separate times , is calling in to try , once again , to resolve the problem , being told they don't know the answer and that your case is elevated higher tech support  .

4 days later you will get an email , to which you cannot respond , saying that since we have not heard from you  .

(you have no other option but to wait to hear from them , there is no elevated support communication option for you the lowly customer) your case is considered resolved and therefore closed  .

i just loved that .

i had this for about four day's until i had enough and took it back to sam's club  .

the voice contol never did work and all of the places i tried on the where to were off by as much as a half mile  .

i do not think that this thing could find it's way out of a cardboard box since i heard that magellan is purchased by mitec international i purchased one of their new 4700 units and could not be happer , voice control is much better and the maps are spot on  .

the thing is this 740 replaced a nuvi 785t that is garbage also , both were so buggy that i could not stand either one  .

do yourself a favor and pass on tomtom and garmin they both are putting out junk , garmin discontinued the 880 just after six weeks of release , makes you think why  .

they wo not say i know that for a fact  .

i am a charter bus operator , and purchased 4 tomtom units  .

one of the units has a problem and i contacted customer service for repairs  .

they told me basicly tough luck  .

if the unit is past warrenty they will not touch it  .

instead , they wanted me to buy a new unit  .

i said no way , i paid retail for 4 units and i expected tomtom to have a repair center  .

instead , i had to find an electronics repair shop , and to see if they could repair the unit  .

so , in my opinion , i refuse to purchase another tomtom product  .

instead i will by a garmin even if it costs more .

today i want everyone to know how unreasonable , rude and unprofessional tom toms company is  .

i bought a tom tom go720 gps , and used it only just under a week and the screen decided to go very dim , i could not see a thing on it at all  .

i took it back to the store they said they will send it back to tomtom repairs and it should be replaced or repaired because i just bought it the other day and i had to wait 6 weeks for a response just for a small gps unit , well i got a call back today and made me furious this is after 6 weeks of waiting , sorry we can not repair the item because it will be too expensive to repair and we can not replace the item either as well , we can only refund the item which tom tom is not keen for allow the electronic store to do  .

now i can rule out that tom tom's products are made from the cheapest and bad quality components  .

my days are over with tom tom , shame on you tom tom  .

if your a stupid consumer and are willing to loose your money or wait for over a month for a repair , and at the end they wont repair or replace the item go and buy tom tom products , i'll be laughing at you , because its happend to me , but i would blame myself for not researching the product , after i bought it and then researched it i realised that tom tom is a joke and like a toy , and there were millions of unhappy and unsatisfied customers  .

this time im going stick with the garmins  .

the reason im really upset is that they were very very slow in giving a response , the sales people sent it off to them the following day so they recieved in a week  .

so why would it take you another 5 weeks just to give me a response and just say we can not repair it  .

that really puts you off  .

please do not buy tom tom products , i've heard sales people sometimes do not recommend to their customers .

do not buy the update maps  .

my unit worked fine until i plopped down $100 for the 2010 updat  .

after that my 14 mile journey to work said it will take 22 miles  .

then i try to use the voice demands and it does not understand any demands and then gets locked in a repeat loop from the device they had a decent product then made it much worse with their update  .

customer service stinks  .

they care more about explaining about the no refund policy than fixing my problem  .

i bought this device from bestbuy because of its live service capability  .

this service cost $10 per month  .

i live in the dc area  .

most of the time , i am half way through my 30 mile commute before the live service boots up and becomes useful  .

at the last renewal of the service , the system refused to take my order  .

i had to call tomtom customer service several times  .

no one knew what is the problem  .

i is instructed to open a new account and then the service did take my credit card info , but live services still does not connect and says that i need to renew my account  .

called customer service again , and is informed it would take 5    7 business days before someone could get back to me to see what is the problem  .

unacceptable  .

a $400 waste of money  .

avoid tomtom at all cost .

i get about 3    4 crashes a week  .

as in a restart  .

the device does now know where it is and sends you in a random direction  .

several emails and trouble tickets with tomtom have nor resolved the issue  .

stay away from this product .

if you're a mac user , don't bother  .

tomtom home for mac       the software needed to update the device       crashes constantly  .

when my device went haywire , it took their customer service four months of giving me the run around to finally tell me that it must be replaced (they have no repair facility in the us)  .

it is just out of warranty  .

they would not even offer a discount on a new device  .

navigation features like fm traffic updates are fee based  .

competitors , like garmin , do not charge extra for this  .

i had a terrible experience with tomtom .

since i bought my 940 9 months ago , i have been unable to update the map that came with it  .

endless elaborate error messages  .

support is useless with suggestions like try it from a different computer , turn off your firewall , make sure cap lock is off , whatever  .

same messages from office computer as home  .

so , nomap update service is possible , and support is completely unable or unwilling to really deal with it  .

if there is no easy fix , support is otta here the desktop software is dangerous  .

do not think about updating it if you do , you will lose functionality of the unit  .

if you can figure itout (i did) you can roll back to the earlier version want a $350 paperweight  .

buy a tom tom  .

that's what i did and i have to say , it is not even heavy enough to be a really good paperweight if it's windy go with garmon .

i've been using pda/cellphone gps software for several years and the tomtom navigator products i thought were the best in terms of ui , stability and general ease of use  .

i had resisted getting a dedicated gps unit until i saw the go 740 live as i wanted as much as possible a stand    alone system that integrated traffic and extensive poi search unfortunately the go 740 live has so far been a major dissapointment  .

first off i cannot figure out the traffic service  .

i live in a major metropolitan area where i can get mobile traffic coverage from several sources (google , livesearch , telenav , sigalert , ) and even tomtom navigator 6 worked pretty well  .

as far as i can tell the service supported the go 740 live is probably missing half the traffic incidents reported by the other services , including the tomtom navigator 6 software  .

evidently they changed the data service provider for the go 740 live and it doesn't work the next issue is the constant reboots  .

about once a day (while driving of course) , the device resets itself  .

this appears to be related to when the device is connecting to the tomtom live network  .

if the device cannot connect to the tomtom service it seems to resort to a reboot at some point (annoying and dangerous when driving , particularly in the dark as during reboot it flashes to full intensity) the 740 live is also supposed to pair with a cell phone to handle calls  .

however the binding only works half the time or so  .

when the go 740 live powers up it does not always connect automatically  .

sometimes i have to manually reset the go 740 live before it will work again  .

there's also no way of activating the phone's built    in voice recognition from the tomtom ui while the google search is a great feature , there's no easy categories to select from  .

you cannot with a few clicks find all pizza restaurants along the route  .

you'd have to type in pizza on the small keyboard , which is not easy on the small keyboard when driving , so either pull over or do what i do and use the far better interface on garmin xt that i'm now running on my phone   ) finally , what's wrong with using standard usb connectors  .
