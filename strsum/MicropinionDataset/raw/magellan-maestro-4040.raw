Pros:. GREAT DIRECTIONS - UNLIKE GARMIN 350 &#38; TOM TOM XL-S. 
Cons:. Great unit... Have none. 
Summary:. I owned the TomTom one xl-s for a week and had to return it. (NO good in the NYC area) I was told the Garmin 350 was "hands down" the best in its price range and they were wrong. Was lost big time in the bronx, NY. Not a good place to be lost....I returned the Garmin 350 and bought the Magellan 4040 and could not be more satisfied... GREAT UNIT!!! Excellent directions without the crap... I am in sales and all I want is to use the bluetooth (phone &#38; and great navigation capabilities)... Have not been put on a wild goose chase since I bought the unit. Everything has been on the mark. This unit is so much better then the units I owned prior and can't believe the great ratings they received. In the north east I would consider trying the 4040 or 4050. I have nothing to gain from this recomendation but the quality difference is huge so I had to write about it. Good luck!! I hope this helped.. JS. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the accuracy and size of the unit. I carry it in my purse when not in my car. I bought this for $99 - refurb and really don't think I could have bought anything better for the money. It does what I need it to do, and a few extras.. 
Cons:. So far, after three weeks with it I haven't found anything I'm dissatisfied with, but then again I don't challenge it too much.. 
Summary:. I travel around to a lot of little backwoodsy towns and it performs flawlessly, however I'm sure there is still time for it to leave me high and dry somewhere. Again, for the amount of money I paid on Tiger Direct, I'm 100% satisfied and so relieved I don't have to map directions out ahead of time and print them! I have recommended it to quite a few people.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast start up , sleek design, screen size, accurate, easy to use, blue tooth connection to cell phone. 
Cons:. Battery life is under 2 hours. 
Summary:. This is a great looking device, very portable, rugged and easy to use. I use this for both business and pleasure. I can slide it into my briefcase with no problem for trips. It is very flat and portable. Set up is easy, worked righ out of the box. It connects easily to my Blackberry 8300 via blue tooth and makes a neat speaker phone. Start up is quick. The longest it has taken was about 1/2 a mile. This typically is when it is first turned on, after that it is within 50 feet of moving he car.. I find recalculations fast. It has a neat reroute indicator in traffic jams (when I am on the freeway going 5 mph for example) it suggests getting off and recalcs the route. Speakers are loud and easy to understand.. The screen size is perfect, not to big and not to small. Due to its size it can split the screen, showing the map on the right and the turn on the left side of the screen.. Great Unit for the price. I would definitely look at this company if I was going to buy another unit. I paid $399 from Dell Small business. Garmin could not compete on the value scale.. 

$$;
Pros:. This unit has a very good reliability for keeping a signal since Magellan has a contract with the U.S. Dept. of Defense and it shares a lot of the same satellites as they do.. 
Cons:. The bluetooth capabilities is not the greatest. The sound through this unit is not the same as using your phone. I found that some street names were not correct.. 
Summary:. I have had this unit only a few days and used it on several occasions but I'm very impressed with it so far. I bought it over a Garmin brand because I'm a police officer and I need navigational coordinates for many types of incidents I respond to. The Garmin brand is unable to give you that information.. I have found the device very easy to use. I have not lost a signal thrus far either and it doesn't take long to pick up a signal, even in southwestern Pennsylvania where I live that has alot of hills, tunnels, etc.. I have found the POI (Points of Interest) very useful for finding just about any type of business you'd want.. Magellan also has paired up with AAA to include the AAA Tourbook, which has many recommended AAA approved services (hotels, restaraunts, etc), and if your car breaks down and you're a AAA member, you push one buttom to gain access to their nearest towing service. It gives the towing service your exact coordinates so they have no trouble finding you.. It's unable to get me directly to my home address(misses it by a few hundred yards) because my street is in 2 different districts but it only says its in 1 district. I understand you're able to go online and add corrections, which I haven't done yet. Delivery drivers using a GPS have the same problem when they try to deliver something to my house.. I purchased this unit at Costco for less then I was able to find anywhere else. They also double my warranty from 12 months to 24 months. All and all, I feel this unit is definitely worth the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, Accurate, Easy to use, does what I want it to do.. 
Cons:. Battery life could be a little longer. 
Summary:. I am a regional manager for a multi-state territory and have needed a GPS unit for a long time. I've put it off for a long time just because I just couldn't decide what I really wanted and needed when reading all of the pro's and con's of the GPS units on the market.. Recently, while on a trip I missed a simple turn that set me back 2 important hours and I decided then that I was going to finally get a GPS unit. I stopped at Walmart and nearly bought on then but knew I would kick myself if I didn't refresh my knowledge of what is on the market now and as it turns out I think I was correct.. I looked at every possible thing on the market and one of my dealers told me that they could get me any Garmin I wanted at cost. So naturally I took a look at them but none of the ones I wanted did multi-destination routing which I greatly need. It serves no purpose if it can play MP3's or whatever but not do the main purpose that I need it for.. The Maestro 4040 was not available the last time I did my homework but with it available now I was very interested. It really had all the specs and features I wanted and I found a website that I could get it bought and shipped to me for about $393. It was www.techforless.com and in no way do I work for these people I just want to help out anyone else who is interested in this thing.. Well, I am seriously impressed with this thing. I've traveled through the mountains and city and never lost signal. If I need to or make a wrong turn the re-calculation was almost instant. I don't understand why the 'professional' review says it was slow as so far I've not had that problem at all.. The commands are clear and prompt with extreme detail. In hairy parts of the highway with important turns it tells you repeatedly everything you need to know without being too much.. Recently, I have worked at the New York State Fair and needed a hotel room when nearly everything was booked. I called up all of the hotels in the area and just went down the list and found one easily. I cannot tell you how much this is helpful for someone like myself.. Also, when you are on a highway you can easily see what exits ahead have hotels, food and whatever while your driving.. The visuals are perfectly clear during the day and night.. I didn't expect the Bluetooth feature to work with my blackberry but is does and it really amazes me. I can hear very clearly and amazingly so can the people on the other end. This is with it just mounted on my dash.. Overall I'm very impressed and if I had any critic it would be that I would like the battery life to be a little longer and I have big fingers that sometimes make me press what I don't want to. However, I've been learning how to work it so that it is not much of an issue.. I don't know about all of the other GPS units on the market and this is my first one but this is everything I've hoped it to be. In fact this is my first time ever writing a review and it is due to my surprised level of satisfaction.. Peace. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Features, Intuitive (easy), night driving colors, altitude reading (cool), loaded with options and features.. 
Cons:. Only VERY MINOR (see below). 
Summary:. My first GPS and love it.. Worked flawlessly out of the box and I am impressed with the price/value when compared to the competition. I see where some people have complained, but I have not experience any issues.. The cons are VERY MINOR... more like splitting hairs, but let me mention a few things that could be improved upon (very minor).. - The voice commands are clear &#38; loud, but a bit muttled.. - The screen will wash out when viewed at an angle, but perfectly fine when viewed straight (plenty bright).. - Would like to see the ability to program addresses / destinations through my computer ( I have a traveling job).. - User manual is a 70+ pagePDF file you must print. The following are some neat things I have found on the Plus side:. - The unit will automaticly recalculate a route if you take a wrong turn.. -Comes with a rubberized storage sleeve and AC adapter.. - Also extendes your warrenty by an addtional year (2 yr.-total) if you have a AAA membership.. - Very strong reciever. It locked in satelite coordinates from inside my house and away from windows!. - It will estimate your time of arrival.. - It detected when I slowed down on the highway and automaticlly suggested a detour. It must calculate the expected speed with your actual speed. I do not have the optional traffic module.. 

$$;
Pros:. Precise, on good visibility, user-friendly. 
Cons:. Power cord plug in on unit. 
Summary:. If you want an outstanding, user friendly GPS NAV system, with clear directions, traffic monitoring (upgrade), but without the MP-3, this is the system for you. I had it professionally installed. I absolutely love the Magellan 4040 and would recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bluetooth, speaks street names, AAA linked, very light and thin, many pre-loaded maps. 
Cons:. 2 hour battery life, no synch of cell contacts, robotic female voice, updates erase address book so an SD card is key. 
Summary:. I started my quest at Sam's Club. The only GPS that suited my needs was the Garmin Nuvi 660 for $599. A great price, but, alas, they were sold out. So off to Best Buy I went. They had three models that I liked: The Nuvi 660 for $799, the Nuvi 350 for $499 and the Magellan Maestro 4040 for $499. I had a feeling I could find one of them for a lot cheaper since Best Buy's selections were last year's models or the newer models all at higher prices. It's almost as if Best Buy boosts the prices and dares you to price shop.. I wasn't completely sold on the Nuvi 360 and the Nuvi 660 was just too much. Due to the TomTom Go910's out of date data base (even though it includes maps of Europe) I felt flustered and went home to do more homework.. The first thing I can suggest is don't get suckered into buying a GPS that enables you to store MP3s or store pictures. This is supposed to be a GPS unit - who needs to see a slide show of their friends and family while driving? MP3s can be heard on MP3-enabled dash units or portable devices such as the Sansa e280 MP3 player.. I liked the Magellan brand, so my choice became which of the Maestro series I'd choose.. The Maestro 4000 is the basic version and does NOT have Bluetooth. The other drawback is that it ONLY has maps of the 48 contiguous states. While this might be fine for some users, I like the Bluetooth feature and I travel to Canada once in a while. It runs about $315 to $400.. The Maestro 4040 was the most logical choice for my dad and myself. It has Bluetooth, maps of the USA and includes Alaska and Hawaii, Canada and Puerto Rico. European maps are an optional add-on. Since we have a place in Hawaii and we go to Canada, it was perfect. The traffic alerts option is available for the 4040 but is more expensive as an add-on than purchasing the 4050 (which comes with it). The 4040 usually runs about $499 to $550 (but see my Costco adventure below). Another great thing (for us anyway) is setting The Staples Center as an address book entry. We go to many hockey games but the place is located deep in the heart of downtown LA. Usually a traffic nightmare. This GPS will give us all sorts of alternative routes if the freeways are jammed or there's congested streets. I'm sure this would help most people discover secret ways to get to places they've been to a million times.. The Maestro 4050 adds voice commands and traffic alerts for the $560 to $700 price range. I thought that voice commands might be tough if I was on a road trip with the music on and the windows open and I already have traffic alerts on my XM radio.. So off to Costco I went. As I walked in, it was like the clouds parted and I could hear a Gregorian chant when I spotted the display for the Magellan Maestro 4040 for... get this...$399!!!!!!! That's $100 cheaper than Best Buy and lower than anywhere on the net too. I would strongly suggest calling your local Costco first to make sure they have them in stock. The SKU# is 204040.. About 15 minutes of set up time and it was all set. I just wish my Bluetooth cell phone would be able to send my address book to this GPS.. Plotting a Course:. All you need to do is enter the city, then the street and the address. Bongo - you're on your way. The screen will display either a 3D, a 2D or turn-by-turn maps. Of course, for those who don't have an exact address, you can enter an intersection of try locating it in POI database. For instance, let's say you're hungry and want to find the nearest Applebee's. You enter the name and the GPS will tell you were the nearest one is to your current position. If you're in an unfamiliar city and want to know where a gas station or post office or grocery store is, simple. Just punch it into the GPS and you're on your way. It really reduces my stress level when driving - especially in new cities.. User interface:. Gone are the bland text-only buttons. Thanks to a system built on Windows CE, the screen comes alive with vibrant color icons. Nine of them, in fact:. Show Map: Shows you your current position on a 2D or 3D map as you move through the city or town.. Enter Address: Allows you to enter a destination or intersection by city or state. It also allows you to add addresses or POIs to your custom database.. Points of Interest (POI): You can search by name, category, enhanced or AAA tourbook. Enhanced section allows for advanced selections and alarms to be set.. Trip Planner: For single or multiple destinations.. Exit POIs: When traveling the highways, the exit POIs will guide you top the nearest restaurant, rest areas, etc.. User Options: Here's the nerve center of the unit.. Once in the User Option area, you're faced with 14 tabs.. Region: Where you set the region you're currently traveling in.. System settings: Volume, brightness, language, etc. By the way, this GPS has English, French and Spanish included.. Trip Computer: for stats on your current trip. POI Selection: You can choose any or all of the icons to appear on your map. For instance, if you're headed to another city and get hungry, there are restaurant icons that will appear and if you tap one, it'll give you info on the establishment and their number so you can call from the car.. The extensive icon list includes, gas stations, restaurants, coffee, shopping, airport, bank/ATMs, camping, casino, city centers, convention center, education, entertainment, golf, grocery store, health services, home improvement, hotels, marina, nightlife, parking, public buildings, car rental, rest area, sports &#38; recreation, tourist attraction, transportation, winery and Other services. Again, you can pick and choose which (if not all) the icons you wish to appear on your route maps.. There are also smaller buttons at the bottom of the menu screen:. A house icon, which instantly routes you back "Home", a tow truck icon which links to AAA Roadside Assistance. This screen shows your current GPS latitude and longitude. (knowing these numbers is great for storing your own POIs). It also has the 800 numbers to call AAA. And lastly, a telephone icon.. The telephone link brings you to a screen with 8 more icons. The phone dial pad, address book, call history, redial, SMS (for text messaging), search for devices, pair with a device and Bluetooth. The last three are used to pair the GPS with your Bluetooth-enabled phone.. Design:. There are two body types of add-on GPS units available today. The thicker type that resembles the old CRT televisions and the thin style GPS that resembles today's LCD TVs. Of course, the thinner models are more expensive, look a lot more sleek and a few more mounting possibilities. The 4040 is less than an inch deep (front to back). Most of the newer GPS units have an integrated antenna. No more need to flip up the bulky GPS antenna any longer.. On the left side of the unit are SD card slot, the power button and the USB interface. On the right side are the headphone jack and power in ports.. AAA Club Members:. If you input your membership number into the GPS, the unit is linked to a built-in data base of AAA discounts. AAA destination descriptions (and be able to call directly from that screen), AAA show your card and save locations, AAA diamond rated hotels and restaurants, and AAA approved auto repair facilities.. Also, Magellan offers a 15% discount on Magellan accessories for AAA members. For those who do not have OnStar, this GPS will help you when you break down with AAA Roadside Assistance. All you do is call AAA via the Bluetooth on the GPS and they can instantly track your position and get you the help you need.. Even if you're not a AAA member, you still get the points of interest data base within your GPS unit.. What Comes In the Box:. The GPS unit, the A/C power cord, a vehicle (cigarette) power cord, a mounting plate for the dash, a well-designed suction cup / windshield mount, manual quick start guide, a protective pouch and a CD rom that also links you to the Magellan website for registration, support and more.. The factory warranty is ONE year and you can purchase an extended service agreement from the place you purchased it (except for places like Costco) or you can purchase a 2-year extended plan directly from Magellan.. What I love:. The coolest feature (unless you have multiple love interests) is the fact that I can couple my Bluetooth-enabled cell phone to my 4040. If someone in my address calls me or anyone displaying caller ID call, I can see who's calling on my screen without having to get my cell and look - thus, taking my eyes off the road for longer periods of time. This would be a bad thing if you're a player and have someone in the seat next to you that should not see who's calling. Also, if I want to call a P.O.I. or call anyone on my route, I simply touch a button and I can call them right from the GPS via speakerphone or my Bluetooth headset.. Unlike other reviews I have read about the Maestro series, there IS a volume control in two places. On any map, there's a faint icon of a speaker, tap it and have access to the volume control. This volume control is also accessible via the User Options icon in the main menu.. I love being able to plot (up to) 20 destinations in one trip and have the GPS optimize a route for me.. I love being able to use this GPS without a cable. The battery takes about three hours to charge.. What I'm on the Fence About:. My 760 has the option to view my route in split screen. I could see the route on one side and the directions on the other. The 4040 doesn't have this selectable view feature but it does display it when a turn is coming up.. The 760 has a selectable male or female voice. Not only does 4040 have only the female voice, her voice is not as pleasant. This time around, she sounds more like a robotic chain smoker. While this might not be an issue with the guys, the ladies might prefer to hear a man's voice once in a while.. What I Don't Like:. The 4040 doesn't allow for wireless sync of a Bluetooth cell phone's address book. So I'm forced to enter all my contacts by hand which is a bit arduous.. The fully charged battery life is rated at just over TWO HOURS of continuous use. That needs to be improved. Of course there are the AC and VDC power supplies for home and vehicle usage, but using it hand-held, it should last longer than just over two hours.. Each and every time I boot up, I'm met with the disclaimer screen about the safe usage of the GPS while operating a vehicle - ANNOYING!. Accessories:. Maps for other countries available on CD rom or SD card. I would strongly suggest getting a 1 gig (or higher) SD card.. If you live in a bad area for GPS signals, buy an optional exterior antenna.. They offer headphones for the unit, but I would not use them while driving as it is illegal in most states to block both your ears from hearing sirens and such.. There's also a long goose neck floor mount available.. Magellan was smart by adding a storage card slot (MMC or SD) in the 4040. Why? Because every time a firmware, map or POI update is available, they warn you that your address book will be erased. Why? Well, saving your address book to the memory card will enable you to restore all your info after an update.. 

$$;
Pros:. Big screen - quick satelite fix - shows pertinent info on screen.. 
Cons:. Traffic Kit - Optional. 
Summary:. Have used both this Magellan &#38; other Garmin units. This Magellan with it's large bright screen &#38; easy intuitive interface is really a great unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. It does every I need. It took me where I wanted to go. It allowed me to change the route and redid it. It showed me a better way to my son's house. I visit home bound patients, and it get me "home. 
Cons:. I have no problems.. 
Summary:. I really like the larger screen. The window mount works very well for our car. It actually rests on the top of the dash and. has no vibration.. 

$$;
Pros:. large 4.3" bright touch sceen display, excellent audio out put, AAA tourbook, TTS, SiRF, BT. 
Cons:. Not as much POI information as some of the more expensive units. 
Summary:. Magellan has done it again, the Maestro 4040 is a great contribution towards the PNAV market, similar to a 4.3" Garmin Nuvi like device that is a no nonsense personal navigation device without all the extras.. My experience has been excellent with this new products understanding ALL PND have it's limitations and challenges, the Maestro is a breath of fresh air.. The new Magellan user interface is very easy, practical and very intuitive, this is a huge change in direction for Magellan compare to the older user interface.. What is most pronounce and the biggest differentiator between the Magellan Maestro and Garmin Nuvi is that the Magellan Maestro now includes. 1] AAA rating guide which includes restaurant, hotels and many others.. 2] AAA Tour book which includes such events as Home and Garden shows date and time, Art and Wine Festivals date and time, Antique shows date and time etc,. 3] AAA branch offices for you to buy register your vehicle or make reservation with AAA travel agency.. 4] AAA approved Auto repair facilities to take your vehicle to if it breaks down when you are on a road trip, these AAA approved auto repair facilities are reliable and have to answer to AAA if there is a complaint,. 5] Camp grounds and RV park locations. 6] AAA roadside assistance phone number,. 7] AAA membership saver guide etc. Garmin charges extra for saver guide, travel guide, etc., which is included in the Magellan Maestro units. .. The soon to be release Magellan Maestro 4050 will also include voice command capability which is a huge feature enhancement, Garmin, TomTom and Mio does not offer this feature and only some of the high end installed GPS system such as Pioneer, Alpine along with some OEM units have some limited features such as voice command capabilities.. The Maestro 4040 also includes Bluetooth hands free capabilities along with traffic information as an options using the Magellan TMC cradle.. The Bluetooth hands free feature is solid and can import phone number from the address book or from POI and dial the number for you if a Bluetooth phone is paired with the Maestro.. The Exit Points of Interest is extremely helpful for users that is on a long road trip and do not wish to back track to find a gas station or restaurant. This feature is unique to Magellan since it only offers POI's that is ahead of your direction of travel and not what you have just past.. We did not find the reroute option to be an issue, as fast or faster than the older Magellan Roadmate 760. Routing from California to New York 100 Main Street only took 25 seconds to calculate and the unit was ready to route.. Bluetooth handsfree features paired up well with BT phones we tested with, huge improvement over the Magellan Roadmate 6000T BT.. With all the great features and ability, what is missing?. What is noticeably missing is Magellan Trip planner route optimization, Magellan retain the trip planner but left out the ability to optimize the route to offer the user the most efficient route from the nearest to the furthest destination in your trip planner folder.. The MP3 player, the photo viewer is noticeably missing but may not be a deciding factor for someone that is looking for a good PND without all the extras.. I have been testing this Magellan Maestro product for a while now as a beta tester and the product is solid and should be a winner for Magellan. Did not experience the lock up and slow processing issues as I have with other units we have tested.. Overall, the competition is getting even hotter, Magellan just raised the stakes by offering a no nonsense PND at an affordable price with everything one would need and nothing that you do not need for navigation purposes. For now, I would recommend the Magellan Maestro if you wish to have a large display unit that is fast and efficient at an affordable price. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, AAA tour book, smart address book, automatic night vision, loud speaker, text to speech.. 
Cons:. slow recalculating route, it does not drop a blue tooth device upon failed connection (you have to restart). 
Summary:. Great for the money. The Bluetooth is a plus for places with handfree traffic laws. AAA tour book is a great feature with one touch calling feature using your linked phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. I F'ing love this little unit. $99 USA. I got a Fu#@(%$ great deal on it refurbished. Like most cheap ass americans, if I can get it used for less, and warranted I am going to f#$%(IG buy it!. 
Cons:. You must remember to disconnect blue tooth manually when turning unit off. If you depower the Magellen while BT is still F#$%# enabled then you need to play heck getting it reconnected. By that I mean you gotta reboot the system all over. 
Summary:. Huge F#$%#$ display, awesome volume level and simple to use interface make this unit better than anything else out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen; quick to recalculate; easy to setup; easy to use. 
Cons:. The beep/chime at each turn is annoying. 
Summary:. Took this on a multiple leg trip today and was very impressed. First of all it acquires satellites very quickly, and the signals even came in strong when I was playing with it in the house -- away from windows. Would prefer a QWERTY keyboard option as that is how I know how to type. It gives you sufficient options so you can customize the screens the way you want them. Overall I am very happy with the unit. I have had a Garmin IQUE 3600 and a Garmin NUVI 350 -- this performs right up there with the Garmins. The mount is great to use; and the instruction manual comes in CD format so you don't have to download it from the site, like Garmin requires.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear Directions, love the Trip Planner. 
Cons:. Bluetooth needs work, cant sync contacts. 
Summary:. After a thorough search for my first GPS, something that was affordable yet dependable, i must say the Magellan 4040 did not disappoint me at all. I got this for a very reasonable price at amazon.com for about $220 i believe.. It does take some time to find its satellite positioning (about a min or so) dont know because if I live in brooklyn, but besides that it did its job from then on. Clear directions, maps are well illustrated, turn by turn directions are really good and so is its detour option, saved me a couple of times.. Okay besides the good stuff, the problems I did have was that the bluetooth is not that great, it works once its up and running but it did take some time to get it going. Also, I wish there was some way to sync your contacts to the GPS, I dont care about the other whistles and bells other products provide, i.e. MP3's, photos etc., syncing your contacts would have been a very nice feature esp. with a GPS that has bluetooth capability.. Besides that, this a very useful GPS, can get this thing for a reasonable price for a product that is about the GPS functionality itself than the whistles and bells of other systems.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast, simple to use, easy to see.. 
Cons:. Bluetooth is poor after upgrading to Rev 2.26. Error message.. 
Summary:. This is an outstanding fast simple to use GPS. You can almost forget about the user manual.. Does seem to have problems when battery is in low state of charge after revision update but may be just inherent to mine. Bluetooth not very functional after upgrading to REV 2.26 also. When I connect to phone I always get error message now "Connected to short message service failed." Don't know what this is all about but did not do this with original revision. Also echo and background with noise complaints from people called when using hands free bluetooth calling. Does not always understand commands either.. Do not like that Magellan does not recommend to be used on motorcycle. Not sure if they are concerned with safety or that it may get wet.. GPS does aquire satelites almost instantly and has been acurate in getting me anywhere it was programmed to guide me. POI data base is awesome. Finds everything I need so far. AAA also a great thing to have available while traveling. All in all I rate this as an excellent choce in a GPS for the money.. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, accuracy, and good selection of user options. Re-routing is quick. The Blue tooth feature is an added bonus.. 
Cons:. Sometimes voice intructions are muffled. The volume is good, but you will not be listening intently to your favorite tunes when your trying to follow directions. Simulation mode is slow.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS unit, and I am truely impressed with the sophistication of this unit coupled with its ease of use. The accuracy of the tracking is astounding, and it re-routes quickly if you miss a turn. I shudder to think what else one would want in a GPS Nav system.. 

$$;
Pros:. good text-to-speach, expandable with traffic and (eventually) voice recognition, nice screen, AAA. 
Cons:. no way to load address book, weak speakerphone, software volume control. 
Summary:. This is the first GPS I've owned and I'm generally pleased with it. Finding destinations and routing work quite well. Re-routing is a cinch too. The UI could use some work. For example, searching for a destination by name, you first enter the name and then the city. If you want to try another name you have to back up, enter the name then re-enter the same city over again. Overall the UI is like that; very linear with one thing following the next and no opportunity to jump around.. Quibbles aside, I like my 4040 and would buy it again. It has all the things you want and nothing you don't. No media players, or flying toasters, or whatever (why, oh why would you put an MP3 player in a GPS? You're in a CAR for crying out loud! Cars have STEREOS!).. 

$$;
Pros:. Input is fast and love the AAA options. 
Cons:. Roads aren't clearly on the map. 
Summary:. Love the GPS unit and found a great price at Costco. Used in recently on a trip and found it great. Besides it being very useful in regular navigation, the information regarding the destinations was great. As we were driving along, I could read about all the points of interest that were close by. By learning more about the attraction, we could stop if it sounded interesting.. It clearly shows the road you are on, but doesn't show the other roads around where you are.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent voice instructions. 
Cons:. green route color very difficult to see. 
Summary:. 6 months ago, I rented both Garmin n�vi 350 and the Magellan Maestro 4040 for one week. I drove around Silicon Valley and a 3 day trip to Californias central coast.. Like many reviews say, from a simple checklist comparison Garmin has advantages over the Magellan. However, after my test period, I purchased the Magellan 4040 (for more money then the Garmin 350).. Reasons:. Magellan gave much better voice instructions, allowing me to keep my eyes on the road, and not on my GPS. And the few times I did look at the GPS, the Magellans next turn direction was an icon in the lower corner and not hidden in the main screen.. After 6 months I still believe I made the best choice. The only real negative, is the Magellans light green route color. In bright sunlight or with sunglasses, it is VERY hard to see, against the screen's background! Another reason I am glad the voice instructions are excellent.. 

$$;
Pros:. AAA coverage. 
Cons:. none so far. 
Summary:. I had the Magellan 2200T previously, it was a good value but had it's problems. I've used Garmin's in rentals and found them very nice, especially with the traffic alert. Found that Costco had the 4040 for $299, a great value. It does much better than the 2200T's and the voice alerts are better, but not as good as the Garmin.. I've read a few reviews from earlier in the year and didn't find the same issue with this. I'm sure there has been a few software updates and current they have another update that I've yet to download to correct a few items mentioned.. The real neat feature is the AAA Tourbook. I've been a AAA member forever and used the tourbook in the the old stone age. This is very useful when traveling. It gives reviews of accomodations during your travel, ABOUT TIME! How many times have you tried to find a good restaurant or hotel during your travels? Other GPS will give the locations but none have ratings, hours of operation, and further descriptions of the accomodation. And if you're a AAA member you can save on some attractions; I know I've missed on a few discounts by my own ignorance. This is a real feature worth considering if you decide to use this during travels outside your area.. 

$$;
Pros:. faster interface than 700 series. 
Cons:. voice quality. 
Summary:. I bought the 4050 when it first came out and was disappointed. I had a 760 and was looking for an upgrade. I always hated searching the POI's and gambling on the quality of the restaurant. I fell for the AAA tourbook, traffic kit and the voice recognition features in making my choice. Blue tooth doesnt matter to me and shouldnt for you either. If your phone has bluetooth it probably also has a speakerphone option and none of these units sound any better than your speaker phone (buy an earpiece).. The voice recognition isnt worth the difference from the 4040 to the 4050. Its benefits are minimal and the quality is horrible. I'm from CT with a minimal northeastern accent. This thing couldnt understand me. Furthermore, it would activate in the middle of conversations you may be having with your passengers. I turned it off arter 2 days. The AAA feature is sub-par, their arent that many entries from the AAA book as you would hope and they're seperate from the Magellan POI library.. I also feel that the voice quality is just ok. The 4050 sounds very mechanical while the 4040 sounds a bit better. I also dont like that the directions have a different voice than when it gives you street names.. I wound up keeping the 4040 and ordering the traffic kit. Unfortunately the traffic kit doesnt fit. 

$$;
Pros:. Good response time. Easy to read.. 
Cons:. I would prefer to be able to have a choice of voices.. 
Summary:. Used it on our first trip to San Diego, Ca. Without it, we would have had a lot of wasted time looking at maps from mapquest.. After having read the reviews I choose the Magellan 4040 because I felt it was the best for the money, especially the 10% AAA discount. Plus I got to look at one up close at the AAA care center.. One of the reviewers claimed that there was no ETA available. Not True. Also, the unit told me what side of the road my destination was on everytime.. I thought it was an excellent choice on my part.. 

$$;
Pros:. works fine all the time. 
Cons:. minimal not even a problem. 
Summary:. I have the 300T before and this is far out even compare to the competing product for the value and quality is solid. No nonsense mp3 or picture capabality never experience the lock up or slow processing. The POI is everything that you will need tap the screen and will show you what want.. The telephone was easy in pairing and the best when talking and driving at same time, nothing to hold you just tap the screen to answer. Magellan 4040 you hit a homerun.. 

$$;
Pros:. Reception, voice, AAA guidebook, POIs. 
Cons:. POIs when routing, trip routing. 
Summary:. I have used several gps units including handheld and mounted units. I really like this unit, and if there were a few things different, it could be even better.. I really like:. &gt;The size and layout of the screen. &gt;The speed in crerating (calculating) a route. &gt;The number of POIs on the unit. &gt;The AAA tourbook information included. &gt;The "current info" screen. &gt;The looks of the mapping screen and the split screen when approaching a turn. &gt;The exit POI info given when on the hwy. I don't like so much:. &gt;That you must end routing to go search for POIs (other than exit POIs). &gt;That you can't search for POIs by entering the name directly (the search function works well, but you must search by category and location and then flip through a list, as opposed to typing in the name such as "outback"). &gt;The battery only is 2-3 hrs. &gt;The menu screens are fine, but could be a little more condensed into one screen. Overall, I really like this unit. I have used predominately Garmin units before now. The satellite reception this unit has is incredible. I assume this is due to the newer Sirf system, and it may be the same for other units, but on a 2,000 mile trip last week, I NEVER lost the signal (except in a long tunnel). I used to have to put my gps on the dash to keep the signal, but I kept this on my console and it worked great, also got signal clearly in my office at home, approximately 10' from any windows.. I am a AAA member and I like the AAA tourbook info included. Also the warranty extension (2 years) is nice as is the info included on AAA discounts.. I didn't like the fact that I had to "end" the routing temporarily to look for POIs. For example, 60 miles from a town, I want to look for a particular restaurant - I have to stop the routing to go look for the restaurant, find it, then recalculate the route. Also, when setting a multiple location trip, say 5 cities, each is it's own route, and the unit won't "string" them together the way my Garmin did. I would hope some of these tyhings could be changed with firmware upgrades. I have already noticed that some of the things others mentioned in previous reviews have been changed and improved in the current update such as the auto off option and the ETA displaying when enroute.. I believe that anyone would be happy with this gps that has not already gotten used to another type. If a few changes are made in the functionality, I can't see how anyone would not like it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright, sharp screen, outstanding SIRFStar III satellite acquisition,"smart" address entry, loud clear speaker, easy Bluetooth integration. 
Cons:. A bit heavy, route recalculation is a little slow, screen difficult to see in direct sunlight, on-screen volume control (no buttons). 
Summary:. Overall a very well rounded Nav system, especially considering the features you get for the price. The screen is surprisingly bright and crisp. Satellite acquisition was fast and accurate (even worked in an underground parking garage!) I really wanted a larger screen nav system with text-to-speech street name announcement and this fit the bill. I bought mine at Costco for $399 - what a deal!. 

$$;
Pros:. Large screen, AAA points of interest, Intuitive to use, No gimmicks like MP3, digital radio, language converters, etc. 
Cons:. Bluetooth capability (it's a GPS! not a phone). External antenna requires an expensive add on cradle.. 
Summary:. This is my first ever GPS and the reason I bought it is because I get lost in strange cities and confused in my own (even using a map.) All I want is assistance in getting around.. Testing it in my familiar home area, I found that it is right all of the time, but doesn't know the short cuts that I do. Can't expect that much from a machine.. My map still sits beside me as a backup and I would recommend that if you have one. The GPS is an aid, not a replacement to common sense and a good map. Without a map, as in an unfamiliar city, just add more common sense.. The Maestro 4040 was chosen because it is large screen and basic. I mount it on the windshield, but would prefer to have it closer and am put off that Magellan does not have a place to plug in their external antenna without buying a very expensive Traffic Mount. I don't want their traffic reporting capability because I live in Canada and that service is not available here. I don't even want to subscribe to that service in the US even though I travel there often. Just not interested.. I found that the GPS gets confused on special street situations such as when two streets just join by merging into one without proper intersections and the last hundred feet or so takes one of the street names. By paying a little attention to the map I can usually figure out what happened and what I should do.. More confusing is when the two streets immediately go onto the one that you need to make a turn on. Again, paying attention to the display helps sort this out.. City planners and politicians, being the prima donnas they are (only in Canada of course), like to break up streets for reasons known only to themselves. The GPS cannot recognise streets blocked off by residential demands to stop others driving through, or for bicycles only, etc.. Got an unknown block number on the GPS once and found out, by driving around, that a very short street had been cut up into three shorter streets, blocked off from each other, and the house block 100 numbers were split within each of the shorter blocks. My brand new printed map showed them as a continuous street, not split up.. I have never had a problem in an area with a grid system of streets unless it has been tampered with by city planners.. It also gets confusing to me and the GPS on a winding road that encoounters 3 or 4 other streets that butt onto the end of it. Although the GPS does tell me what street to turn onto I usually find that my city folks don't put up proper street signs (if any) so it's a crap shoot where to turn. Fortunately I'm going slowly at this point and try a guess. So far its been 50-50.. I like that the Maestro 4040 is reasonably priced ($500 Canadian, you figure it out) and is relatively fat free. Complaints I've read about other brands MP3 sound quality, Bluetooth compatibility problems, lack of dictionaries, and so on are of no interest to me. Even the existing Bluetooth capability is, for me, a waste of an icon on the screen. I don't want anything but a GPS.. I noticed an occasion when a main road "T's" with a gentle curve onto another that the GPS failed to recognise it as a proper intersection. Happened only once and I haven't been that route since so can't duplicate that. Next time I'll take a look at the display and see what that shows.. Like the warning screen says, use common sense and don't believe the GPS implicitly. As in when using the "shortest route" the GPS does exactly that, even though if you went one street over, you may be on a main road and get there without trying to cross other main roads from a side street.. I've found "fastest route" generally selects major roads, but not always.. All in all, it has helped me more than poring over a map and then trying to remember all the turns or attempting to look at the map quickly at red lights.. Text to speech is great. Pronuciation is not perfect, but close enough. Street names to turn on are displayed on the screen as well. Turning instructions are given in plenty of time.. My store gave me 15 days to try it out and a no questions cash refund if I am not satisfied for any reason. Can't beat that!. Saw one review where a complaint was made about the quality of the included pouch to put the GPS in.. Mine is great, fits snug, and I make a point to remove the unit and put pouch and all into my pocket when I park. This removes the temptation of someone breaking my window to steal same.. I also enjoy the feature of making up a route containing several stops and letting the GPS figure out how to get there efficiently.. Typing in city names or even full details of regular stops is simplified by accessing previous cities or trips and just selecting them.. The go to an intersection icon is also handy when I don't remember an address or just want to get out of where I am to somewhere familiar.. All in all this GPS does what I hoped it would do and would recommend it.. The only complaint I have is not with the GPS but with the Magellan web site. It doesn't have (or I can't find) a way to contact them so I can ask some questions about their remote antenna connection.. 

$$;
Pros:. excellnet value for money, excellnet POI, mapping is very good.. 
Cons:. little slower recalculation of route. phone book download.. 
Summary:. I read several review and used it for my recent trip. I am seeing several inaccurate review also.. When comparing to similrlay equipped gps from tomtom and garmin, this unit is fares excellent in value for your money.. It has large screen, v. good maps, can get signal even in passenger seat. good bluetooth connectivity, excellnt POI (AAA points are even better). None of the GPS company can keep the map 100% accurate. This map is very good.. Cons: reroute is slow and only get activated when you already cross the point. If the road you are taking exit from and the exit route are close + the next exit is very close then the unit may run into slow recalucation issue. The other issue is that this gps does show a very detail exit route in split screen but there is no way to go back to split sceen once you are close to exit. So be sure to pay attention when you are ~0.2 mile away from exit. (it shows the detail on it's own @ .2miles). The recalualtion may show tell you to take a U turn several time but it's a learning thing with any gps. Overall the recalculation should be little faster. The phone book transfer from phone to gps is manual.. The unit also may need some reset in once in while. Good thing that reset doesn't reset the preious entries.. I wish some of the interface could be better. some the menu should be available in both POI and map mode.. Bottomline: you can spend $ 200 to get some only a little better and some worse features.. 

$$;
Pros:. wide screen, quick response map, number of POIs, zip code entry, ample sound, user friendly menus, easy operation. 
Cons:. software not adjustable, occasional innacuracies, slow to search for POI by name, too many clicks to enter new address into address book,. 
Summary:. I purchased this device at best buy for 449.00, after comparing to the cobra, tomtom, and garmin nuvi 200 &#38; 350, etc. What sold me was the bigger screen which seemed to be the best mix of color and an accurate view. Also the sheer number of POIs.. I considered the Garmin 350 for the battery life, but the screen is smaller, an antennae sticks out, it has no zip entry, no bluetooth, and the magellan has a illustration of your upcoming turn, and the distance to it on the main screen. The Garmin has no turn specific illustration and no mention of the distance to it. The Garmin does have an updated ETA on the main screen, while the Magellan has this information one click away, but I would rather have more information about upcoming turns than ETA constantly displayed. I will note that I have 20-15 vision and some of the text may be too small for some, but I was delighted.. You can look up all the features for any of the devices, so let me just add my observation on the actual operation I saw.. Screen / Mapping. The screen looks great to me, I do like the Garmin style though as well, so this is ceartainly a matter of taste. I read alot of negative talk about the Magellan being u-turn happy, but when I specifically went off course I would only get the u-turn suggestion as appropriate (I am in NJ where most main roads have jug handles, and with one exception in a month of constant use, the Magellan advised me to take the appropriate, safe way to turn, and/or turn back. The device updates in a second or two, and when it actually is quicker it changes from telling you to turn back to telling you to go forward with new route.. Detour-. I will admit I have not used the Detour function but a couple of times, yet I found it very nice. It compares your speed constantly with the speed expected on the road you are travelling. When you are in traffic, it prompts you with a little red detour symbol. One clidk to the detour menu, you enter the ballpark distance of the slowdown, and it immediately routes you around. Very pleased.. POIs-. Many POI's organized by category &#38; subcategory. This is one of the key features, they just need to iron out the kinks. One being the speed of a search by name, can take up to 30 seconds. Another being a category search can leave you missing some POIs. I searched for Lowes under home improvement/ home center/ and none were found. Home Depot, but no lowes? Only after searching home improvement / lumber/ did I find it. This does not apply, of course to a search by name, and really like I say is more of a kink needing to be worked out than a major problem.. Address book-. Easy to enter and maintain with 2 exceptions. You cannot enter your home address by locking your current location, you must actually enter an address, so if the internal map is off a hundred feet or so, (as would be expected with however many billions of addresses, locations, etc) you can't correct the home location. Also to enter a new address into the address book you must hit at least 4 touches on the screen to get into the correct entry menu. And there absolutely should be an escape or quit key that allows you to exit from any place to the main menu in one click, because you are forced to hit back or cancel to get out as far as you got in. This brings me to my last point.. Software-. These are little computers, slower versions of the future computers we will all be carrying around with us. They have nearly INFINITE updateability and adjustability! I would expect that all the GPS manufacturers would be making the ownership of their product a gateway to a special community / family, where input is requested and rewarded, and where updates are given and suggestions are implemented. The GPS is running software after all. I have visited Garmin's website as well as Magellan's and I get not sense of community. They simply want you to register, and only complain if the device fails, or you are too stupid to figure out how to use it. I don't understand this. If Magellan took and active role in getting inputs and implementing them, they could have Garmin by the suction cups, but instead they just seemingly update the software at the same rate as any other "dumb" device.. My main suggestion would be making the interface adjustable. The user can decide how the screen looks, colors, which pieces of information on the main screen, etc. When I upgrade to a new unit, that is the feature I will be looking for. Even if I would have to adjust these conditions in a windows program and then load like an update onto the device, it would be far better.. Conclusion-. A solid device. Like I say, my first GPS. I am a solid gadget guy who waited too long to get a GPS, but this thing really changes how I drive. Now I just drive and worry about the scenery, not staying on the beaten path, or the "google map printout." I would recommend this device for the reasons I mention, but ABSOLUTELY this like most things electronic is opinion based. I shopped around for a couple solid days, touching, researching, asking questions, etc. I just really liked the overal product of the 4040 better than the others out there, and I still do.. Good luck. 

$$;
Pros:. Screen Size, Bluetooth, Text-to-Speech, AAA Points of Intrest. 
Cons:. Phone contacts can't be transferred, no auto connect function for the bluetooth. 
Summary:. After doing much research into buying a GPS unit I settled on the Maestro 4040....And I'm not sorry....If your in the market for a Good Basic GPS ( when I say basic I mean NO picture viewer, media player or all the other things a GPS unit does not need to be a GPS)then this is a good unit for you.I've had this unit for Two week's now and have used it to travel to Ct. from N.H.and all over N.H. and Ma. and It works perfectly. 

$$;
Pros:. attractive design, good navigation, AAA Tourbook. 
Cons:. no auto connect for bluetooth phone, no auto volume. 
Summary:. In the past I owned both a TomTom Go 300 and TomTom One. I sold my 300 and purchased the One because I needed a slimmer GPS for my vehicle. However, I quickly returned the One as I was unable read the screen on sunny days. I purchased the 4040 because of the AAA Tourbook, use of Navteg Maps (vs. TeleAtlas on TomTom), and brighter screen. I have not been disappointed. Directions seem to be accurate, however I note that the POI database may be a little outdated. I can acutally read the screen when using during daylight. The 4040 is very easy to use as well. As I am a AAA member I love the included tourbook. Also unlike the TomTom POIs are more detailed, for example TomTOm allows you to search for restaurants whereas the 4040 allows you search by cusisine type such as Italian, Mexican, and so on. The vehicle mount also holds in place much better than either TomTom mount and the 4040 is easier to attach to the mount than either of the TomToms were. My only quibbles are that your bluetooth enabled cell phone will not automatically connect to the 4040, no automatic volume feature like on the TomTom, and that the touchscreen can be a little finicky sometimes. Otherwise, I think this a solid device with good features, the most important being I can acutally read the screen during daytime use in sunlight.. 

$$;
Pros:. Flexible, functional, small. 
Cons:. Slow to start. 
Summary:. While this GPS can take several minutes to find its initial position, it otherwise is an excellent substitute for an installed GPS system (especially those for American or European cars, which totally suck!).. The bluetooth connection is worthless - you have to shout your party to be heard, and even then you sound like you're in a well.. While the voice-activated commands are pretty good, again, you have to shout, and say things in exactly the right way (and sometimes it responds to you when you're not talking to it!). They should have programmed a command to return to the map after you've cancelled a route - instead, the maestro remains on the menu page - pretty dumb.. But all in all, this is a very good product.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very accurate, Slimmer than previous versions. 
Cons:. It is a strip down version of the previous versions!. 
Summary:. I have to say first of all, that Magellan has the best software out of all the other GPS units that I have owned. I specially like the programmable icons on the screen. the POI selection has been updated, and is very accurate in my area So. CA. The unit is much thinner than the previous 6000T version. It now takes SD card, for backup memory. I also love the new windshield mount, it is much better than the previous versions. However, it lacks a lot of the bells &#38; whistles of the previous versions. For example, you don't have choice of map colors anymore. Only night &#38; day time vision. The voice selection is gone, now it's only a female's voice. The bluetooth works much better than before. One big draw back of the Magellan over Garmin is the traffic alert. The Garmin's traffic alert system, is much more accurate, and nicer set up than Magellan's. Overall it's still a very nice unit. I just wish that Magellan kept some of the bells and whistles on this unit. I really don't care for the AAA stuff.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good routing; very detailed and current maps; POI entries are pretty useful, but not really up-to-date; good handsfree phone system.. 
Cons:. Several erroneous entries on the map; phone contacts cannot be transferred to the phone.. 
Summary:. This was the first GPS I bought (have used ones on rental cars before) simply to get the utility of a bluetooth handsfree set. Over the last 3 weeks, I have found this to be relatively useful. The major issues that one should consider before this are:. 1) Bluetooth handsfree set: The fact that one needs to pick up the phone and find the number one needs to dial, defeats the purpose of a handsfree set. The address list allows you to enter the phone numbers, however, the 400+ contacts could not be easily transferred to my GPS. Still trying to find out (BTW Magellan's POI editor bombs on my Windows Vista PC).. 2) Use of a primeval USB 1.0 interface: These days where a $20 USB pocket drive can support a USB 2.0 interface, I wonder how much Magellan gained by leaving this out. Otherwise this is a good buy for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, bluetooth w/Razr phone. 
Cons:. Bluetooth does not disconect when unit shuts off. 
Summary:. This is my 2nd Magellan GPS. I also have a 3100 that still works well, but wanted the larger screen and more POI for our primary car. The only downside is that the unit does not recognize that when I turn it off that it should disable the Bluetooth connection. My phone disconnects with no problem, but when you turn the GPS back on, the GPS still thinks it's connected. If you go into the blue tooth settings, you can not disconnect after this happens and have to do a reset. Once done unit works fine again with BT. If it was not for this, I would rate the unit an 8.. 

$$;
Pros:. Still better than Tom Tom (not going with NAVTEQ really shows), Touch Screen, Reliable - Lots of satellites/good signal. 
Cons:. Slow Re-routing, slow to process through menus/features, Nighttime view is still too bright, Phone conversations via Bluetooth are not loud enough at full volume/digitized TTS is 2x louder at half vol. 
Summary:. My family has 4 cars, 3 with navi (Honda, Acura, BMW - all recently purchased within the past 3 years) and unfortunately, mine without. Feeling left out, I bought the Maestro 4040 because it was on sale.. It is not as bad as many other reviewers claim it is for the price. I would say it is comparable to other stock in-dash systems. I've even had the opportunity to use the Mercedes Benz system in my friend's new SUV. Map routing-wise, the Mercedes is equivalent to a Tom Tom, meaning any recent Magellan is better at taking you where you need to go.. Stuff that is supposed to be selling points:. Text-to-Speech - nice to have, but not necessary, especially when streets have uncommon/hard to pronounce names. The mispronunciation of "Airport" is probably the most disappointing, especially for such a commonly used term.. Nighttime View - it reverses the colors for only the roads, everything else is in daytime colors, meaning it doesn't really help much/if at all.. The signal is great, I haven't lost a connection once.. Bluetooth Sync - I've read a lot of problems with syncing mobile phones with the Maestro. I think most people don't realize that some American mobile phone services limit a lot of the Bluetooth functionality in their phones (so people can't connect to devices such as computers and would have to buy ringtones from them). I have a overseas phone that isn't even sold in the US, and it had no problem connecting to the Maestro. If your phone can sync to a computer and transfer files, I'm pretty sure you can connect to the Maestro, if not, I think you have a 50/50 chance.. Even if you can get it to sync, you're not missing out on much. The calling function on the phone isn't all that great. Even at full volume, the speaker isn't even as loud as the Map mode at half volume, you might as well hold the thing up to your ear, but then that would not exactly be hands-free anymore, would it?. If you really, really think about it. You're getting exactly what you paid for, especially when there are systems which cost 3-4x's more. For a person who has experience with only dealer-option car navigation and one disappointing Tom Tom, I would say it is a good value.. If you want something that will Wow you - pay more for something else. If you just need something to help you from A to B, you should be fine with this.. 

$$;
Pros:. Clear TTS, good routing. 
Cons:. Poor touch screen accuracy. 
Summary:. I have a new 4040. I too have had or used several other GPS units. The overall value is OK, but not wonderful. My complaints so far are 1) the text is too small, 2) tapping on a letter or screen icon requires a lot of force, and often results in an error, such as the wrong letter. 3) A battery indicator showing how much battery charge is left is on a sub screen, rather than the main screen. I ran the unit on battery for about an hour, when the battery became low, the unit displayed a quick warning to plug in the charger, and then immediately died. 4) There is a glitch in the zoom function-the unit arbitrarily will change the zoom level for about a minute-and during that time, the unit is zoomed so far out that you can not see any details on the map, so the unit is useless for about a minute. Related to this, the heading method changes from heading up to heading north. In other words, the map and heading goes wacku for about a minute and then fixes itself - but it's distracting. And the bluetooth phone quality is horrible. There is so much background noise that it's not useful. You could not use this bluetooth to talk to a client or other important call. I had much better bluetooth on a Garmin C550. My biggest complaint is that the screen font is very small. On the top line, where the current street is shown, and the bottom line, where the name of the next turn is shown, the letters are small and very hard to read. It would have been easy to make those areas larger and easier to read. When I first used a GPS, it was in a Ford rental, and I loved the basic functionality and overall quality. This device has a lot of features, but it somehow misses being a quality product on several points. I think the Garmin's are better, and they cost more. I guess you get what you pay for. I'm considering paying the up charge for a Garmin 660.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets me to destination. 
Cons:. Outdated map data, no town/city names, slow CPU. 
Summary:. I bought the 4040 with apprehension and because it was available and Garmin was not. In my previous experience with a handheld GPS, I sold my Magellan and bought a Garmin and it turned out to be much better. I will return the Magellan for a refund ASAP and will get a Garmin.. I just finished 3000 miles from Alaska to Oregon. While the unit helped get me there, it showed the following flaws:. 1. Routed me over a bridge closed for 3 years.. 2. When I am on a route (not a freeway), POI's aren't available. If I ask for "Exit POI's, none available is returned. I have to cancel the route to access POI's. A real bad feature!!!!. 3. When zooming in and out, selected point in the circle after panning does not stay anchored and moves.. 4. Panning with finger is very jerky and movement is unpredictable.. 5. City/Town names are not displayed. That requires me to have a paper map to know what town is ahead.. 6. I bought my unit on September 24 2007. After updating firmware to 2.24 I have map data current as of June of 2006. That is totally bad.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent screen, looks, loud. 
Cons:. Slow/Unusable, Bluetooth problems, Outdated Maps, Poor Software, Not very customizable. 
Summary:. Got this as an "upgrade" to my TomTom 710. Had it for a week and there's a lot of problems with this.. Main problem - it's SLOW! Windows CE based, I guess. It takes 30s+ sometimes to re-route, and it hides the map while it's doing it. You get lost in small residential streets. POI search takes almost a minute to complete! THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.. This GPS is easy to use, but you can't customize as much as a TomTom. Also, Magallan didn't provide any Software (beside Custom POI importer which I actually did get to work).. Bluetooth hands free feature is actually pretty good. Voice quality was acceptable. BUT, it drops connection with my LG 500 every 5 mins or so. Very annoying, doesn't reconnect on it's own. Hence, Hands free calling DOES NOT WORK! I searched online and I'm not alone - this is common issue. Doubt Magellan will fix this anytime soon.. Also, this mount is awful. Bulky - looks like a monster in place of my old TomTom.. Returning back to Cosco shortly..

Pros:. Big screen.. 
Cons:. Pain in the butt menus.. 
Summary:. I took a Garmin Nuvi, Sony U83T and my Magellan Maestro 4040 out to see which one was better. The Sony drove me around in circles for 20 minutes, the Magellan tried to get me to drive thru a forest to get to the house on the other side. The only one that got me there was the Garmin. Evertime I came to a corner the magellan would tell me to turn right and the Sony told me to turn left. The Garmin told me to go straight and I went right to the house I was looking for. Had I listened to the others I would have gone well out of my way to get where I was going. The Garmin Nuvi is the easiest and pretty much the most accurate out there.. 

$$;
Pros:. Wide screen, Bluetooth dialing. 
Cons:. Old maps and POI files with defined time for next updates. 
Summary:. I was trying to get the best product. Bought this GPS. Here is some things i found about it-. Maps are very old. Points of interest are old. Most of them have either changed phone numbers are out of business. Not reliable when you need to find a place/POI when in hurry. I was running low on gas and looked for nearest gas station in GPS POI. I drove to the place to find the gas station shut down since Jan 2007. Spent hours on phone with AAA and Magellan to get an updated POI, they just keep sending me to one other for it. I am now looking in to buying a Garmin which updates the maps regularly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use and setup take 5 mins. 
Cons:. In accurate and slow. 
Summary:. Bought and now getting ready to return. 4040 is a sleek and has some good features that are typical in high end models but it lacks basics such as accurate positioning and directions. It is slow in acquiring signal and it takes forever to download firmware updates from Magellan support site.. 

$$;
Pros:. user friendly. 
Cons:. blue tooth mapping. 
Summary:. this is a very poor gps. my tomtom and garmon are so much better. 

$$;
Pros:. Large Screen, Blue Tooth Feature. 
Cons:. GPS had issues. 
Summary:. I am a first Time Car GPS buyer and bought the Magellan 4040 because it had decent reviews and some extra features such as the AAA Guidebok. The unit comes with a lot of extras like the mount which needs some assembling, wall charger, car charger, USB cable and SW Package. The instruction said to charge the unit 3 Hours before 1st use which I did. I also managed to enter my home address and add a couple of entries to the address book. The GPS managed to get a strong reception even inside my house. So far so good. But then I tried it in the car drining in the SF Sout Bay area. The GPS lost the signal somwhere on Higway 101 and there I was without voice guidance. I could use the turn by turn list but the GPS never received th signal again. I managed to find a tooth pick and reset the 4040 but didn't have any luck getting it back to work. i went home registered with Magellan, Downloaded and installed the firmware update (which required an empty at least 16MB SD card) and tried it again. Still the unit wouldn't work. Called their support who guided me through the steps to manually set the current GPS position (Is that really necessary for a GPS?). Then I was told to go somewhere where the GPS has an unobstructed view of the Sky, and leave it there for 20 minutes (that long for getting a signal?). Did that and it didn't work the first time. Tried it again and it worked. No I was hoping that was the last issue with it. So I took it on another drive, and after a couple of miles same thing: Lost the signal and reset would accomplish anything. My conclusion had enough trouble with it and I returned it. Since I needed something urgently went and bought a Garmin Steet Pilot s330 and I was AMAZED how simple it was compared to the Magellan. Unpack stick it on the already assembled Multi-position mount, connect to the Car outlet turn on, select the language and enter destination. Works instantly like charm.. 

$$;
Pros:. Works well in the country. 
Cons:. Doesn't work well in a big city. 
Summary:. I thought this worked well in my area, but I know my town well as their isn't a need for it here.. I tried using it in Chicago, IL and talk about a nightmare. It had the streets all wrong. I'd turn and it would not recognize I turned. I kept having to reset it. It would be okay until I made a turn. It told me the POI (Points of Intrest) was not available for that area! If you don't have POI for a city like Chicago, what is the point!!!. I also used it in Indianapolis, it did have the streets right... but NO POI in Indy either. It did give me POI for little towns like Plymouth, Indiana!!. All in all I did not find this reliable enough to through away my maps... OR even to take a trip without maps. This just did not live up to the hype for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use products, good technology. 
Cons:. Horrible, time consuming customer service, slow to acquire GPS signal. 
Summary:. Although I have not tried the Maestro, I did pay $700 plus tax for their previous Roadmate GPS model. I tried to additional purchase accessories via their website, and it was a disaster their product descriptions are misleading, their website is not user-friendly, and it was a frustrating experience.. So I decided to call them and place my order - bad mistake. They hide their US phone numbers, and you usually get switched to their Indian call center, not matter which number you call. The call center people are nice and polite, but not very helpful. The company duplicated my order, and returning the duplicate order was a painful (and costly) experience, requiring several phone calls and a lot of wasted time.. Although I generally like my GPS unit, I will never buy another Magellan product again. Apparently they do not realize that customers that pay high prices for their products deserve good service..

Pros:. Large screen, easy to read. 
Cons:. Bluetooth impossible to set. Needs cell phone voice dialing to keep attention on driving..

Cons:. no customer loyalty or support. 
Summary:. My name is Tony Essery, I have until very recently been a loyal Magellan customer having purchase 5 GPS units from your company. In April I purchased a Explorist 400 for my birthday and intended to use it in July on a trip to Southern Mexico. Well the product never worked, I tried to return it to sears but it had already been 30 days since purchase so they would not exchange it. I then contacted your support group whom gave me a return authorization # and address to send the unit to. The tech on the phone said this was a common defect and this would be a quick turnaround. I mailed it to your Texas repair facility Via USPS with delivery confirmation (you received the Item on August 3) I waited almost 3 weeks for the item and then called for a status. The tech said there was a software problem at there end and could not verify any information for me. The tech also informed me they would call me before the end of the day. The next day I still had not received any call, so I called back. Now the tech informed me that they were very sorry and my gps would be sent out immediately, I should expect it in 3-4 days. 1 Week later still no GPS, I called back and asked for a supervisor (Rita, they would not tell me last names) whom apologized and said in fact there were no 400 models available to ship (so they never shipped or called) so I asked for the next level of upgrade since I basically had a brand new unit that never worked. Rita agreed and said she would be sending a NEW 600 explorist out immediately, expect this in 1 week. 1 Week and 2 days later still no GPS. So I called back This time I asked for the head of the dept. I spoke with Tanlee (again no last name) He informed me the item still had not shipped (gave me no reason) but he was shipping the I tem out immediately and I would receive it in 1 week. I explained that I would need proof as this has already been promised to me, he said he could provide no proof due to soft ware issues on their side. One week later I still had no GPS and very angrily called back and spoke with supervisor Sam Daniel, whom again promised me the unit to be shipped in 1 week. Now I called back and spoke to Supervisor Wilson whom only could repeat every promise made earlier to me and swore I would definitely receive my gps in 1week. Guess what, it has been 1 week and 2 days and I still do not have my GPS. By the way every single person I spoke with was from India so I could hardly understand them and they could often not communicate with me, Can you even imagine how upset I now am? I have tried to call the cooperate HQ on several occasions and never could get anyone on the phone due to the automated response system. I have never in my life (32 years) been so insulted or had worse customer service. It is now October 12th And I still have not received my unit or any explanation from Magellan. Buyer Beware!. 

$$;
Pros:. It looks really cool. 
Cons:. It doesn't work very well. 
Summary:. Pros:. 1) Looks cool. 2) Exit POIs are great idea (except they are the same at the signs on the road). Cons:. 1) When re-routing, you get a blue screen with an hour glass that takes forever. 2) It's version of re-routing consists of telling you to make the next legal u-turn. 3) The bluetooth phone connection doesn't give you access to your phone's address book. Is it really hands-free calling if I have to pull the phone out of my pocket and dial numbers? And who is going to sit and program 100 phone numbers into the unit, one by one?. 

$$;
Pros:. Lots of features (if they work correctly; which they don't). 
Cons:. Poor routing, poor software design, long recalcs, viewing route list hangs unit up, slow map redraws. 
Summary:. OK....I couldn't wait and bought the 4040 at Circuit City at 10 AM. I returned it at 7 PM. Can you tell I wasn't impressed?. I will give you my opinion and I'll be interested to see what Fletch has to say in his upcoming, in depth review.. I'll start with the good. Let me preface this by saying I'm from NY and recently my job took me to CT, where I currently live. I do a lot of traveling for work, especially on the east coast, and am always in NY to visit friends and family. I know the NY streets like the back of my hand, since I was born there and lived there for just about my entire life.. Pros:. - Good screen; visible in all kind of lighting. The little sun that hit it directly didn't affect its readability.. - Seems to be jam-packed with routing featrure, i.e. detour by road. How well they work is another story and I'll explain this in more detail in the "cons.". - Routing engine seems, well, OK. Just OK. It took some of the same routes as my 2720, but took some really odd ones, especially in NY. I'll explain later. Both units use NavTeq maps, so the choices of routes probably come primarily from the routing engines. However, the NavTeq maps on the Maestro seem more outdated than my Garmin, which is running under Navigator 8. Navigator 8, with its NavTeq maps, is out about a year now, so shame on Magellan if this is the case.. - Good, loud speakers. Very impressive.. - "Exit POI's" While traveling on the highway, this will take you to POI's in the direction you are traveling, and not behind you.. - AAA guide. Very useful if you're a AAA member like me.. Cons:. - Slow map redraws. The Windows hour glass would pop up now and then and this frustrated me, much as one would be frustrated by the hour glass on a slow computer. My Garmin redraws instantaneously, so flawlessly that you cannot even tell.. - When switching to the list view, to examine the route, the hour glass literally hangs the unit for a minute or more. You cannot even scroll past certain roads till the unit catches up to the text. That's how awful and unacceptable it is.. - You cannot set "Home" to your current location. You must input an address. Seems like it's no big deal until you realize that some people live in condos or complexes, and the physical address of their unit either doesn't exist or doesn't take them to their door.. - The unit is bulky. Not as streamlined as the Garmin. This is not something you'd feel comfortable with carrying in your pocket throughout the day, especially in the summertime when your pockets are already filled with your wallet and cell.. - U-turns. Friggin U-Turns. There is NO option to turn this off. If you miss a turn, you will travel endlessly as the unit keeps trying to roue you the opposite way via a u-turn. I was on 372 (in Cromwell CT) and the Silas Deane Hwy in Rocky Hill CT. I intentionally missed my turn and for what seemed like miles, the unit insisted I make a U-Turn. You do NOT make a U-turn on either road, unless you're begging for a ticket from the cops who hide in the strip malls waiting to nail you.. Same thing happened on major roads in NY where only a psychopath would take a U-turn.. - When starting out on a route, the Maestro rarely tells you to take the highlighted route, as the Garmin units do. You have to drive some for the TTS to kick in. Not such a big deal I suppose, but you're sitting there confused for a bit, wondering in which direction to travel.. - TTS. (Text to Speech). Extremely robotic and not as conversational and natural as Garmin's. Garmin units will say, "In 500 feet, make a left turn onto Broadway." The Maestro goes something like this: " In 500 feet make a left turn"....pause......"Broadway." The Maestro TTS certainly isn't pleasing to the ears and the phrasing is unnatural as you can see from my example.. - POI - I didn't test the accuracy of many POIs, but one thing about the Maestro POI was annoying. When the list for a category would appear, it would not tell you the direction of each POI, like the Garmin does. You'd have to select it and route to it to find out where the heck it was. However, there is a useful "exit POI" function that would take you to the POI toward your exit on the highway, and not behind the direction you are traveling.. -Detour function. What should have been a HUGE plus is actually a huge disappointment. The Maestro wanted to take me on a strange route to Brooklyn, NY (more on that later). After waiting for the hourglass to disappear (tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, snore) to examine how the unit wanted to route me, I disvovered some really shady, unexplainable raods it wanted to route me on. So, I selected the first road, chose "exclude" waited for the recalculation and expected to be a happy camper.. I then examined this new route. Back to "list." Back to more hourglass. I noticed that the road was not excluded. ***? I tried it again. More waiting. Still there (the raod I wanted to exclude) but I noticed that the unit changed the way it wanted to take me to this road. It didn't exclude the road, only how to get to that excluded road.. So I pulled over and played with these "detours" and raods I wanted to exclude for a good 20 minutes, each time unsucessfully, trying to trick the unit into taking the road my preferred way. FINALLY I discovered that I shouldn't exclude the road I didn't want to travel. but the EXIT that road takes you to. How effin dumb is that? The Magellan engineers need to go back to grade school.. What makes matters worse is that you can only exclude one road at a time, so it's hit or miss and you have to keep going back to the drawing board to finally extinguish that road. The Garmin 2720 nails this one beautifully. Garmin gets it right!. - Routing engine. Going from CT to NY. Not exactly the sticks, so you'd think that a decent unit, especially one for 500 bucks should get it right.. Instead, not only where the choice of roads questionable, but, no matter my pref - fastest, use of highway, etc,. the Maestro wanted to take me off the highway, WAY before my destination and though the streets in a shady neighborhood with a traffic light on just about every block. My destination was in the Bay Ridge NY area (for those familiar with NY...and CT. I know fletc is) . The Maestro wanted to put me on the Jackie Robinson Hwy and exit to the streets of East NY (bad area) to Kings Highway (which truly isn't a highway - there are lights at every corner or so). Only a tourist, who just got off a plane and is visiting NY for the first time, who can't speak English and has an IQ of 52 would go this way.. - Limited routing prefs. Fastest or shortest time etc. No combination or options like more use of highway, less use of highway, etc. You are stuck with one choice. Lame. Phone GPS's offer more and cost a hell of a lot less.. Conclusion: The Maestro looks AWESOME on paper, but is terribly disappointing in real life usage. I was truly hoping that Magellan would get this one right, but they have a long way to go to compete with Garmin...or even Tom Tom. I'd have to give the Maestro a failing grade.. I wanted a compact unit to go with my bulky Garmin 2720 and 2730, plus GPS technology has become a bit of a passion and hobby. What I wound up doing was returning the Maestro and bought a Garmin nuvi 350 for my wife. The software of the nuvi doesn't compare to the 2720 (less routing options), but playing with and driving around with it for a couple of hours, it seems like a Picasso compared to the Magellan Maestro. The nuvi is quick, map redraws are instant and not noticeable, and the routing is SO much better than the Maestro, at least in CT and simulated routes throughout the northeast.. 

$$;
Pros:. I find very little to like about it.. 
Cons:. GPS was just out of extended service when it broke. Magellan won't touch it. They said I could buy another at a discounted price. Why buy another Magellan product when they won't back what they already sold me?. 
Summary:. As to how it worked: It would take a GOOD 10 MIN OR MORE after starting it up to give me direction. When you are out at night in a city you don't know sitting in a parking lot, the only car left, it is very uncomfortable to be in that position because your GPS won't get going. This was a problem from the get go. There were also wrong directions and missing roads. It finally stopped working at exactly two years after buying it new. It might have been a simple problem (I couldn't get it to turn on),but I will never know because of Magellan's insistence that it no longer makes the parts or repairs such an old model. If I pay $400 approx. for a GPS and use it only once a week on average for 2 years think how much it cost me per use I found the sound to be too low. It was very hard to get it to tell me about alternate routes, and most of the time it wouldn't let me go anywhere but the highway.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice design, liked how it worked.... no issues for 2 years.. 
Cons:. Not mac friendly- can't update with a Macintosh computer.. 
Summary:. I have had this unit for 2 years and ha had to go out and buy a new unit. Both Tom Tom and Garmin update with Macs or PC''s. Why can't Magellan.. 

$$;
Pros:. Bright Screen. 
Cons:. Just about everything. 
Summary:. This piece of garbage was the biggest waste of money I've ever spent. I returned it after four days. I was driving home from Giants Stadium in NJ to my house in westchester, NY and this piece of crap shut off and rebooted four times. I was driving over the GW bridge and once I was over it, it didnt say which exit to get off of until I drove past the right exit. It also had the voice say different distances than what was on the the screen. I bought the Garmin Nuvi 650 for the same price and it has been flawless. DO NOT waste your money on this piece of crap that Magellan makes.. 

$$;
Pros:. When it works, It works OK.. 
Cons:. Can't find the signal, or once it does keeps droping it.... 
Summary:. I gave it a full month, giving it a benefit of a doubt, perhaps it was me not the unit. It wasnt, that wouldve been an easy fix just by worming up the chair a little and learn about the unit a little more. I did that, learned every little nuance about it and it still was frustrating to use it. My beef wasnt so much w/the sound, software or the design as some of the previous reviewers, I was OK w/it. When it worked, it worked fine I didnt have much complaints. The issue was that the unit sometimes took 20-25 min to find a signal even after I would set the GPS status. Once finally found it, often times would loose it for extended periods of times. I wasnt about to set the status every time I start driving. The technical support wasnt much help, they kept reading the same script over and over regardless of what my question was, and reassuring me that the unit will work fine in the future&. Well it did NOT work fine while on the phone w/them or after!. Overall I lost confidence in using this unit, back to my maps and in search for a different brand. Very disappointed!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice screen. 
Cons:. Magellan does not provide map updates. 
Summary:. I'm very displeased with this unit, Magellan does not bother updating the maps. If you drive through Texas it will often try to send you off the edge of the freeway! Magellan, new roads are built all the time, you need to update your maps to reflect the real world. The 360 has been there for 3 years!!!. I'd try the Tom Tom one for half the price and regular map updates. So disapointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice sleek design, current maps, great POI, AAA. 
Cons:. terrible text to speech, unreadable fonts on map, confuses instead of aiding you while routing, bad u turn function, too many impt options buried. 
Summary:. My Garmin C550 was recently stolen and after doing some reading up I decided to buy the Maestro for a change. What a huge mistake.. Where do I start? Out of the box it looks solid and has a nice sleek design. The interface looks pretty good too though its not as intuitive as the Garmin. The Maestro requires too many finger taps to frill down to menus and options that should be readily available.. The first thing I noticed was how tiny the fonts were on the map screen. Since it is a huge screen this is inexcusable. I have perfect vision and yet I still struggled to read crucial information such as the next turn, what road Im on, and what icons to select. What is also missing on the screen is the ETA. I looked high and low for this option but it doesnt exist. Instead it gives you how many hours and minutes to your destination and you have to calculate the time of arrival in your head. I dont think any nav system excludes ETA except for this one.. The routing is very confusing as well, mostly because of the text to speech voice that speaks too fast, too garbled and too robotic. A nav system is supposed to eliminate confusion when driving. The Maestro just adds to the confusion. Between a voice you cant understand and text you cannot read, the Never Lost will get you lost.. I live a mile south of 6 lane major road. I purposely missed the turn I usually take off of that road to see how quickly Id be rerouted. The next left is only about � mile away and also leads me directly to my home. Instead, the Maestro kept prompting me to make a legal u turn when possible. I missed a host of lefts I could have taken as the Maestro kept asking me to make that u turn. This lasted for 2.7 miles till the maestro finally asked me to take a left  into a Wal-Mart parking lot!. I took a trip from my home in Mass. to D.C. and it was a horrible experience. The routing and voice instructions were so unclear and confusing that I was better off just using MapQuest. At least I could have read MapQuests printed fonts.. The bad is so extensive that I will list them. Im sure Im forgetting some. 1) Quick Type, a good feature that grays out letter that is not needed is only available when keying in an address to route. Why is it unavailable when keying in a Point of Interest?. 2) When switching from map view to menu and vice versa there is often a delay and glitch. The hourglass keeps coming up. The same happens when switching back and forth from map to the step by step maneuvers.. 3) Small fonts on a big screen. You can barely see the fonts especially at night.. 4) The colors at night are too bright even if you turn the brightness level down. Too green, too red, too blinding.. 5) TTS is nearly impossible to understand and the pronunciation is totally off. Aiport becomes A-Row-Poit. New Castle becomes En Why Cast Lee. Turn left in � mile becomes Terlefbin � mile. The womans voice is way too fast and way too unclear. It makes for one confusing rote.. 6) Your destination is not announced as being on the left or right. You have to guess. This can pose a danger.. 7) The Maestro will have you drive for miles asking you to u turn. This is not very helpful when youre in an unfamiliar town, your bearings are lost and you do not know whether to turn left or right. There is no option to turn this off as there was in my Garmin C550, which wouldnt keep insisting I make a u turn even if I had it enabled.. 8) The road exclude doesnt work. The highways I want to exclude keep showing up.. 9) Terrible foam carrying case.. 10) So much more bad, but you get the picture.. The only goods I can think of are. 1) It looks cool. 2) Sturdy hardware. 3) Quick calculations. 4) Excellent, current maps. It shows new developments that my Garmin didnt.. Needless to say, this is going back in a couple of days. Ill go back to Garmin, which is thousands of times better than this, only Ill have to decide which model..

Pros:. - This product comes in a nice box.. 
Cons:. - What comes in that box is a totally useless product. 
Summary:. - Machine takes a long time to activate.. - Addresses in existence for 100+ years not recognized.. - Principal streets in town not acknowledged.. - User documentation is incomprehensible.. - This product could cause an accident with all its flaws and malfunctions.. - Mine, unfortunately, was a gift that is going into the trash bin.. - I'm not even going to give it away.. - DO NOT BUY THIS GPS!. 

$$;
Pros:. I could not find anything good about this so called "GPS".. 
Cons:. Cannot find correct address, guides user to the wrong direction and wrong road.. 
Summary:. 1. I was driving cross country from west coast to east coast. I made a huge mistake by use Magellan Maestro 4050 as my GPS. Every morning when I started traveling, this so called "GPS" guided me to I-90 west for 45 - 80 miles, then cross the highway and back to heading east. The road has no problem, no construction, everything is perfectly normal. Just the so called "GPS" is insane. I had to use "Shortest distance" first, then reroute to "fastest time" after I am on the main highway. If I use the "fastest time" when I started driving, the stupid detour thing is going to happen.. 2. On the same trip, many times this so called "GPS" guided me off the highway and go to local for hours and then back to the same highway. 100% sure it is not because of the road has any problem or anything was happening there.. 3. I have been living in my address for 5 years. Not only this so called "GPS", even the newest model of Magellan in the store could not find my address. It even doesn't have the name of the city which is selling this product.. 4. Whenever I have time and in costco or bestbuy, I always telling the people who are looking at Magellan that don't buy this product. It is driving users nuts.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good price. 
Cons:. Many...Outdated database with $79.95 update price and a rip off tactic. 
Summary:. I would like to say that I recently purchased a Magellan 4040 GPS unit and when I started to use it, I quickly find that the database is obsolete. I emailed Magellan and contacted them by phone to discuss this matter. They tell me since I purchased a refurbished unit that they cannot offer free database update. The cost of the database update on a new refurbished unit is $79.95. What a rip off....don't buy Magellan GPS units. They are only a scam.. 

$$;
Pros:. While it worked, it worked well.. 
Cons:. After only 5 months, the voice stopped working. Worst customer serverce. Since it was a gift, and I didn't have the proof of purchase, they wouldn;t fix it.. 

$$;
Pros:. It was pretty?. 
Cons:. Everything!. 
Summary:. Total piece of JUNK!. Wrong places, wrong directions, Voice feature only worked half the time (at a cost of $99!) Bluetooth was worthless and you couldn't hear unless everything was totally silent. Also constantly flashed that the "text message feature" failed.. Here is my summary.. 1. Voice constantly stuttered, sounded like Max Headroom!. 2. Sound(s) would shut off without reason.. 3. Voice activation would just come on by itself and rarely responded.. 4. Constantly had to reboot unit.. 5. Help desk is in another country and difficult to understand.. 6. Missing major roads in Chicago.. 7. It often got confused at stoplights.. 8. Tech Email Support didn't read what was sent and just sent a "canned" letter.. 

$$;
Pros:. Can use as a speaker for mobile phone. 
Cons:. NO UPDATES!!! LAST UPDATE ON MAG SITE WAS SUPPOSEDLY 2006, BUT POI THAT WERE BUILT IN 2003 ARE NO WHERE TO BE FOUND!!!. 
Summary:. I bought this for my husband for Christmas 2007. He was thrilled until he tried to use it. We went on a trip and input the address and following its directions, we ended up in someones back yard. 25 miles from our destination, which ultimately was not to be found on the so-called gps. I tried to contact Magellan to see when there would be an update, but received no response. I contacted the place of purchase for a refund, but was told emphatically NO! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR YOUR MONEY!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It hasn't completely broken yet. 
Cons:. Everything else.. 
Summary:. Magellan's Maestro series, and the 4040 in particular, promises all sorts of goods. Bluetooth compatibility, 4.5 million points of interest, color screen, battery back-up, an SD/MMC for expansion, additional maps for regions "around the world" and so on and so forth. In truth, it's a budget GPS in an expensive box with functionality bordering on laughable. They don't tell you that if you do pair it with a phone by bluetooth the unit freezes and can no longer produce directions. They don't tell you that the 4.5 million points of interest are soleely for Magellan sponsors and offer limited options to the user, the expansion port is for Magellan's rarely produced but required map and firmware updates only, that the battery back-up has a 15 minute life unless you switch off all sound and reduce screen brightness and resolution to a minimum, and they certainly don't tell you that they have withdrawn all the additional regions of maps the allegedly produced for this unit. The latter point is a major annoyance as Magellan instructed sales agents to use expandability as a major talking up point for this unit. In essence, they lied to shift this piece of rubbish. It's a sham, it's overpriced and anyone looking for any sort of true user friendly functionality should avoid this dreadful product like the plague..
