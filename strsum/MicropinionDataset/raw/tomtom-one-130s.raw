$$;
Pros:. Small, easy to use, love the mount, and got a smoking deal on it.. 
Cons:. None so far. Text to speech "computer voice" is noticeably quieter than prerecorded voices. I could still hear just fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple to use. Map updates via shareware available for map corrections and minor software updates. 
Cons:. Maps are Expensive and if you don't update every year you have to purchase previous updates before the latest are provided.. 
Summary:. It is great for me and I use it along with current paper maps. Former Surveyor and I like maps!. 

$$;
Pros:. Speaks street names. Recalculates fast. Simple, bright display. LOUD speaker. 
Cons:. Touch screen is not the most responsive.. 
Summary:. I don't know what CNET is talking about. They probably got a lemon. The volume is very high. I had my radio cranked up, the windows open on the highway and my husband asked me to turn the Tom Tom volume DOWN because it was so high at 100% volume. I turned it down to about 80% and I was still able to hear it.. I'm just happy this thing does it's job, speaks street names, and I got it at a great price from Target! I don't care about blue tooth, watching videos, audio books or any of that stuff. I have other devices dedicated to those things.. I bought this version because I wanted the text to speak functionality, which works great. It reroutes quickly. I'm so glad I got this because it allows me to pay attention to the road instead of looking at printed directions.. The only con I can see is the touch screen. II have a touch screen phone, so I am used to very responsive touch screens. I found the touch screen on this one to not be the most responsive when entering addresses. I made some mistakes pressing buttons as well, but the predictive text helped with this issue.. 

$$;
Pros:. Superior mounting system, CLEAR LOUD SOUND (Almost Too Loud!), fast GPS acquisition, accurate routing, excellent bright display. 
Cons:. RDS traffic is an extra cost add on, speed compensation for volume makes the sound too loud at higher speeds.. 
Summary:. Excellent value by far the best small screen GPS on the market. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use, graphics are very nice.. Map updates are much less expensive than competitors.. Voice quality is VERY good.. Homer Simpson is an available voice! (Costs $13, though.). Routes are usually efficient and accurate.. Several routing options.. 
Cons:. Nothing is a significant drawback with this unit.. It does sometimes have problems finding the exact destination, but will get you close.. The mount can be tricky, but once the unit is connected to the mount, it's quite solid.. 
Summary:. I picked up a recertified version of this, and I can't believe how nice it is. Granted, it is an entry-level unit, but it does everything a basic unit should do.. TomTom must have upgraded the speaker on these units, as the original review said it was too quiet. Mine doesn't suffer from that and others are saying the same. In fact, I often turn it down to about 60% so it isn't too LOUD. It also has a nice feature that adjusts the volume based on your speed (which can be disabled if you like.). Using a utility called GSAK, I can also use this for geocaching. That's a lot of fun for the whole family. Now, all the geocaches I have loaded show up as points of interest and I can easily update them weekly.. The unit is very customizable. We purchased Homer Simpson's voice, and get quite a few chuckles during our trips. There are literally hundreds of voices available on TomTom's site.. When I initially hooked this up and checked for map updates, there was one and it was over 800MB. Using my fast DSL line, it still took about 2ï¿½ hours to download and install the update. But that's much better than not being able to update at all, and it was free.. TomTom currently has a deal going that a year's worth of map updates costs $40. That's a LOT less than competitors charge right now.. If you are looking for a basic but very capable GPS unit, you would do well to consider this. It's very easy to use, yet has many options that make technically-oriented people happy.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like what I have read in all the reviews I have searched for. So far everything I have read, seems to be a very postive thing.. 
Cons:. So far I have read a few negative reviews about this product. But that is one's opinion. But will let you know if I have any.. 
Summary:. Although I haven't received my Tom Tom yet. From what I have read. I am definitely looking forward to getting my new Tom Tom One 130. And I have found one at a very affordable price in the amount of $69.99. Found it on Amazon.com Maybe I shouldn't be writing a review yet, but I'm very happy and looking forward to having it. And this is my first GPS ever. Thanks for reading.. 

$$;
Pros:. It sounds great, and if you miss a road, it automatically tells you to turn around and/or it reroutes you. Easy to see, easy to understand the directions. Directions are loud and clear!. 
Cons:. Nothing that I can find. I love this product!!!!. 
Summary:. This GPS is easy to operate, its loud and clear and gets me where I need to go. I went out of state last week and I never got lost. I felt more secure and safe with this GPS. I give this a 5 star rating!. 

$$;
Pros:. Great GPS, Some voices are louder than others and it's plenty loud... you can see for your self in the store if you go to prefrences and change the voices. 
Cons:. none, at all. 
Summary:. Great price, Great GPS. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Good directions.. 
Cons:. Inconsistent use of the text to speech... Doesn't always say the next street name.. 
Summary:. Does exactly what a GPS should do. No extras to get in the way. Only problem (minor) I've seen is that it doesn't always say the name of the next street when giving directions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap, text-to-speech, handy integrated mount. 
Cons:. no expansion slot, no bluetooth. 
Summary:. I don't know what planet the C|NET reviewer was on, dissing the speaker volume. The unit will vary the volume according to vehicle speed by default. At 85MPH it'll blow you out of your seat! If you're half deaf, disable that feature and I guarantee that you won't have any problems hearing the directions from the enormous speaker on the back of this thing.. This was an impulse buy because I had to drive to a unfamiliar client location for an emergency service call. Best buy didn't have the NUVI I wanted in stock, so I grabbed this one because it was on sale for $199. It certainly got me where I had to go, and I was impressed with the features for the money. After hooking the GPS up to my laptop after the trip, I was further impressed with the automatic updates and the PC control application (TomTom HOME) that seems pretty comprehensive. User updated maps, custom POI and a simple "send to GPS" interface from google maps...even an option for a traffic info adapter. I think this was a pretty good buy. The only drawback I can find right out of the box is the lack of map data for central and south America, places I have to visit for business. Also, it seems like the distance calculations displayed for the POI locations tend to be off by a couple of miles (but it's all relative).. 

$$;
Pros:. Very affordable solution for features provided. Works quickly, has intuitive interface making it easy for anyone to find their way around. Great GPS satellite reception. Connects to computer for updates/upgrades/feature add-ons.. 
Cons:. There is no doubt the screen is a tad small, but it is clear and contrast is fantastic. To get a larger screen you have to go up a model and pay up to $150+, so it's a compromise. Money vs screen size.. 
Summary:. Excellent value entry level GPS navigation device. If you want bluetooth or larger screen look elsewhere, but in the value segment this is one serious contender.. Updated. on Jul 22, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast routing, convenient windshield mount, ease of use. 
Cons:. short battery life. 
Summary:. I really cannot understand the Cnet review that seriously downgrades the rating of this unit due to a supposed volume issue. I have no problem hearing the verbal instructions even at 40% volume level.. I purchased the unit based on CR review and I couldn't agree more with their assessment of the model - a higly recommended model.. It is inexpensive and does what I want it to do - navigate effectively and it is very user friendly. Your review should factor in price in your rankings. Comparing this model on an equal footing with a $700 or $800 models is of questionable value.. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent performence, clear and loud enough sound. 
Cons:. a bit slow cold start. 
Summary:. This is the best GPS with TTS at entry level. a bit slow in getting signals at cold start but after that it is perfect and very fast in recalculating the route etc.. Highly recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Small. Great window mount. East to use. 
Cons:. Screen cracked for some unknown reason!. 
Summary:. Great little GPS for a small price. I bought mine at PepBoys refurbished for $69.99.. 

$$;
Pros:. Cheap $68 MIR, TTS intuitive easy, sufficient features simple n finite menu No problem with volume mines at 60% and it?s enough but I have a car with sound sealant Screen brightness in sufficient in a mid day 102 sunshine didn?t have any problem.. 
Cons:. Address finding not as progressive, few useful POI, Flimsy Speaker gives cheap output, memory 1 GB no exp slot, Refurb - No map update Only 6 months warranty cannot return just tech support.. 
Summary:. (Refurb) Just got it, used it for 2 days, so far so good... Its must 1st GPS so I am really enjoying it, nothing to compare it to besides some in rental cars and friend's cars. My thoughts are based on my expectations and experience with other electronic gadgets. I must add that I am getting old and loosing the patience and aptitude to play around with the new generation gadgets.. 

$$;
Pros:. Sound volume can actually be turned up, but the manual in the box doesn't say that! To raise volume: main menu - change preferences - Volume Preferences. For battery status, tap Driving View bottom right corner (also not in manual).. 
Cons:. User manual in the box is woefully incomplete. Download better manual: http://download.tomtom.com/open/manuals/one30/refman/TomTom-ONEv4-en-US.pdf Bat life only 2 hrs.; save it hiking by turning unit COMPLETELY off - hold power button down 14 secs.. 
Summary:. Great product - for car, bike, or hike. Easy to use, fits in shirt pocket.. 

$$;
Pros:. Within the volume preferences, there is setting that allows you to adjust the volume to 100% with more than enough volume to be heard within the cab of any vehicle. Along with this feature there is a "Link volume to car speed" which works very well.. 
Cons:. No household wall plug.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great text to speech GPS at an outstandind price point. 
Cons:. Have to fiddle with the USB charging plug occasionally. 
Summary:. I decided to forgo the CNET review and buy this unit based on the reviews of the other users here. Boy am I glad I did! I found absolutely none of the volume issues described by the CNET review. I can only assume she got a defective unit or didn't know how to increase the volume level. I just returned from a week in California and I can say unequivocally that I had zero issues with the volume levels, even in a convertible with the top down at 80 miles per hour.. The 130S is programmed with maps of the entire US and has excellent text to speech functionality. The number of relevant points of interest pre-programmed in this unit is staggering. I found the windshield mount to be rock solid and it is easily detachable.. On the downside, I sometimes have to try to insert the USB plug four or five times before it connects. It just stubbornly doesn't want to be physically connected I guess. I also wish it had an option to enter multiple waypoints on an itinerary (apparently this feature was removed by a firmware update for some reason.) Although I have no reason to right now, in the future it would have been nice to be able to increase the memory via SD card...there is no slot in the 130S.. All in all, this is a fantastic entry level GPS unit.. 

$$;
Pros:. clear directions, good screen, good winshield attachment. 
Cons:. no cons as of yet. 
Summary:. I received my Tom Tom 2 weeks ago, so still have yet to figure out all the options. But, so far, it has performed very well. The attachment mechanism to the windshield is very secure. The screen is bright and clear.. I wanted to comment about the sound quality mentioned in the CNET review. I have had NO problems hearing the voice. In fact, I keep it at 60% volume and can easily hear the voice even with my window open and radio playing. I can only think that the reviewer did not use the Tom Tom attached to the windshield, but rather, kept it on the seat next to him/her. The speaker is on the back of the unit, so can easily be muffled if placed on a seat.. hope this helps.. 

$$;
Pros:. very good reception, highly customizable routes, impressively compact. 
Cons:. lacks bluetooth data, card slot included in LE version, battery life much shorter than NUVIs, possible Quality Control issues in production.. 
Summary:. First, to address the CNET review. When I first got my 130s, I, like the CNET reviewer, thought the sound was horrible and unusably quiet even at maximum volume with the windows rolled up and stereo off. I updated the firmware. No change. I called TomTom, and the support rep had the same problem on her test model, though she attributed it to an old firmware on the test model. I figured if the the support rep, CNET, and I all had the same problem, there must be something wrong with the model. I went to return it the next day, but not seeing anything that I thought rivaled the model, I bought another 130s with the understanding that I could open it in the store and immediately return it if it had a problem. The new one worked just fine, and I'm quite happy with it. However, again, if CNET, the support rep I spoke with and I all got duds, there must be some QC issues with production.. I had a one LE until it was stolen when my car was broken into. That was a really fantastic unit, allowing you to check the weather and traffic through a bluetooth phone with a data plan. And though I didn't end up using it, I'm sure the card slot would come in handy on foreign trips. This unit is missing both of those features, which really set it as the obvious choice at its price point. However unless you really need a much longer battery life and don't care about route customization, I think the One 130s is still the obvious choice against the Nuvi 200 series. It is tiny, gets a signal quite quickly, and its routes are much more customizable than the Nuvi 200. It really amazes me that CNET rates the Nuvis so much more highly, given that TomTom gives so much more functionality for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to Use, Great Price. 
Cons:. None that I've noticed. 
Summary:. I think we have to give the reviwer a pass here on her review. After doing some research on the web, I see that there was a problem with the volume on this device, and there were some defective units sold. The problem has since been fixed, so I guess it's all good. I bought this GPS because I had a TomTom One 3rd Edition, that my daughter took over. I loved the unit, and decided to by another one and let her keep the 3rd edition. I was pleased with the new slimmer design, and the new mount with the 130s. I love this GPS, and does just what I want it to do....that's to get me from point A to point B, at a very affordable price. I find it very easy to use, and pretty accurate, even though I see reviews where people are not to crazy about the maps included in the TomTom. But I would recommend the 130s to anyone looking for a solid, easy to use GPS.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive; light; community;.... 
Cons:. Wall charger needs to be bought separately.. 
Summary:. Well, I had been looking for an entry-level gps for a while now, and had started out from a broad search among Tomtom, nuvi, mio, and other devices in the 150-250 price range. After some internet research I had eventually come to the tomtom, with at that point, a month ago, the new version of this gps not yet available. Hence I waited for the CNET review, and evidently was hugely disappointed when I read the sound quality was so low. Evidently this put me off from buying it, and I continued my search. However, as other reviews appeared here from users, stating that the sound quality was fine, I took the leap and bought the device.. And, consequently, I can confirm there is nothing wrong with the volume of speech, and at its standard 75percent setting is very audible.. On to the other elements of this device. I had operated a Mio gps before, and had had some problems finding my way around its menus. No such thing with this device though, and without touching the manual, I was able to immediatly route my way from home to any other destination, based on address, city, touristic attraction, etc. There are of course some little imperfections, such as a very small coastal village not existing on the map (the streets are there, but it is not indicated as a village). However, looking through the points of interests of a nearby city, I did find the village, but only as a 'beach of ...'. However, now that I know this, and have gotten used to the input system, I find it easy to use.. As for the cold start of the device, that took me some four minutes, but it was heavily clouded and raining at the time, so I suppose a longer startup time is normal then.. As for the directions and routing. Longer routes of around 500 miles evidently can take a while to calculate. You can also put waypoints in your route, which is very useful especially if you want to use it for tourist purposes.. Overall, I am very happy with my choice, and it is a very solid GPS. What i do find somewhat annoying is that one should buy many things separately, such as the wall charger, a pouch to store the device; and that maps are quite pricey. I hope however that mapshare will bring more longevity to my maps, but I cannot pronounce myself on this point, since Im a new user.. 

$$;
Pros:. great first time gps device. 
Cons:. the mac interface is buggy with multiple crashes. 
Summary:. I haven't had any trouble at all with the 130s' audio - it's clear, and loud enough for me to here it well. The device is excellent, overall, and I'd recommend it to anyone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast routing and satellite fix, easy to use, great volume level. 
Cons:. None so far. 
Summary:. Other than a defective unit, it seems that the cnet reviewer dropped the ball on this one. While the default level is too low, it is easily raised. At 85% it was easy to hear the unit with the radio on. The unit is extremely loud if you just look for and adjust the volume settings. Hopefully the Cnet reviewer edits this review and rating. So far I love the unit!. 

$$;
Pros:. Excellent interface, out-of-the-box easy to use.. 
Cons:. Would love a bigger screen size, but @ this price, doubt it.. 
Summary:. Not sure why CNET is saying the volume is too low. I can only imagine they simply could not find it on the interface. The volume control is there, I promise.. I bought this for her, as I was tired of getting phone calls saying "how do I get out of here?" or "I think I took the wrong turn coming home, hailp!" I was surprised how easily SHE got this to work. Very simple to operate, and the text to speech is a huge plus. I save paper &#38; ink now, and googlemaps is something we only LOOK at now.. A good product at an excellent price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to set up and use. Appears durable enough.. 
Cons:. Not 100% reliable. Needs access to satellites to work or doesn't work at all. Loses signal even on sunny days.. 
Summary:. I bought this item after the last time I drove aimlessly about trying to find a destination with just a map and directions. The item works great overall. Some of the time. As packaged, this GPS covers all our needs. Warning: A GPS needs to have clear access satellites. This one needs access to four satellites. If it can?t reach the satellites, you don?t get a signal. When you don?t get a signal the TomTom is totally useless. Picutre a paperweight with graphics on it. I could not get a signal in an area surrounded by a forest. I could not get a signal during an overcast day, and on another day I couldn?t get a signal on a partly sunny day. Good thing I knew the area I could not acquire a signal or I would have been lost. And that did happen a few days later while driving to a new destination. The TomTom lost the signal while I was making a turn and I no longer had directions from the GPS how to proceed after the turn. I wound up pulling into a parking lot to wait for a signal. It took 10 mins to eventually get one. Sometimes, I?ve had to wait as long as 20 minutes to acquire a signal.From then on, I still carry a map and directions in case the TomTom loses its signal. Hence, though I like the concept of the GPS and enjoy using it while it has a signal, it?s too unreliable for me to rate it any higher than I did. If you can?t acquire a signal to guide you, what good is a GPS, any GPS?. Important warning for US consumers: if you purchase anything from the TomTom.com website, or TomTom Home, which connects to the websit, be forewarned that the bill will be processed from their office in Amsterdam, Netherlands and NOT in the USA. As a result, your credit card may or may not charge you a foreign transaction fee/finance charge for the purchase. And note, nowhere on the TomTom website, nor on your receipt nor ahywahere else will you be told this. You won?t find out until you are charged on your credit card. I learned about it in this exact way. My Mastercard charged me 3%.. FYI: I contacted TomTom by phone about this, and they basically don?t care with the reply that ?they?re not required to tell the U.S. consumer anything because not all credit cards charge a fee.? Hello, how many credit card companies do you know of that don?t charge a fee for foreign transactions.I then asked, ?How about just adding a disclaimer to inform your customers that they may incur additonal fees from performing a foreign transaction?? They didn?t care:it?s not their legal responsibility, so they can care less.If you want to buy American, stay away from tomtom. I wouldn?t mind the purchase if I was warned up front, a disclaimer would have made me an informed consumer; a professional courtesy would have been appreciated, but I wasn?t told at all until the credit card company billed me. Shame on you, tomtom. They list an address in the U.S., which is listed as their contact address, as if they are out of the U.S.A., BUT they?re NOT. They deliberately lead you to believe that your purchase is billed in the USA. Are they hiding something here? They do no list their address in the Netherlands. I wonder why. Buyer Beware.. By the way, they were supposed to have called me back WITHIN a week for a Customer Service Representative to explain the terms of their site, not to work with the consumer. NOTE: Its been over a week now and no call has been made to me. I did receive an email that I can't respond to(It comes from Do Not Reply) that says "since you did not contact us, this issue is closed." I did contact them. I'm waiting for that call back.. 

$$;
Pros:. It has a nice bright display. It is not difficult to type because the letters are a decent size. The response time for turn by turn amd calculating position is good. Typing in and finding a destination is quick and easy. It is very user friendly. 
Cons:. I was concerned about the mount adjustability. It is somewhat limited and if you dont like it you have to use a mount made by TomTom. Universal mounts just wont work. But my biggest problem with this GPS is the volume. It just isnt loud enough.. 
Summary:. I went to this unit after having experienced freeze frame from another brand device and was very excited to start using it. The graphics are much brighter. The unit is very user friendly right from the box. You can literally take it out of the box, hang it, plug it and go. The letters are surprisingly large considering the overall size of the display. The response time for " everything " is quick, from entering data, to turn by turn directions. You can hook up to a computer, go on line and update the GPS for software and maps. There is only one complaint I have about the product and that is the speaker volume. With the windows closed, radio off and air off, at max volume, you still cannot hear the speech. I opted for the (One 130 S) and paid extra over the (One 130) for that feature and feel like I paid extra for nothing. Had I known the volumn was so bad I would have either bought the other unit or bought a different brand with comparable features. Sorry, TomTom, you almost have a perfect product but unfortunately the imperfection is a very important one as well as a safety factor to consider.. 

$$;
Pros:. i think that this Tom Tom serves its purpose as a gps and can effectively get you where you need to go. easy to read screen. 
Cons:. it doesn't tell names of roads when talking which is confusing and would def read owners manual before using because navagating through options can be confusing. for some reason i can't test different peoples voices either and battery isnt wonderful. 
Summary:. overall this Gps is pretty decent and will work for what you need it for, just don't expect anything divine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Navigation generally works well. 
Cons:. Horrible name pronunciation, some mistakes. 
Summary:. Generally this unit works OK, but I've experienced some issues that make me less than fully enthusiastic about it. The most obvious one is the text-to-speech pronunciation. The way it tries to pronounce some names is so poor that you can hardly tell what it's trying to say. I live in Southern California, and this thing can't properly say Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Escondido, Riverside or San Diego. Usually, it's just ridiculous and funny, but sometimes I honestly don't know what it's attempting to say. That issue aside, there are a couple other problems I've encountered. It took me right past my destination and instead of telling me to turn left into it, it took me on a little joy ride through a local neighborhood just to turn around and get back to it. Also, when I drove from Vegas to San Diego, we were in an empty stretch of desert and needed to use a restroom. I looked for a rest area and it said it couldn't find any. Then, we came upon one within about 10 miles. That's basic stuff and it should work. However, it did get me through a difficult interchange at one point and generally works OK, so I will keep it despite it's shortcomings. Hopefully they will release an update in the future to fix some of these issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. Quick route calculation. 
Cons:. Map not up-to-date. 
Summary:. While it does quickly route you to a street in its memory, house numbers are usually about 100 yards off. This is surprising because it is able to track your movement as you turn through an intersection.. Also, it doesn't have streets in business parks that are less than 2 YEARS old.. As a delivery driver, I need to be able to get accurate directions to a given address.. 

$$;
Pros:. The unit is small, light weght.. 
Cons:. This is my third ONE line and all 3 have the same undesirable feature...it will turn itself on... I in CA, my brother in FL and niece in MD all have the same malady. We purchased our units from different sources.. 
Summary:. First of all the Phantom activation is a turn off. Secondly, the speaker volume is a too low for highway operation. I have been told (by the unit) that I have reached my destination while still several hundred feet away from destination. The unit will not recognize a short cut that I have selected and constantly tells me to turn around, even though the unit knows where we are on the internal map.. My latest unit is also guilty of uncommanded operation - it turns itself on. I have reported this problem to the service department person, and that person is hiding behind his voice mail and will not return my telephone call.. 

$$;
Pros:. Pros? PROS!!!?. 
Cons:. Seems to always want to take me through the busiest/jammed streets possible!. 
Summary:. Trading it in for a Garmin Nuvii. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple A to B navigation, very compact EasyPort windscreen mount, USB port connection and HOME software for PC, loads additional POIs, connects to optional traffic info receivers.. 
Cons:. Simple A to B navigation, very compact EasyPort windscreen mount, USB port connection and HOME software for PC, loads additional POIs, connects to optional traffic info receivers.. 
Summary:. Sold in Europe as TomTom ONE Europe 22. With this series, TomTom aims at holiday and leisure travellers. We found our ONE producing a more than ample volume. On holiday, it guided us nicely to various destinations. We found the USB port to be too slow for map swapping (Eastern for Western Europe and vice versa) en route. But this ONE lacks the Itinerary Planner of its predecessors, so it is incapable of multidestination trips, contrary to statements of the CNET editorial reviewer. But she is excused, for TomTom didn't inform anyone about the removal of the IP from its latest ONE. You may find more about the missing Itinerary Planner at this blog: &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/hogev/"&gt;http://blogger.xs4all.nl/hogev/&lt;/a&gt;.. Updated. on Sep 3, 2008. 

$$;
Pros:. Good looking, compact design. Easyport mount is compact. Clear, crisp adjustable audio. Maps of different countries are available.. 
Cons:. Mapping SUCKS, customer service ABSOLUTELY sucks. Text to voice is OK except that this unit has trouble pronouncing some street names, especially foreign street names. map corrections are very limited. 
Summary:. OK folks, why do I hate TomTom? I have given this particular unit 3 chances. To use a baseball analogy, 3 strikes and you're out! This is a small, compact GPS. Unfortunately, there is much to be desired not only with this unit but with the whole TomTom line.. I purchased the One 130s 3x from Costco.com. The audio on this unit was very clear and distortion free. The mapping is not too good. I did a search for my brother in-law's address in Lancaster, CA and it could NOT find it. In fact, that whole community is missing from the map. Tech support said that I could do a map correction on the unit. I tried this but you cannot correct something if it doesn't even exist on their map! Tech support tried the same search on a TomTom 730 over the phone. They acknowledged that the address wasn't there. I went to my local retailer and tried looking up the address in their top of the line product - the 930T and again it could not find it. Then, thinking that just a US map would be more updated, I purchased that. WRONG! Same map except no Canada. Then came the real problems with tech support. This is where the lack of "technical" knowledge really came out. Over a three month period I must have called tech support 30-40 times. I did appreciate the fact that when I called, they picked up the phone almost immediately. BUT there were too many instances where anger took over because these people really do not know what they are doing. Being a systems administrator and a gadget geek, I know exactly what I am doing. I was able to find out on my own that downloading their map or updates online needs to be done on a USB 2.0 connection. If not, you will I/O errors because of the speed difference. Could they have told you that? NO because they don't know this. Anyway, somehow the map got corrupted. I did a map update via the computer and somehow it started calling my street which is Douglas Drive, Dover Air Force Base. Just a tad off wouldn't you say? Since this is basically flash storage for map files, storage is limited to 1gb. If you purchase a different map, because of space limitations and no SD card upgrade, you would need to remove one map to put another one on. Throw in your US/Canada map, POI files, voice additions and you're down to a few megabytes of remaining space. This slows down the unit big time.After dealing with TomTom's completely useless technical support, they finally determined that I should send in the unit for repair. Screw that. I returned this 1st unit to Costco and purchased the second unit. Gave 'em a second chance.. On this unit, I could barely hear the audio over the usual road noise and radio being on. This was the main reason for returning this 2nd unit. Gave 'em a 2nd chance.. The 3rd unit came and I have had enough of the mapping and POI issues. 3rd strike and you're out TomTom. I returned the 3rd unit and re-purchased the one I originally bought - a Magellan 3250 which I never should have returned in the first place. No worries about mapping or POI's. Voice command is really limited but I am able to disable this feature. Audio could be louder but the mapping is very reliable and the POI's? Can't go wrong - 6 million POI's. I have been through several brand name changes ie: Garmin 250W, Magellan 3250, Navigon 2100max, the 3 TomTom One 130s' and back to the Magellan 3250. As far as user friendliness, by far the Magellan is the one to get and the most flexible. Most if the time, if you try the unit inside the store, searching is limited because some of these units have trouble finding satellites inside a building. If you happen to purchase this One 130S or any TomTom model, I found out one thing: from the most basic unit to the most expensive, the map is exactly the same on all of them. If you enter an address in the One 130S and cannot find it, enter the same address in the top of the line model and cannot find it, RETURN IT! Put aside all the bells and whistles in the upper models and its the same useless map. I went to a local Best Buy, entered my brother in-law's address on a Garmin and BAMMO there it was! As a consumer stay away from TomTom, Navigon and all the small time companies like MIO or even Sony. Their specialty is audio and video products NOT GPS. If these 2 wannabe's want to play with the big boys, they've gotta listen to the consumers. Garmin and Magellan are so far ahead of TomTom and everyone else its not funny. I hope this review helps!.
