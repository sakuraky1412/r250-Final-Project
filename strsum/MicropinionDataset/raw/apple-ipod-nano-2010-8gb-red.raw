Pros:. awesome.. does what a small mp3 player should - dont' need video or crappy camera ! Yeaaaa! People that are upset are just afraid of change: to you all I say there are plenty of other options if you don't like it... Lighten up.. 
Cons:. None. This is an MP3 player.. if you want camera and movies find another one of the many products out there- including Apples own other options. Geez.. 
Summary:. this is my ideal "MP3 PLAYER" MP3 PLAYER- GET IT! Music player :). 

$$;
Pros:. No idea...how could I have one?. 
Cons:. No idea...how could I have one?. 
Summary:. CNet, you should stop allowing people to review products that aren't on the market yet. Obviously, everyone who has reviewed this so far has NO idea what they're talking about.. 

$$;
Pros:. A tiny iPod shuffle -sized music player that for the first time has a screen and full iPod functionality on it.. 
Cons:. So good it will make me buy one, even though I already have an iPod music player in my iPhone.. 
Summary:. The new iPod nano really replaces the old iPod shuffle, but now you have a screen and controls and aren't limited just to shuffling. This is a massive improvement. If you are missing the camcorder and video playback and other app features from the old nano, for you there is the new iPod touch, with HD camcorder, iMovie video editing, YouTube upload, a display worthy of video, and iOS apps. With how thin and light and full-featured the iPod touch is, it makes sense now to make that the iPod for everything, and make the nano the best choice for those that want a music player only.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use. Clips on to clothing. 
Cons:. Lack of accelerometer. 
Summary:. A lot of people have already commented on some of the cons for this product. I think a lot of people expect that everything that has a screen has to have the capability to play video, play games, etc. With the 6th Gen Nano, Apple has essentially made it a iPod Shuffle on steroids. Sure it's a little better bc you can have pictures on it, etc., but the bottom line is, it's designed to be just like a shuffle only with more memory. So if you're looking for a gadget that can do everything like video and all that, then spend the money for an iPod classic or touch. But, if you're looking for something with more memory than a shuffle, but don't need as many features as the other ones, buy the new Nano.. I used mine for working out on a regular basis and I love it.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great for gym, around campus, that sort of thing when I do not want to lug my phone around.. 
Cons:. Can't make photos your background of touchscreen, no alarm clock/external speaker. 
Summary:. My gripes are minimum on this new nano. I got it a day ago and all in all I think it's solid for what it promises. Apple is phasing out all old gen ipods. This is sad, but it's business as usual. The click wheels of yore will, in a year or two, be gone. Touchscreen is now. If like me you want something for the gym, something small at school and other places, you can't go wrong. The touch features are very intuitive and this is a cool little device. It's screen is the perfect size for album artwork. Also it has the Nike fit that is a nice feature. Overall, if you feel you will use the device for these purposes, it's a buy. Otherwise, don't.. Updated. on Oct 1, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. Giant step forward for the nano design, which was always meant to be a more portable, less feature laden member of the lineup.. 
Cons:. Jury still out on the control functionality, but should not suffer from the roll back of features it never needed. 
Summary:. Video on the Nano? seriously? I see the last generation of the Nano all over my gym, and I've never met anyone who has shot video, or even still shots, with it. Apple correctly rolled back two functions that no one wanted or needed, and replaced them with a form factor that is an improvement to everyone.. I'll reserve judgment on the touch screen controls. The scroll wheel and screen combo was a masterpiece of functional aesthetics that will be hard to improve on.. Over all, Apple did exactly what they needed to do, they maintained the nano in a perfect position between two other highly competitive, iconic products.. 

$$;
Pros:. Plays music without extra features I never use. The screen is very responsive, its light, the battery lasts and the sound quality is as good (with different earphones) as a Zune. The clip is pretty convenient.. 
Cons:. It could be a little bigger, and this interface isn't as intuitive as you'd expect an Apple product to be.. 
Summary:. This is my first Ipod. I bought this because we use Macs at work, and I was a little tired not being able to reorganize my music on my Zune. Also, my Zune's harddrive has been getting stuck a lot, so it was time to find a replacement. The Zune has been the only other MP3 player I've owned, and I was pretty happy with it. I compared the sound quality of the two, and I can't tell the difference.. I actually like this little guy a lot. Its nice to be able to use it at home on my PC and at work on the Mac. I also was looking for a flash player that had a large capacity and a radio. I was debating between this and the Touch and the Sony. I bought the Nano because, honestly, I wouldn't use half the features on a Touch and I've been warned of the software of the Sony. I only used my Zune for music and radio, so I didn't see any point on spending money on something with a lot of whiz-bang features that would just collect dust.. Once you get used to the interface, which is a little confusing at first because you expect it to work like a Touch, using it and exercising with it isn't a problem. I just set it to Genius or one of my running playlists and let it ride when I run or go through my yoga routines. Bear in mind, I don't have delicate or graceful fingers, and I find using the touch interface quite easy.. All in all, I think this is a clever little device that does exactly what it's advertising itself to be: a portable personal music player. No frills, no fluff.. 

$$;
Pros:. the flash maybe. 
Cons:. the touch screen. 

$$;
Pros:. Unlike the old shuffle, the new nano/shuffle has a screen. and it's touchy.. 
Cons:. For a shuffle, no negative points, other than price, of course. If it had to compete with a 5th generation nano, it would be screwed. But no worries, it trounces the old shuffle.. 
Summary:. I dislike any product which moves to less features, has an inadequate UI and attempts to mask it's shortcomings with an almost meaningless touch screen. But ... if it's a replacement for the shuffle, then it kicks ass ... except for it's price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Integral to the tiny piece is its own clip and an FM radio, two of the most frustrating things missing in prior nano models. I love the small size and ability to carry it anywhere.. 
Cons:. I miss use of click wheel by feel when driving, exercising, even napping. The touch bar is too clumsy to find exact spot I am looking for. Using the clip forces a finger onto the wrong place and I activate or deactivate the touch screen unwittingly.. 
Summary:. Unless I want to use the FM radio at a football game, I am finding myself gravitating back to my Gen 4 nano for most uses. I like not having to search for expensive cases/clips and dealing with multi-part contraptions just to create an in-line FM radio. At the same time, listening mostly to books and podcasts, I find it much more difficult to find my place, especially in a multi-part book, with the lack of precision in moving the touch bar with my finger. I do like the 30-second skip back, but it requires taking the nano off, looking at it, swiping to a different screen. Perhaps each of these shortcomings will improve with skill in using the touchscreen.. 

$$;
Pros:. It's an Apple product, so it'll sell. Touchscreen is nice, and as accurate as one expects an Apple touchscreen to be. Has a clip, and Apple keeps shrinking this thing more and more. Also still plays music.. 
Cons:. No video playback, no camcorder, no microphone, no speaker, no games, no calendar, no contacts, no notes, no alarm clock. And no click wheel, the single greatest innovation of the iPod that really got the product off the ground in the first place.. 
Summary:. When one updates a product, one usually adds features. Maybe this one could have taken photos, or added WiFi for over-the-air downloads, or added more games, or something like that. Instead, they take away at least ten features from the last iPod Nano that I know many people loved. People bought the iPod Nano because they wanted an mp3 player with nice features, but couldn't afford the iPod Touch. Now none of those features remain.. Apple's low-end device is the iPod Shuffle. Since it was introduced, the Shuffle had no video playback, camcorder, microphone, speaker, games, calendar, contacts, notes, alarm clock, or click wheel, like the iPod Nano did. Heck, it eschewed BUTTONS for a generation, requiring one to use Apple's headphones to interact in any semi-complex way with it. This was why its price point was lower than the Nano's. THAT player, not the iPod Nano, was always meant to be for those who just want simple mp3 playback. Now the Nano no longer has the feature advantages over the Shuffle (at least beyond the touchscreen); I see more similarities with the iPod Shuffle with the new Nano than I do with the old Nanos.. To be honest, the only thing the Nano has over the Shuffle is a touch screen. A tiny touch screen. With no other means of input. That can only display three lines at a time. I don't understand what else Apple could possibly be telling their customers here, except "You'd better open your wallet more for the iPod Touch, because we're in the process of making that product the only one with any useful features beyond music playback". Apple was the LEADER in recognizing that users wanted more features than music playback. Now they're forcing you to pony up an extra $80 for an 8 GB iPod Touch if you want to play a game.. The real kicker is the lack of a click wheel, though. When was the last time you saw a non-Touch iPod that required you to look at the screen? That's what buttons are for. So when you're driving with the thing hooked up to your radio, you don't have to look at the screen to change songs and crash into the car in front of you. So you don't have to slow down when you're running or at the gym. So you can access it quickly from your pocket. We all knew the drill: reach in your pocket, flick off the hold switch, press the forward button, flick the hold switch back on. Now we have to physically bring the Fun Size screen close enough to our faces that our noses accidentally trigger the Multi-Touch. What? And you're calling this the next generation of the iPod Nano, the single best-selling mp3 player in history?. Try again, Apple. If consumers want a simple mp3 player, the shuffle is for them. If they want a feature-packed entertainment hub with practically unlimited features, and have a little more money to spend, they buy the iPod Touch. The Nano was what most consumers wanted: a good balance between price and features. Everything you needed for some good fun, some extra cool stuff thrown in there, at a price point that didn't break the bank. No longer.. This product is unreasonable, overpriced, mean-spirited, and disloyal to customers that use the Apple logo as a status symbol. It has very little going for it, the same mid-range price for low-range features, and is in general a major step backwards from the value that was the last-gen Nano. Shame on Apple for what amounts to flicking off their consumers.. But it DOES play music. And it IS an Apple product. We all know what that means: huge sales.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, has a clip, sleek as usual.. 
Cons:. can't use the thing without looking at it, can't turn it off, ugly, total downgrade, expensive, complete waste, lacks features.. 
Summary:. I don't know what iPod was thinking. First, calling it an iPod Nano. It is not at all like the other models; I agree with everyone else, this should be a new kind of shuffle. Actually, they shouldn't have made it at all. The interface looks ugly; the four widgets per screen just doesn't work, and the few that they give you look really awkward next to each other, no matter how you mix it up. There is really no point to this touchscreen bs. I really don't see it, even in a sarcastic way. Apple products are expensive, but this small useless thing should've been 70-100 dollars, not 150. Apple seems to have forgotten things aren't JUST supposed to be pretty. Some losers will buy this for the touchscreen, but that's it. All this does is play music, with a few tiny perks. I can't see the thing going far. I wasted so much money. I really won't use it. I won't even give it away because no one should own this. No one. I hope I can still buy another 5G.... 

$$;
Pros:. Pretty to look at.. 
Cons:. When you turn it "off," the screen burns off, but it still consumes power.. So you can't really count on it having a good charge if you plan to leave it in your gym bag a few days without charging it.. 
Summary:. I was pretty surprised to learn right after buying my new Nano that you can't turn the thing off. You can make it "sleep," and you can wake it up, but you can't turn it off. I thought I must be doing something wrong, until a discussion forum post pointed me to this nugget on page 15 of the user manual: "Note: iPod nano continues to use battery power after it?s been turned off." So if you wait a few days between charges, or maybe you threw it in a suitcase or a gym bag -- it will have a less juice on it the next time you pick it up. From what I've read in the discussion forums, the standby time may not be more than a day or 2.. Aside from the battery problem (which is the reason why I'm going to return the Nano I already bought), it's disappointing to lose nice features like being able to create an "on-the-go" playlist.. In my humble opinion, this is really an upmarket shuffle, not an improved nano. And given the choice between this one and my older Nano, I'm keeping my old one -- it's easier to use and does more.. 

$$;
Pros:. I DONT LIKE THIS SMALL IPOD NANO IS TO SMALL. 
Cons:. EVERYONE BOYCOTT IPOD NANO 6TH GENERATION TO LOWER DOWN THE PRIVE TO $99.00. 
Summary:. STEVE JOBS IS A RIP OFF DO BUY IPOD TO APPLE GO PICK ANOTHER COMPANY LIKE SONY AND SANDISK WHY IT HAS TO BE IPOD IT JUST A NAME!. 

$$;
Pros:. Beautiful screen, iOS. 
Cons:. touchscreen hard to use while working out, no longer a good option for nike+ users, requires the user to slow pace and look at screen to use, what happened to video?. 
Summary:. I have owned 3 nanos primarily for use while running and to use nike+. The 6th gen is a disaster. The touchscreen is impossible to use while running. It requires way too much attention and is a complete distraction. The on-screen controls are so small that you have to slow your pace to hit them accurately and you have to actually look at the screen to use it. I bought the 6th gen specifically to use while running and to use with the Polaris nike+ heart rate monitor (the nike+ heart rate monitor can only be used with gen 5 &#38; 6 nanos) I plan to give this 6th gen to my wife and go to Best Buy to see if they still have any 5th gens in stock.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size will appeal to those looking for a more fully-featured shuffle. Touch screen will appeal to some. Great battery life for size.. 
Cons:. Screen much smaller than before. Fiddly touch interface. Long title, artist and album names are truncated - big issue on such a small screen. Loss of extra features.. 
Summary:. This product aims to redefine the nano line into a streamlined portable music player. The size and presence of a clip is clearly pitching this as un upgrade to the iPod Shuffle.. Unfortunately, a few key mistakes severely cripple the device's ability to excel in this category. The size makes one handed operation virtually impossible, unlike with the previous click-wheel models. The small screen means much less will fit on there, and coupled with the necessity to make UI elements larger for use with the touch interface, browsing through a large music collection quickly becomes impractical. Compounded with this is the issue prevalent in all iOS devices - the inability to handle long titles gracefully. With such a small screen, the fact that names that are too long are simply truncated would be a major headache for a large number of users.. It would seem that Apple has taken the viewpoint that usability is now uncool.. 

$$;
Pros:. Touchscreen is nice, as well as the radio tuner. works great for exercising, and is very light weight, easy navigation.. 
Cons:. No games, no video playback, no speaker, no calendar, not really anything except playing music.. This nano is just an iPod shuffle with a screen. Don't buy this one, just wait for the seventh generation.. iPod shuffle with screen. worth $50 - $80.. 
Summary:. -Only thing it does is play music, radio, pedometer, and photos.. -Lightweight.. -Great product for someone who wants just a music player, but for a person like me who uses it for multiple things, then don't get it. I would give it a 4 or 5 star review if it was $50 - $80. The $150 price is WAY too high for this, you can buy a generic 8 or 16 gig MP3 player WITH touchscreen for $50 or less.. Apple did this for a reason to the nano. This is the new era of nano, and anytime they make a new product, they make it with bare minimum hardware and software, and make the next gen of the product have a lot more features, so that you MUST rebuy.. BUYER BEWARE of this iPod Shuffle/Nano.. 

$$;
Pros:. supports product red. 
Cons:. poor design; mine stopped working after four days of using it at the gym as it was diagnosed by a genius to have been "water damaged" when the dock connector is designed to be upside down when clipped on your left collar...DESIGNED TO ABSORB SWEAT!!!. 
Summary:. I'm stuck with a defective item that Apple refuses to take responsibility for, stating it was my fault it got water in it...so unless Apple had a disclaimer for users not to use this 6th generation nano when running/working out or to not clip it on your left collar as it would it is DESIGNED TO ABSORB SWEAT that later on would be diagnosed as "water damaged" since probably a drop of sweat went through the doc connector, I don't think I should be left with a $149 piece of crap!. 

$$;
Pros:. Touch screen is a good idea for the nano. 
Cons:. No video!!! and alot less features. Also harder to navigate from lists of songs.. 
Summary:. I think they should have made it the same size as the past 2 nano's but with a screen that takes up the whole front of the device, keeping all the features.. 

$$;
Pros:. ...Touch screen?. 
Cons:. No accelerometer, very awkward size, 4 apps per page, step backward with no camcorder, step backward for gym users who now must slow down pace to fiddle with this weird device. 
Summary:. Ok, I think I can explain what happened here: somehow an iPod shuffle bred with a broken Zune HD.. I really don't understand how or why this nano happened. I still have my original nano, and adore it. I got a creative zen microphoto, and went back to the nano with half the space. It was a great product. And the newer models have since adapted with newer technologies. But what happened here? Is it just because touch screens are in, and people are gullible and will buy it? Ok fine apple, make me hate you more. Seriously this product makes no sense. Apple has two unique, niche products in the shuffle, the most popular gym music player, and the iPod touch, the only current iteration of a tablet that makes any sense. THE TWO SHOULD NOT BE COMBINED!! I mean coffee machines are great. Wireless mice are great. It doesn't mean you combine the two.. Why Apple, just why?. 

$$;
Pros:. Has a clip.. 
Cons:. No video, no speaker, no camera, no contacts, no notes, no calendar. Just exactly like the old shuffle but with a little more memory and a lot more price.. 
Summary:. Update the nano (or drop it if that is what you are trying to do) and remarket this as the shuffle. What a horrible, horrible idea.. 

$$;
Pros:. Would be nice if it came with a watch band and an Omega watch app.. 
Cons:. Touch screen makes product useless to use during a workout. Can't do anything without looking at the screen.. 
Summary:. Sold my nano 5G a couple of weeks before the iPod announcement for almost list price. Was going to get a 2010 model with more storage since 16GB isn't enough. Instead Apple came out with this useless gizmo. Left the store disgusted. Going to take some of my money and get a 32GB microSD card for my Android phone, since I carry it to track my workouts' distance and heart rate anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. absolutely nothing. 
Cons:. touch screen - you now need to look at the device to do anything. lost features from previous ipod nanos. 
Summary:. Same size as shuffle with touch screen, if I wanted something this small I would get the shuffle, if I want a touch screen I would get the ipod touch. This "new and improved" nano is the worst of both worlds and not worth buying..
