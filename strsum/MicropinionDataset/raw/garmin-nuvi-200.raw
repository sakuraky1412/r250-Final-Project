Pros:. Small easy to use entry level GPS.. 
Cons:. Fee required for new maps after the 1st free map update.. 
Summary:. I work in travel industry and when Global Resort Services customers ask me, I can tell them with total confidence that it works great. I recommend it every time anyone is going on a trip and I've yet to get any complaints in two years. I know it doesn't have all the features as the more expensive models, but it gets the job done well. Plus, it is small. You'll never have trouble finding some where to put it. I've updated the maps when I 1st got it and haven't found the need to update again. I've travel easily over 1,000 miles across the U.S.A. using it and maps were accurate for me.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, simple interface.. Small, portable, can put it in pocket or glove comp.. Battery power lasts several hours. Lifetime updates at Garmin are only $119, up to 4 times per year forever!. Windshield mount is solid yet adjustable.. 
Cons:. Can be annoying going around detours, continually recalculating. Not a big deal.. No one-time free update with my nuvi 200, my father-in-law's 260 got one freebie. 
Summary:. I use this every day for my job, estimating glass replacement in homes in the Denver metro area. 5-6 unique home addresses per month, and even though I haven't updated in the last year, it has only missed 2 addresses (very new developments).. We used a garmin in a rental car in Florida, and loved it there. My in-laws bought us this for our anniversary last year.. Bottom line, if I broke or lost this unit, I would immediately buy another. Can't imagine my job without it. So nice not having to look for streets on the map and wondering how far to the next turn, particularly on some of the highways in the downtown area. Wow. And if the address doesn't show up on the Garmin, just find it on Google maps &#38; send to the GPS. You'll be fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. dead easy to use,there are upgrades for new map register with garmin first.. there is brightness control and volume settings as there are many others,poi's can be upgraded just done mine,change pointer to car truck arrow simple as abc.. 
Cons:. takes a few mins to get the gist of the menus because there are sub menus in there for the nav,odd I know but there we have it study it first then play.. 
Summary:. I got one recently,had to take time going through the menu to get what I wanted on display.it won't do speed check when in navigation mode,it will on map.. maybe it's me I will sort it some time great fun to use and garmin remember started it all off so who better for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. Loads quickly very accurate . Hold charge well. Easy to read 3 d graphics voice instructions. Suction cup work great on window, cord fits under dash indentation.. 
Cons:. Pass lock can be a problem at times. Resets itself if you go to preset location.It picks the shortest route not always the fastest route via interstate as have lived over spralling okie city for 35 years.. 
Summary:. Got on ebay for 114 shipping included. Still see it in that price range in amazon and ebay. Many are refurbished such as mine but some are not. Favorites nice feature keeps track of all places input. Has home feature that gps's you back to set home location. GIves you up to date map for 08 only needs to be updated every two years. Canada and alaska not included.. 

$$;
Pros:. Totally intuitive interface; clear, bright screen; effortless satellite acquistion, pinpoint accuracy, instant map refresh even at highest detail, automatic switching between day/night mode. 
Cons:. Wish it had a battery level / charging indicator. 
Summary:. I've tried many different GPS nav aids, all with some level of disappointment, inconvenience or sheer exasperation, but at last I'm totally content, GPS-wise. This inexpensive, tiny device worked perfectly every time, with no learning curve and an elegant, bright, clear display (easily readable in daylight even at 30 % brightness) and interface. One unexpected pleasure: the relatively small size isn't a problem, in fact it's an advantage, because when mounted on windshield or dash, the map is at the perfect size to be read without having to refocus from the road, and it blocks very little of the driver's field of vision; its graphics end up ideal for switching back and forth from road to map, like a heads-up display. Add a very pleasant voice, and surprisingly good speakers on a device smaller than an iPod Classic. Data entry is greatly enhanced by an AutoFill that covered every address and location I tried; I never had to hit more than 3 letters. Just a delight, and at around $200, an amazing value.. 

$$;
Pros:. Love the build of the case, and that it's not too light, not too heavy. Battery life is 8-9 hours, and, when the battery does die, you charge off USB. This is handy if you own a BlackBerry or a RAZR, as you can use your phone wall or car charger.. 
Cons:. Touch screen is hard to use with gloved of frozen hands. Satellite locks inside the vehicle are slower than I would like. On the upside, I used this particular model heavily in Europe and Dubai and it locked on to the sat inside buildings. YMMV.. 
Summary:. Best GPS you can buy for under a $150, and going for $99 in most places nowadays.. Make the move now.. 

$$;
Pros:. Gets you where you need to go, many POI's available, route recalculation is really fast and effective, very accurate location.. 
Cons:. No music mp3 player, but, what the heck? Everybody has a radio/cd/cassette player anyway.. 
Summary:. The Nuvi 200 is an excellent gps for say, the average traveler. It gets you where you want to be, you can look up addresses, find places in the POI section, carry information on an SD card with you, the battery lasts forever, and I could go on, and on. Basically, it's definitely worth the money! I've had mine since the beginning of June, and so far, it's taken me halfway across the United States without failing! It's great, and I love mine!. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use..clear display. 
Cons:. street names not audible in "turn by turn" directions. 
Summary:. Found a $50 coupon online for Best Buy and bought the Nuvi 200 after coupon for $100. You get what you pay for here, but for a $100 it does the job saving $$$$ compared to other Garmin units. Easy to hook up and update. Nice display and visible directions. It would have been nice to here the street names you are to turn onto instead of just watching the display but for $100 I really can't complain much. Need a basic unit, this is the one to get.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, Price, User Friendliness. 
Cons:. Battery life, No AC charger. 
Summary:. Never having owned an auto GPS before I am very pleased with this unit. It is very easy to use and has more features than would be expected at this price point. If you just want a basic GPS this is the one to buy IMO. Best routing of the major three and now has updated maps.. 

$$;
Pros:. Inexpensive, Easy to Use. 
Cons:. Minimal User guide, no AC adapter, no Zip Code locator. 
Summary:. I bought my 200W at Sam's Club for $179 and change. I've been looking at auto GPS systems for some time, but didn't want to spend a lot because I really only need one for navigating the whacky roads in Massachussetts and Maine. I don't need or want Bluetooth or MP3 in a GPS. I just want an accurate, easy to use GPS. I have that, and some more, in the 200W.. Mine has a black casing, not the silver, and I prefer the black to silver. Parked in my narrow driveway situated between my 2 1/2 story house and my neighbor's 2 story carriage house garage my 200W found an initial setup satellite signal in less than a minute. Didn't even place the unit outside the cab of the truck to 'find' the signal. Set my driveway as my Home favorite &#38; the rest of the options in less than 5 minutes. The one thing I can't find in the Menu settings, which the unit is supposed to have, is turn-on at vehicle start up. I'll find it. I chose the British voice to the default American voice. Sexier, IMO.. The battery was fully charged out-of-the-box. Maps are pre-loaded, and no updates available through Garmin. I'll purchase the Canadian map because my GF drives through Canada when travelling to Michigan. I'll also eventually buy the USB cable and carrying case. Don't need them at the moment.. I don't have a problem with the lack of case or USB cable. You get what you pay for with anything technological, and I paid for what I wanted. A good, good, basic unit.. I do think Garmin should have added the Zip Code option to the Menu and an AC adapter. Both would have been truly helpful, but ... I opted not to spend more for a Garmin 750 or the added bells and whistles.. The 200W does exactly what I wanted, for what I wanted to spend. It is an absolutely terrific device.. 

$$;
Pros:. Touch Screen Works, Wide Screen, Easy to Read, Accurate, POI database, Trip Calculator. 
Cons:. Wish the Entry Keyboard was QWERTY. 
Summary:. I recently bought the 200W at Circuit City for $249.99. I recommend the extra $50 for the widescreen model. It displays more info and just looks sleeker, too. I use Garmin GPS in aviation and it's the best there, but very expensive. The amount of information and accuracy of this unit is incredible and it's very easy to use with the touch screen. I found the price to be a bargain. It has all the features I am looking for in a GPS. Other models have MP3, etc, but this works for me. Most of my travel is within 300 miles of home and the installed map works fine, even on Seattle's crazy one-way streets. For comparison, my dad bought a Garmin Street Pilot in 2004. It cost over $1,000 and except for the slightly bigger screen, doesn't do anything more than my Nuvi.. 

$$;
Pros:. screen size, ease of use, speed. 
Cons:. None that I have found yet!. 
Summary:. I got the Nuvi 200W as a birthday gift. I wasn't really sure that I even needed a GPS, so an entry level one was more than I needed. Wow, this thing is amazing! Not only does it calculate routes quickly and easily, but it's nice to have just to tell you where you are at, and what streets are near you. For an entry level device, this thing does everything I could want and more. I wasn't interested in one that had bluetooth for phone compatibility or advanced speech, etc. Just clear, simple directions that make sense and get me to my destination. Overall, I am very impressed with this device. The only thing I would advise is to get the 200W since the widescreen makes typing a bit easier.. Overall, an amazing driving companion!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Better Screen-Bigger Screen. 
Cons:. Just read my review. 
Summary:. I needed a new GPS after my Lowrance iWay 500c just died on me (it was a gift so I am not crying about the lost that much). Let me tell you DO NOT BUY an iWay 500c. It is a piece of crap! In July, 2007 I bought the TomTom Go 720 for my wife. I wanted a GPS for myself and after having my Lowrance iWay 500c stop working on me I did some shopping for another GPS. I came across the Garmin Nuvi 5000. Wow, this unit has a huge 5.2 inch screen but is so light and thin. If you like Garmin products but want a bigger screen then this is it. It has the latest maps, POIs, and features already install and ready to go! The routes (directions) are perfect every time unlike the iWay 500c. Go to www.garmin.com and read up on this bad boy. It is worth ever dime that it is selling for. All GPSs have their pros and cons. NONE OF THEM ARE PERFECT. What I like and dislike about the Garmin Nuvi 5000 and the TomTom Go 720 are the following:. Likes (Garmin Nuvi 5000):. 1.)	Nice, bright, big screen. 2.)	Directions are accurate. 3.)	Speaks the street names often and clearly. 4.)	Great POIs database (maybe the best I have seen in a GPS). 5.)	MSN DIRECT-Excellent!!!! (Traffic, Move Times, Weather, Local Events, Gas Prices, News, and Stocks-WOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!). 6.)	Great looking maps. I think people are jealous when they ride by me and see my GPS or may be they want to steal it-I dont know. 7.)	GPS is very light and non-bulky for its size.. Dislikes (Garmin Nuvi 5000):. 1.)	Routing and re-routing calculations are not as fast as the TomTom Go 720. It needs to be a little faster for my taste, because it can be a little bit slow.. Likes (TomTom Go 720):. 1.)	FAST routing and re-routing (the fastest I have ever seen in a GPS).. 2.)	Very easy to pick alternate routs.. 3.)	Good to some what great directions, but sometimes screwy.. 4.)	Mapshare. Dislikes (TomTom Go 720):. 1.)	TERRBLE mount!!! I had to buy a 3rd-party mount because the one that it came with it didnt hold the GPS well. The GPS kept falling off the windshield.. 2.)	The screen washes out to much in bright sunlight.. 3.)	Though the GO 720 speaks the street names, but it doesnt speak them as often or clearly as the Garmin Nuvi 5000.. 4.)	The screen could be bigger for my taste.. 5.)	Traffic capability is expensive and the coverage is not as big as the MSN Direct with Garmin.. 6.)	No Move Times, Weather, Local Events, Gas Prices, News, and Stocks features like the Garmin Nuvi 5000 with MSN Direct.. So you make your choice, but what ever you do DONT BUY THE LOWRANCE IWAY 500C!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

Pros:. bright display, intuitive user-interface, Mac-compatible. 
Cons:. cities &#38; towns not listed on 'Favorites' list. 
Summary:. I bought the wide-screen version of the Nuvi 200, the Nuvi 200W and have been very happy. Initially, the main CNET quibble was with the Nuvis price-point. Too high, they said. However, the 200W can now be found for less than $230 through various on-line vendors.. Heres what I like most about the Nuvi 200W. First, you get essentially the same navigation performance and map-sets as higher-end Nuvis. Second, Garmin has done a very good job at providing an interface to Apple Macintosh computers. That means a way to add POI lists (through Garmins own POI Loader software) and a way to update your firmware as updates come out. Third, the display quality and brightness are phenomenal. I chose the wide-screen because I figured that it would afford me a view of nearby parallel highways and roads that the standard square screen might not. Fourth, the user interface is very intuitive.. On the negative side, only small things. First, while the manual is somewhat lacking you can figure things out simply by getting in and playing with the unit itself. Only chronically lazy people complain about manuals. Second, in your 'Favorites' list it doesn't indicate the city/town for each entry. You have to click each one to get further information (such as the city, the phone number, and so on). This is very minor in the whole scheme of things.. I would recommend the Nuvi 200W to anyone who is looking for a first-time GPS unit and who has also taken stock of the features they really need (and those they dont). I rationalized that higher-priced units only yielded more features, not better performance. The MP3 player and Bluetooth found on higher-end Nuvis didnt appeal to me. The text-to-speech capability did initially appeal to me&until I heard it botch Muscatanipus Road during a demo.. Understand that the navigation technology and maps are pretty much the same across the Nuvi landscape, although you will NOT get Canada with the 200 or 200W. You will need to get the Nuvi 250 if maps of Canada are important.. 

$$;
Pros:. ease of use, size, weight, portability, design. 
Cons:. none that I can think of. 
Summary:. For a sub $200 price tag there is no beating this GPS. It is very easy to use, boots up quickly, and re-routes quickly if you choose the miss the next turn. The build quality is EXCELLENT and the screen is so bright that you can actually read it under sunlight.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to master, Quick satellite acquisition. 
Cons:. Wish it had the AC adapter standard. 
Summary:. Very impressed with this prodcut right out of the box. Amazed how quick it aquired the satellite signal. I have a factory installed Nav system in my Nissan Mirano and the Nuvi 200 was quicker. The unit is a "no brainer" to use. You'll spend more time learning how to make microwave popcorn. then how to use this unit. I wear hearing aids and the voice command were plenty loud.. I even have to turn it down to about 70% volume. The screen is very crisp, the keys are plenty big to press. Garmin really has another winner with the 200.. 

$$;
Pros:. Intuitive interface, size, speed. 
Cons:. Lacks QWERTY keyboard layout. 
Summary:. I received the Garmin Nuvi 200 as a Christmas gift. If there's one person in my family who needs one of these, I'm the one. Seriously, I can get lost in 5-bedroom houses.. The Garmin Nuvi makes several strong impressions very quickly. Removing it from the box, one can sense a feeling of quality in the construction of the unit. At first I was dismayed by the apparent lack of documentation, but that's because virtually none is needed.. The Garmin operating system is incredibly intuitive. I had it up and running in about a minute, after I charged the battery. I found the touch screen to be very responsive, and the processor is very fast. Basically zero lag after you press a function. It's fractionally faster than the navi in my mom's 2007 Acura MDX.. In addition, the screen is VERY bright with excellent contrast. This is one reason I had hesitated to get a portable GPS. Not to worry with the Nuvi 200. It doesn't wash out in even the brightest sunlight.. My only complaint about the Nuvi 200 is that you must enter data using a standard ABCD keyboard layout. A strange oversight on Garmin's part, but most people are most familiar with a QWERTY layout. This would speed up inputs considerably, the standard layout is okay. I have read that Garmin is considering offering a firmware upgrade at some point that includes a QWERTY layout.. The default settings offer 3-D mapping to your destination. Streets and intersections are very clearly marked. A tap of the text bar on the top of the screen gives you a direction list, and a simple +/- offers zoom in/zoom out. If you make an error, backing out of a screen in instantaneous.. Voice prompts are very clear and easy to understand and the speaker offers plenty of volume. Also included are a calculator, world clock, and currency converter, which would be useful if you were to use the Nuvi 200 on foot. There's a photo viewer included, and it works well.. All told, I am very pleased with the Garmin Nuvi 200. It's got all the features I need for what I'm going to use it for. Recommended!. 

$$;
Pros:. Simple user interface, perfect size, fast route calculations. 
Cons:. Lack of features, can take a few mins to acquire satelites. 
Summary:. I purchased this GPS because of the garmin name and the small size. I have used the C340 before this one, and was very pleased with the ease of use. There are a few features that i would like, but i knew that i would not get them with this base model unit. I have had this unit for 6 months and have been very pleased over that time. Only a few gripes:. The reset button is easy to press, having lost my info accidently once. Only twice has the unit locked up when recalculating a route. Turning the unit off and on will clear the lock up. 

$$;
Pros:. Ease of use, affordable, compact, and portable. 
Cons:. none really. 
Summary:. Throw out the Thomas guides! You will be more than satisfied with the Nuvi 200. I purchased mine prior to leaving for a road trip (7,000 miles)to Mt. Rushmore, Pensacola, Biloxi, Atlanta, Memphis, Little Rock, Austin, and back to Sacramento. The only difficulty was finding our hotel in Atlanta. The problem, too many Peachtree streets! The desk person said, "All GPS devices have trouble finding their hotel and puts all in the same wrong location." The desk person knew exactly where I was located before I told him!. The voice commands without using the street commands was more than adequate. In many cases while conversing with whomever your driving with, you couldn't hear the first words anyway, but you can sure hear, TURN LEFT or other commands.. It's a great device and let's face it, if you currently travel with AAA trip tickets, maps, or Thomas Guides, this will not only get you there, but gives you time of arrival!. I love my Garmin Girl!. 

$$;
Pros:. touch response, map features, size, easy setup. 
Cons:. software out of date, no charger, no bluetooth. 
Summary:. This is the first GPS device I've owned and, so far so good. After opening the package, it took about 30 seconds to suction it to my windshield and be up and running. Established a satellite connection in about 60 seconds and I've been mapping routes ever since. I really like the included mount, it works great if you hook it to your dash or to the windshield. Also , really like the re-calculate route feature. If you're in the wrong lane or there's construction the device does a good job of getting you a new route to work with.. The only downside, I noticed the software out of the box was a bit out-dated. There were some listings in there that no longer exist. It seems you can download updates , which I have yet to do. The other cons: No cable or bluetooth for connecting to my computer or other devices, so I need to purchase a USB cable. Also, the only way to charge the device is to use the cigarette lighter, it would be nice if it came with a regular outlet adapter.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use.. 
Cons:. No wall charger and no case.. 
Summary:. I purchased this item at Best Buy on Black Friday and only paid $169. However I would pay the current price for this model. Gives all the features you need. I have a built in GPS in my Lexus and the Garmin performs just as well. I would recommend this model to anyone interested.. 

$$;
Pros:. Super-fast detour recalculation; Accurate and latest map; Lowest price Nuvi;. 
Cons:. No Canada map; No Street-To-Text;. 
Summary:. I was torn between Tom Tom One (3rd Edition) and the Garmin Nuvi 200. My friend has an old Tom Tom One. I found that the calculation is a little bit slow, both during the start and detour calculation, but their low price is really attractive (USD149 in Nov 2007). I want to buy a basic Garmin Nuvi model after reading many Internet reviews, but the high price tag stopped me from taking any action. When I found that BestBuy is offering Garmin Nuvi 200 at US$169.99 (reg. 299 in other chain stores) during the Thanksgiving 2007, I bought it without much hesitation since it is even cheaper than the Garmin StreetPilot.. This is a gift for my wife so that she can drive by herself to shopping malls in other township (a very good investment for any husband). What she need is an accurate GPS with fast calculation (you dont want to hear any complaint from your wife) and easy to use menu (women can spend hours to shop but cannot spend two minutes to read the user manual). The Garmin Nuvi 200 fully meets these requirements.. We bought it this morning and use it today. The menu is intuitive and we entered the destination without any problem. The unit received the satellite signal and calculated the route within 10 seconds. We used it to guide the way to two shopping malls and one restaurant before going back home. The selected routes are good. We tried several time to detour from the original route and the recalculation is very fast (talking about a few seconds). On highway, it prompts the voice signal about 1 mile before the turning point, and it gives the second prompts at about 100 feet. On city streets, it prompts the voice signal about 300 to 200 feet, and gives the second signal at about 20 to 50 feet. The positioning is very accurate and the prompt is giving at good intervals.. Pros:. 1.	Extremely fast recalculation. It recalculates the new route within a few seconds when we drove away from the normal route.. 2.	Better and newer Map than Tom Tom One.. 3.	Simple to use menu.. 4.	Fast respond on the menu, there are no delay on selection and map. But the POI search is rather slow.. 5.	Many POIs to select. Especially the selection of restaurant by cuisine.. 6.	Lowest price in Garmin Nuvi series. Cons:. 1.	No Canada map built in. (Nuvi 260 which contains Canada). 2.	No Zip code selection. (Little bit inconvenient). 3.	Slow POI search. (especially when you want to search locations beyond the 5 miles radius). 4.	No Street-To-Text function. (Nuvi higher end models have it at higher price tag). 5.	No fancy features like the MP3 player or Bluetooth. (who needs these added features for a basic GPS). Compare with Tom Tom One (3rd Ed):. 1.	Nuvi 200 has better map and faster calculation. Tom Tom One (3rd) compensate this weakness with the user group uploaded correction on map, this is a very good feature using the users group power. Yet I prefer the out-of-the-box ready to use one and try to avoid the trouble to do the loading of correction.. 2.	Tom Tom One has more flexible way to plan the alternative route (e.g. road block aheads). Nuvi 200 cannot beat Tom Tom One here.. 3.	Tom Tom One has more flexible way to selection destination (e.g. by zip code; by crosss road; by road name). Nuvi 200 is restricted to boring State-City-Street.. 4.	Tom Tom One includes both USA and Canada. Nuvi 200 has USA 50 only, buying additional map SD Card is rather expensive for this beginner model.. Initially, the great user interface of Tom Tome One on destination and POI selection looks very attractive. But after weight in the lack of selection of restaurant by cuisine and the slow detour recalculation in Tom Tome One, I still feel that Garmin Nuvi 200 is a better choice for me.. Bottom Line:. Both me and my wife like Garmin Nuvi 200's fast and accurate detour recalculation. The simple menu is very easy to use without looking at the menu. Best value for the money especially when the price is lowered in this holiday season to US$ 169.99.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, portable and acurate.. 
Cons:. Sometimes takes a while to find satellites. 
Summary:. I'm geographically challenged! I've been looking to get a GPS for a while but didn't want to send $500+ to get one. This unit came to woot.com and I grabbed it. My wife and I took a trip to Chicago and I was able to pack it in my carry on bag. It got us all around town with no problems. I don't care that it doesn't tell you which street to turn on, it does tell you to turn (and the street name is on the unit).. This is very affordable and very easy to use. I went to Garmin's site to make sure I had the latest updates (also very intuitive).. I highly recommend this GPS!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Works like a charm. 
Cons:. Lacks Text Speech for the price.. 
Summary:. FOr entry level automotive GPS, this is the winner. DOn't buy that TOMTOM One...I'm warning you now. This does mostly everything that my NAVI in my 2006 Acura TL can do, which cost me an extra $3000 for. Trust me, this is the champion in the $250 price range.. 

$$;
Pros:. provide a lot more features than expected. 
Cons:. takes some time to load up. 
Summary:. i was quite surprised by this gps which i received as a present from my wife. although it takes a while to load up but it has a wealth of info on this little machine. when i looked different restaurants or local stores it not only gave me the address but it also provided me with their phone numbers which was an unexpected bonus. all my friends were impressed by this intuitive machine.. 

$$;
Pros:. User friendly, maps updated and fresh, handy little box. 
Cons:. Lacks bluetooth. 
Summary:. I`m so happy with this little thing. It`s so intuitive to use, and it actually works. The voice tells me where to drive, and the maps are accurate. I highly recommend this unit, if you want a reliable and not too expensive GPS. You don`t need to be a rocket scientist to use this GPS. The menu system is explanatory.. 

$$;
Pros:. No flip up antenna - Bright screen. 
Cons:. Only one power source -in car, No text to speech. 
Summary:. I had a Garmin 350 last year until it got ran over accidently. Great GPS,fast forward to now.. I was about to order another one when the Garmin 200 series came to the market.. I did some research and figured why not go for an entry level GPS.. I found that the 350 had many features that I just didn't use,and the 200 just fit the bill.. The great thing is that the A/C charger that came with my 350 also works with my 200.. I did notice that the 200 has a little trouble finding satellites indoors, but outside in the car I never lost reception.. This is a GPS you could buy for your parents and they would have very little trouble using it.. This GPS doesn't have text to speech, but after having a GPS with it, I really didn't miss it that much,and it can't be beat at its price point.. The maps could use a little update and you have to search a little while to find certain POI's.. Over all this is an excellent GPS.. I found it at Shipdog.com for under $300.00!. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact size, quickly recalculates routes, lots of POIs. 
Cons:. Doesn't come with wall charger or carrying case. 
Summary:. All I wanted was a basic, no-frills, affordable GPS unit. I've searched stores, the internet, and CNet looking for one that would fit my needs. At first, Tom Tom One seemed a viable solution; it's cheap, basic, and has that nice compact size quality I look for in all my gadgets. It received fairly good reviews on CNet, but I could not get over the cons I kept reading. I wanted a Garmin brand because it seemed more reliable, but I could not get over the price. I don't need to look at pictures on it or listen to mp3s (I already have an 80g iPod). All the extras were things that wasn't important to me. A calculator? Currency converter?? I saw it as lame add-ons with the sole purpose of jacking up the price. Then I saw the Nuvi 200. The most basic of basic Garmin GPS units. I kept dragging my feet on purchasing one because I was afraid I'd make the wrong choice and regret it. Last week, I received as a gift from a friend. I'm very happy with it. It's small, sleek, with a bright screen. The vehicle mount is tiny, but the suction cup is extremely strong and it definitely holds it in place. I've been using it for fun so far just to see how it works. Granted, there are a few flaws with it. For starters, my Garmin doesn't always pick the most efficient route. While driving to the airport, it kept insisting I take interstate when the expressway I was on would've taken me there in almost half the time. On my way back home from dinner, it wanted me to pretty much drive around town to get back to my apartment when the road I was already on would get me home with two quick left turns. Also, there are no external controls except for the on/off/hold switch, so if you need to change the volume, you'll have to go through a few screenshots. My biggest complaint is that the keyboard is arranged alphabetically instead of QWERTY. I don't understand why'd they do that.. Lastly, it doesn't come with add-ons you'd think would be included such as a wall AC adaptor, a USB cable for your computer, and a case. All that was included in the package was the unit itself, the vehicle mount, and DC adaptor. However, it's an acurrate device and is exactly what i was looking for in a GPS device. It's perfect for a first-time GPS user. It's ready to go out of the box; no need to install anything, just turn it on and go. It's the perfect size for tossing into my purse when I leave my car. It has an auto-complete function when entering street names which is cool for when you're spelling out a long name. I personally love the way it quickly recalculates routes for when you miss a turn. All in all, a great gadget for your car.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very user friendly. Very accurate.. 
Cons:. Price could come down a little, though. 
Summary:. I am a first time buyer of a GPS and I find the Garmin 200 to be outstanding. I tried the Magellan and Tom Tom and was very disappointed. The Garmin 200 outdoes the competition. 

$$;
Pros:. I have had my GPS for three years now and I love it. Don't want to leave home without it.. 
Cons:. Nothing for now.. 
Summary:. I enjoy the way it helps me get to point A and to point B. I have no nothing negative to say.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love it. touch screen very very easy to navigate. un hook it and take it with you GREAT.. 
Cons:. my only problem with this and it not a big problem, i put my address in and it put me .04 miles from my house, so it wasnt dead on but real close, and it does need a coiled cord. 
Summary:. these people that are complaining on here about this product obviasly did not do much reserch on itwhat do you expected for 129 dallors ya they have them out their for more money its all in what you want with a gps system. Me personaly i bought it to get from point a to point b and it does that and more. Know that said if your looking for an mps player,talk to you,wipe your a** its not for you ..i love it. 

$$;
Pros:. EASY, QUICK, USER FRIENDLY, Best for first GPS, Sleek design. 
Cons:. none as of now. 
Summary:. I have been using this GPS for about a month, and I simply love it. This is my first GPS. I am a student and did not want anything too expensive, but at the same time I wanted to get something that was GOOD. This fits both criteria of being cheap and GOOD.. I totally love and would recommend this to all, specially if this is your first GPS.. 

$$;
Pros:. Free map update 2009, size, color, voice commands. 
Cons:. Can't locate a POI location if name is misspelled.. 
Summary:. Purchased yesterday for a great price $149.00. Worth it so far. I did get the free map 2009 update from Garmin.com. Unit works fast and is street accurate. Some POI are wrong or missing. Very satisifed so far with the unit. Does have favorites option and diffrent views. Bottom line: A solid unit for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. User friendly, light , nice screen, good features. 
Cons:. Not as loaded with extras as more expensive GPS systems. 
Summary:. I started my quest for a GPS system with the TomTom one 3rd edition. This is the comparable model for Garmin. This GPS system worked right out of the box with great ease. After using the tomtom (and returning two for being worthless and breaking within a week) I can say that this GPS is hands down better for a low end GPS system. It comes loaded with recent US maps, but you need to buy others (Alaska Canada Europe ect) Thats fine with me, when I go to Europe Ill buy a map, right now I just needed the US ones any way.. It also has up to date POI (points of interest) such as lodging , food, bars, entertainment venues ect something that the TomTom doesnt really have. (it sais it does but they are limited to the point of frustration). I cant begin to explain the user friendly program in comparison to the TomTom. It is easy to enter addresses and search for places, and easy to save them. It works accurate too. I have had my GPS for a few weeks now and used it on a few trips and I have no complaints.. It doesnt offer online upgrades though like tomtom but thats ok you can still purchase the SD map cards and other applications for it in much the same way. It didnt come with a home charger which I found odd but thats ok, it has the car charger and you can purchase the home charger for a decent price.. All in all if this is the price range you are looking at you cant beat this GPS. I got mine at WalMart for 150 dollars. Please if you are considering a GPS device and are torn between this and the TomTom, give this one a shot, you will be happy I promise. Also Garmin customer support is easy to deal with and contact, TomTom is UK based and transversely nearly impossible to get ahold of via their web site. I sent in a request for help after not seeing a US number to call, and received a generic pre written email reply that said nothing remotely associated to my question.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact size and ease of use. 
Cons:. No case, can only be charged via the car outlet adapter. 
Summary:. Got this for my wife as I was sick of her calling me for directions. It works great and I like the compact size. Great for use in a unfamiliar city if you're on foot also.. Good screen in bright light.. Autofill feature works well.. Quick route recalculation.. All in all a great system for the price.. 

$$;
Pros:. accurate navigation. 
Cons:. doesn't give street names. 
Summary:. a good buy for the money. Not perfect, but it's great anywhere you go, when we travel,we can get phone numbers in the local area. works great.. 

$$;
Pros:. Accurate mapping and dead on time estimates. 
Cons:. Doesn't have voice to text. 
Summary:. If you are budget concious, don't be afraid to buy this unit. The lower price does not mean it is a cheaply made device. Its a great little traveler. No more Mapquest for me!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy instructions, easy to operate.. 
Cons:. A little pricy, but affordable. 

$$;
Pros:. accuracy. 
Cons:. features lack. 
Summary:. Great product to get you from point A to B. Been pretty accurate for me around my town. It does not know about right turns only at a light. Does re calculate pretty quickly. Wish you could reverse route but you need to input your destination every time - unless I am missing where this can be done. What about satalite maps as a map choice? I seen more expensive ones carry that but should be included in the core reqirements of a GPS. Live traffic option would be nice also. But that is an option. This is a low end, get you to where you need to go GPS and does that well. Just missing a couple things I would of liked to see in this price range.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use right out of the box!. 
Cons:. Maps and POI could use updating. 
Summary:. After shopping for several months, I decided on the Garmin Nuvi 200. After a demo of the high-end Magellan devices (with voice recognition), I opted for this unit due to the bang-for-the-buck, paying less than $200.00 for this model. Setup and installation were a breeze! Very intuitive commands, good screen visibility even in the highest light conditions. Maps and POI information are very good, but IMO could stand to be updated on this model. Some locations and secondary roads/streets which I felt would be included are missing. Otherwise, the unit functions as advertised with clear, concise instructions and easy-to-read maps and POI database.. Bottom line: if you are interested in basic GPS technology (especially if you are new to the GPS scene) I strongly recommend the Garmin Nuvi 200. You will not be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. Very easy to use and a great value. 
Cons:. None for me though routing is occasionaly less than ideal.. 
Summary:. This unit is really easy to use and carry around. Just plug in the charger and stick the mount to the window of your rental car and find anything or place you need. I travel all over the country for the kid's sporting events and end up needing to find restaurants and all the stuff they forget to pack or that gets lost. I can easily set up a route that hits the coffee place, a grocery store and a pharmacy and not have to worry about getting there and back to the hotel. While the routing is not always the ideal route, it always gets me there. If you want to spend more, you can get better routing and more features. I am thrilled with the value ($200) and utility. It made a long weekend in San Diego seem like I was at home. No buying maps or bad directions from the locals. This is one the best purchases I have made.. 

$$;
Pros:. best buy ever. 
Cons:. none at this time. 
Summary:. This device is a great road companion,makes getting to places a lot easier,should have purchased one a long time ago. Bigg Will. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy-to-use; plug in and go; quick start-up; clear screen; xlnt reputation of circuitry/software; small &#38; lightweight. 
Cons:. Car plug does not fit cigarette lighter socket; car plug shld be coiled; no case included; newest version of map software not included; no text-to-speech; no AC plug included. 
Summary:. I just bought the Nuvi 200 a few days ago, and though I've only used it a few times, I've found its performance to be excellent. Just plug it in and go. Picks up satellite signals in seconds. Screen is clear even in sunlight. Software -- so far -- has proven accurate and well-thought out, though it is not Garmin's newest version (it's version 7 instead of 8). The unit itself is small and lightweight and is therefore easily stowed in a briefcase or even a jacket pocket. I purchased it at Buydig.com for $239, wch is a good deal compared w/ the price of some of Garmin's other products (the Nuvi 350, f'rinstance). Downsides: the cigarette lighter plug that is included does not fit my vehicle (a Saab 900)! Very annoying. I thought cigarette lighter plugs were standardized? I contacted Garmin about this, but no response yet. The plug does not "click" into the socket and just pops out, forcing me to hold it in, wch is ridiculous. Also, the plug itself should be coiled, not straight. Garmin "cheaped out" on that one. Also, it does not include an AC plug. For the $, the AC plug should be included, as should a vinyl case to hold the unit. Both are penny-pinching oversights that are annoying. Overall, it looks like an excellent product, though the above oversights shld be addressed by Garmin -- even if they add a few dollars to the purchase price.. 

$$;
Pros:. low online price, compact size. 
Cons:. no ac adapter included. 
Summary:. As a first time NAV buyer and user, I wanted the reputation and reliablity of the Garmin brand. I knew that I would only use the NAV occasionally for trips to unknown cities, so this was perfect as I didn't need the extra bells and whistles and didn't want to spend too much. The NAV was up and running right out of the box, and never again will I shamefully stop at a gas station to ask for directions!. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, great price, bright screen, loud voice prompts. 
Cons:. POI (points of interest) not very extensive. 
Summary:. I bought this for my mom for mother's day, and tested it out before I gave it to her. I was extremely pleased with the unit. It has very clear voice prompts while driving, great 3D map display with arrows at turns, and recalculates the route quickly if you take a wrong turn. My main complaint is with the POI database. It is slow (b/c of the processor) and did not even have any of the Ben and Jerry's in Charlotte, NC nor a main church. My mom who still struggles with programming her home phone quickly picked it up with a 10 minute lesson. The photo viewer is a nice touch. I highly recommend this for entry level users. Higher models will get you text to speech for street names, and faster processors.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, Size, Accuracy. 
Cons:. sometimes it takes a while for it to connect but it always does and i have never lost signal once it was acquired.. 
Summary:. great product for anyone who wants a simple gps device to get them from a to b. nothing too fancy but there ar points of interest, conversion calculators, picture viewer, and a few other features to make this a really nice investment for someone who does a lot of driving or maybe for someone who drives as part of their job and then you can write off the purchase...lol. bottom line is that this is nice...maybe not as nice as some of its more expensive counterparts but it does its job well.. 

$$;
Pros:. Finds most locations with ease. Battery life. Great color display and easy to read and hear directions.. 
Cons:. Key pad is a little slow. Not pin point on locations. Unable to rerurn to city and select a street address.. 
Summary:. I have this GPS for work. I am a Paramedic and use map books as well as the GPS to find hose locations. Usually not a problem , especially when I'm trying to find a residence out of our county, deep in the woods. However, sometimes directions are confusing, key pad can sometimes be slow to respond. Usually off by a street or so, which in my line of work, seconds matter. Unable to go back in the memory to the city Ive been in and select a street. Tom Tom has this option and Ive used both. Will purchase a Tom Tom for work. Better directions.. 

$$;
Pros:. Size, speed, and Sound. 
Cons:. SLOW map update, no TTS, Access to support. 
Summary:. This is a great lil gps, it comes ready right out of the box. It's basic, has no text-to-speech, and does some quirky things with mapping, (I used it to go to my home as a test from three blocks away, it had me travel away, round a block, then head back to my house.. weird).. Anyway, it supports SD and does exactly what it is supposed to do. Walmart has this thing on sale right now and I couldn't pass it up. It also has a free update to 2009 Map Until July 2008 but beware.. This process can take FOREVER (2-3 hours) and in my case I had to tether the device, delete content (non-English voice files, included jpegs, and vehicle images) to get the necessary additional 32 mb needed for the update. I also deleted my old map image file upon the recommendation of several wikis. Once I did that, I was able the 2 Gb file I'd downloaded from Garmin and update to the latest maps. DEFINITELY register first thing on Garmin if you buy this device and download the Web Updater and see if you qualify for the map update.. In closing, I'd say this gps is best for minimalists like me, it does what it is supposed to do, and after comparing it to the TomTom One 3rd edition, the voice is much louder and distinctive. I would have rated it higher if the update process hadn't gone so klunky.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, keeps you from getting lost most times. 
Cons:. slow to get signal, wrong addresses in database. 
Summary:. I picked up one of these on sale for 169.99 at best buy. I thought, how could I lose at such a price? Well, I still believe you get what you pay for, but this has proven to be worth it for the most part.. The menu is very easy to use and intuitive. I only wish it had some more customization and that you could adjust the volume of the voice commands which doesn't seem to be working. On occasion, it has led me on wild goose chases such as to a Best Buy that did not exist. It also is keen on long, unnecessary detours that had I not known better would have taken me quite out of my way. But that is the way it wanted to go and when I went those same routes with different settings, it wanted the same routes again. They are ridiculously long and would waste a lot of time. I have cursed this thing a few times.. That said, 90% of the time brings exactly what I wanted...directions to where I want to go and an easy way back home. For the money I spent, it can't be beat but you could spend more and get a more customizable, faster, and more intelligent GPS. But if you don't need a lot of frills, go with this one.. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice big screen. 
Cons:. not vocal street"s names. 
Summary:. I have this gps since last dicember, this is my second gps, and i think this is much better then the pioneer i had before, bigger screen and more easy to use. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy menus, Compact size, Internal battery. 
Cons:. Can have a hard time when streets are very close together, Distance to turn prompts are a little off.. 
Summary:. My last GPS was a Magellan that was so old you had to upload sections of map from your desktop computer and didn't have enough memory for 3 states, but it was so accurate when I zoomed in it could tell which lane I was in if I was on a highway! I decided to try Garmin because Magellan quit offering updated maps. The Nuvi has all the map detail preloaded for the US so its ready to go out of the box, but its not as precise as my old Magellan. If streets are very close together or if your in a parking lot it will try to place you on a parallel street. The menus are super easy to use and you probably won't need the manual to get up and running. The picture viewer and other bells and whistles all work great but I use my phone for those types of things.. BOTTOM LINE - Get this one if your on a tight budget or just need a GPS a couple of times a year for vacation or something like that. Its not the best out there but, for the money it will get you where you want to go just fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. Fast start up, simple interface. 
Cons:. Not pinpoint on location; especially when in pedestrian mode.. 
Summary:. This is my first GPS unit, and I purchased it on Black Friday at Best Buy. I initially planned on buying the TomTom One LE, but after a quick chat with the salesman I was drawn to the Garmin which, he said, is a better unit and worth the $50 increase in price.. I live in the East Bay of the SF Bay Area, and decided to test it out on a day trip to SF. Going there I had no problems, with the exception of after coming out of the Caldecott Tunnel (because it lost signal), it recalculated my location as the side street next to the freeway and therefore popped up with all these directions to get to the on-ramp. After driving a few minutes it realized where I was and correctly calculated the route.. While in the city, I tried out the pedestrian mode, and was greatly disappointed. It couldn't figure out where I was (but was in the right vicinity) and as I walked in the Richmond district it didn't correctly move the way I was moving. Perhaps because a pedestrian moves considerably slower than a car? I don't know. But I really won't use it for walking around.. Driving home was the worst. While I drove on the freeway, it kept telling me I was on the adjacent streets, and also estimated my time of arrival as 11 hours later. At this point I told myself I was going to return the unit because 1) mine is defective or 2) the unit's dumb. However I was the dumb one because I realized I still had it on pedestrian mode. Few quick taps on the screen and I had it back to driving mode where everything was aok.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good coverage of the USA. 
Cons:. Wish it could have been purchased with the USA and Canada installed.. Has to keep recalabrating.. 
Summary:. Good price, Very good at locating Restaurants and other places.. If I was to purchase again I'd go with a Tom Tom it has the USA and Canada installed when purchased.. 

$$;
Pros:. small, convienent. 
Cons:. needs updated maps. 
Summary:. many,many calls and emails to customer service/tech support -unable to download map online. they responded in a timely fashion, only not with an answer. good product-needs better software support. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, good extras. 
Cons:. Price not competitive compared to TomTom, PPC. 
Summary:. I have tested two of those, bought by friends, one of them is still very happy with it, the other returned it.. In my opinion it is easy to use, far better than many higher priced in-car older generation products that are inferior in all respects except for the screen (larger).. The trouble is that as a car/city gps device, TomTom products are even better.. It's beyond me that CNet is giving this 400$ device the same rating as TomTom One that can be had for 300$.. For non-waterproof devices, the best deals are cheap PocketPCs gps bundles that can be had for a couple of hundred dollars.. Or a Nokia phone with gps (free software from Nokia).. 

$$;
Pros:. This product does it job of directing you where to go efficiently. Interface is fairly easy to use. I was able to figure out how to use the product with out reading the manual (this to me is the test of a good design).. 
Cons:. The product takes FOREVER sometimes to find a signal. I have tried to figure out tricks to make acquiring a signal more efficient, but so far no luck. I have found myself sitting in my car for 10-15 min waiting for my route to calculate.. 
Summary:. If you are looking for an easy to use GPS, then this system works well. Be prepared to sit and wait awhile for a signal.. 

$$;
Pros:. Price, value, Just GPS and Photo viewer.. 
Cons:. After the 1 year warranty stopped working, thought it might be battery. Opened unit found missing capacitor and GPS chip getting hot. OK if you want cheap GPS, not as good as the nuvi 350.. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, very quick on reroute, good sat. tracking, touch screen works very easy sensitive to touch. nice long battery life. 
Cons:. doesn't change display to night mode automaticly, not very accurate maybe 500 feet,. maps not updated out of box. hard to update maps. 
Summary:. traded mine in after one week.would tell me I had arrived while I still had two turns to make. gave me address on wrong side of street.screen hard to see in daylight too bright at night without resetting display every change in light. No ac adapter. 

$$;
Pros:. At first, it was highly accurate and seemed almost to 'adaapt' to my preferrential routes. It saved my bacon several times once I realized I was in the wrong area for a very white, blue-eyed Welsh [100%] decendant.. 
Cons:. Sadly, after 2 years, it's accuracy sucks and lately has trouble locking onto a satelite.. 
Summary:. do not buy if not current [08] mapping installed with guarantees of free assistance to update or it updates itself somehow [perhaps by daily accum. of signals from satelite. A glad to mad unit.From San Diego to Disneyland, at nite,8-'08, it took me to 'downtown' L.A.! Missed grandkids big disney night trying to find our hotel 1/2 milefrom front gates disneyland. I can't get it to update and ready to throw $400 unit away.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small sleek design. 
Cons:. Satellite connection is an issue. 
Summary:. I would think twice before buying another Garmin product. I have returned my NUVI200W twice because it fails to acquire a satellite connection. It may take as long as 45 min. to acquire a signal, sometimes never.. Soon I will be on my third unit. I hope it perform flawlessly. Out of all the options and functions a GPS devise has no matter what brand, satellite reception should not be an issue, otherwise the device is useless.. 

$$;
Pros:. somewhat accurate. 
Cons:. not completely accurate. 
Summary:. I followed directions using this one getting home from work one morning. I knew the route well, but decided to follow the Nuvi directions exactly. I got taken on a trip three times longer than it needed to be, through back roads when there was an interstate highway that would take me directly home. All in all , this device took me on a on and a half hour trip that should have taken me thirty minutes. I am not satisfied. But sinse this is my first device I am not sure if all systems have these problems. I am not so sure I need a GPS system anymore. I might do better without it.. 

$$;
Pros:. it's a gps system.. 
Cons:. very few features, poor route calculation and limited map. 
Summary:. Bought this mostly for my mother who has trouble reading maps. We calculated the 6-hour trip from CT to my apartment in DC and the results were disappointing. The system did not read my apartment address on Mass Ave NW, rather it showed only Mass Ave NE (which does not exist) and on confirmation gives Mass Ave SE, one of the two Mass Aves in Washington. While this is only one example in an admittedly confusing city, it is a disappointment nonetheless. Furthermore, after selecting an address near my apartment, the route calculated was quite poor. I don't how the points of interest stack up to other gps systems but that would be the only bright spot of this system. One caveat: this reviewer is biased in favor of just reading a good ol' fashioned map.. 

$$;
Pros:. Small, quick, and very easy to use. 
Cons:. The system automatically locks up and deletes all data if you do not install the updates !!!!!!!!!!. 
Summary:. Love the unit, but Garmin does not supply the USB chord for updates, and the fact that it deletes all files and will not operate if you do not purchase the $80.00 upgrade after two years is horrible. I would NOT purchase another Garmin product. The support is even very poor !. 

$$;
Pros:. looks/size. 
Cons:. Crapy GPS chip and no WAAS. 
Summary:. Garmin more or less came out with the Nuvi line to lower cost to sell more units. However, they did this buy downgrading it's core gps components.. Their old low end (price) GPS units use to have good gps chips and were WAAS enabled. Not anymore, they discontinued their older low end units came out with Nuvi and removed WAAS and downgraded the gps chip.. If your looking for a Nuvi with the good core components look towards the high end Nuvi's. They'll have it.. Currently, summer 2008, after some research, the Garmin C550 is a really great GPS for under $200 now. I would highly recommend the Garmin C550 over the low end Nuvi's.. 

$$;
Pros:. Great features and good directions (when it works). 
Cons:. Always difficulties in picking up a satellite signal.. 
Summary:. Finally returned it after 4 months. Wanted very badly to keep it but just got really fed up after a trip to PA.. I accepted the fact that it took 15-20 mins to pick up a signal (I would turn the device on a half hour earlier)but when I need it most (on a road trip with the family), it couldn't pick up a signal for nearly 2 hours. What a piece of junk!!. 

$$;
Pros:. It is a GPS &#38; it will be a great tool in the Future, just not yet.. 
Cons:. Their are many faults the main one is that the routes are NOT good.. 
Summary:. I have been using mine since Dec07 and honestly I hate to even use it anymore because I just can NOT TRUST the routes it picks. I feel bad because it was a gift &#38; I wanted to like it, but it's so bad it has prompted me in writing this review. Seriously my advice is to wait a couple of generations.. 

$$;
Pros:. Compact; user friendly. 
Cons:. Kept losing satellite signal. 
Summary:. We were initially very excited to use this GPS device. However, we were very unhappy with its habitually poor signal reception. Sometimes it wouldn't pick up the satellite connection until we were almost at our destination! While this may have been due to the overcast weather we have been experiencing, it is of little use to have a device that only works in sunny weather. Maybe this one was just a lemon; we're going to try either exchanging it for a replacement, or trying a different make of auto GPS device.. 

$$;
Pros:. The software is very user friendly. Easy to navigate through the menus.. 
Cons:. The new maps take forever to upload. Once loaded the Directions it gives you on a trip are way off. The unit tried 4 times to send me up on ramp off the interstate. Also many other time trying to take me onto on coming traffic.. 
Summary:. From my experience i would never buy this unit again. The First one i got died in two days i got it replaced and then had all the issues listed above. Now i have used the better models and they seemed to work great so i know it is not Garmin. They probably cut to many corners to make it affordable.. 

$$;
Pros:. bought the Garmin a year ago. it worked great for the first year only.. 
Cons:. after first year, Garmin started acting up - wrong directions, couldn't find streets, wrong mileage to destination, etc. Problems began exactly when new map updates were available - at an outrageous fee!. 
Summary:. don't buy Garmin unless you want to pay outrageous annual fees for map updates. and suspiciously, Garmin begins to malfunction IF you don't buy map updates. that is so wrong.. 

$$;
Pros:. Economical and easy to use. 
Cons:. Their customer Service department is a joke !. 
Summary:. I bought the unit 12/24/08. On 3/21/09 it just stopped working. When I got back from vacation I called the number on the extended warranty plan. It doesn't take effect until after the Manufactures warranty expires ( 40 minutes on hold with various people). All I got for the extra money was a phone number to Garmin. Soooooo I called them. ANOTHER 40 minute wait to talk to somebody. At least they spoke english. So here I am an Hour and a 1/2 later and still no solution. The lady was quite nice and explained that the "Car charger" is a trickle charger and sometimes doesn't quite fully charge the unit. Great,,, a portable unit that doesn't work with the charger provided. She wanted me to dig around and see if I had an old USB cable that would fit the unit. HUH ??? I informed her that it was ALWAYS plugged into the car charger 24/7 on a dedicated cigarette lighter that was always turned on. I had "Hard wired" the little bugger myself so it was constantly on. Wellllllllll She told me that there was nothing she could do for me. So it was off to speak to a supervisor. He "bent the rules" by asking me to return it to them. I get to pay the freight ( Yipeeee ) Box it myself ( Yipeee ) take it to the UPS store ( Oh yeah ! ) And WHEN they get it they will ship out a refurbished unit in 12 to 15 business days. Now, I"m an outside sales person with a customer service department. If I were to tell a customer they had to jump through all of those hoops to return a clearly defective product I would be lynched. Or at best they would lock the door behind me and hid the wife and kids when I showed my face to sell them something again. The unit is a great little device. But its sad when a company doesn't stand behind their product and darn near "Challenges you" to do business with them.. I loved the unit,,,, but their customer service policys are totally UNDERWHELMING !!!. 

$$;
Pros:. good POI's, expensive. 
Cons:. see opinion- too many to fit into this space. 
Summary:. Never knew where I was, constantly "recalculating" no matter where I was. Everytime I stopped at a red light it thought I was on a parallel steet and it would recalculate and I wouldn't know where I was going! It showed my car icon spin in a circle-obviously something is wrong.. It led me to a dead end residential road that said it was a 'jewlery store' and wasted my gas on more than 10 occasions when it would tell me one way and then change the route and I would have to scramble in the car to find where I was! I would get off on wrong highways, only to turn me around again! So frustrating. If I only had all that gas money back.. You can't avoid a certain route or street, either, and it won't re-route you when you run into traffic like magellan will. Also, magellan will let you avoid a certain road.. I tried updating it twice online, even called in and they told me it was the best download...well it didn't help a bit.. Also, on the display screen magellan will show you the street you are on and the street you will turn on. Garmin only shows you the street you need to turn on next. How are you supposed to know where you are when you're in a new spot?. AND the kicker is when it doesn't have satellite reception, which is all the time, you don't know what your next turn will be-you have to try to rememeber what it was. When magellan knows you're lost it will keep on the screen the steps you need to take until it finds you again.. I had this for about 6 months and time and time again after wanting to chuck it out the window and run over it (I just used it on mute bc I was sick of it saying "recalculating") I got rid of it and am buying a magellan....it's cheaper anyways with a better satellite network..

Pros:. None, if it won't start, it can't have a pro. 
Cons:. Doesn't work. 
Summary:. I received the Garmin 260 for Christmas in Colorado. The first time I tried to use it was on a trip to Tampa Florida, it could not find a satelite in the 4 days I was there even though my travel companion received a perfect signal on his Blackberry. When I returned to Colorado, Best Buy basically told me that it was too bad that I didn't buy a warranty, because they couldn't help me. They claimed that they did a "factory reset" but wouldn't tell me how since I didn't have a service agreement. If you buy this GPS from Best Buy, make sure you get the service agreement, or buy it from a reputable retailer. I now own a $200 paperweight..

Pros:. Inexpensive, good customer service. 
Cons:. Cannot lock onto satellites, very slow searches. 
Summary:. My first unit was incapable of locking onto a satellite signal. I brought it back and got a second one. Nearly the same problem, but not quite as bad. It routinely takes several minutes to get a signal, which is useless when I want to get in the car and drive. Performing searches results in a spinning hourglass for long periods of time.. Garmin worked with me on the phone and we did a firmware patch. I hit the reset button, per Garmin's instructions, which did nothing. In my opinion this unit is not capable of performing its intended function. Sorely disappointed in this unit - what a waste of money..

Pros:. size, ease of use. 
Cons:. slow operation, out-of-date maps. 
Summary:. Just got the newest map update (2009 North America) and the maps still did not include most of the streets and addresses in my new hometown area (Fernley NV) even though the homes and addresses have been there for over 5-10 years. Small suburban cities just aren't supported very well. Places,,, Hotels, restaurants, sports stadiums are not well supported either, Would not recommend this product! Customer suuport, BTW, is TERRIBLE!. 

$$;
Pros:. None except Cheap. 
Cons:. Ridiculous map update policy. 
Summary:. Garmin refuse to give free map update even if you buy any unit 1 day before the latest map release date or discountinued item. Beware..
