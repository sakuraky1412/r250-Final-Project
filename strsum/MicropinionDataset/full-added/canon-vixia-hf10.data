excellent value  .
extreme high quality , i cant wait to take this hd cam on my next cruise vacation  .
updated  .
on aug 16 , 2009  .
i wanted a camera that could take some abuse of my family vacations and it has held up really well from the dessert to the snow and disney world in between  .
i purchased it with the extened battery and charger as well as two 8gb and one 16gb flash  .
this combination has been great  .
along with the built in 16gb of flash i have never run into power or storage problems  .
have used it from 7 am early entrance at disney hollywodd studios to the midnight fantasmic show  .
i used it as much as i wanted and never came close to having a problem  .
it is smart enough to know when it has been left on and will shut down by itself  .
i would also recommend purchasing a good video editng suite like vegas or pinnacle that can handle the avchd format  .
nero 8 and higher does it as well for simple edits  .
the video quality is great  .
it looks fine in bright lite and pretty good in low light  .
it does not have night vision but that is okay i am not a stalker  .
surprisngly the stll camera shots look outstanding even though they are only at ~3  .
2 megapixels  .
i have a highly rated 9mp sony point and shoot and they are comparible in quality of picture  .
the cannon has much less visual noise but the pictures of course arenot as big , i will say stabiliy is difficult to acheive successfully whe hokding in hand as it is small  .
for a steadier shot i would use a tri or mono pod  .
i is bale to get some beautiful belagio fountain videos in vegas  .
i would have to say that this camera is my wifes favorite gadget i have ever purchased it and it is simple enough for her to use  .
she prefers it over our still camera for family events and holidays  .
i could not recomend this camera more  .
there may be a few quarky things that people don't like but if you have a lot of gadgets you get used to it and it does not bother you  .
the only one i can think of is switching from video to still mode to take a picture  .
great buy and it is even better now it has been out a while  .
i bought mine the first day ii is on store shelves .
i recommend it to everyone who wants to broadcast high definition video live online  .
i took the canon vixia hf 10 on a trek in the himalayas for a month and it worked exceptionally well  .
since i could buy no extra supplies along the way and even electricity is seldom available i brought a total of 64 gb memory plus the larger battery  .
the results were a camera that delivered great quality pictures with enough memory and battery life to last a prolonged period of time  .
the small size of the camera allowed me to easily carry it in my backpack or even in a pocket  .
so , i'd recommend the camera for 'off the beaten path' activities  .
if canon would include decent software for editing the video , this would be an all    around winner of a camera updated  .
on jan 15 , 2009  .
i don't have experience with other video cameras regarding features or ease of use , but i'm quite demanding regarding pic quality as a serious amateur still photographer  .
i'd say do not hesitate to get this camera because all of the above have met or exceeded my hopes  .
i felt like i is taking a bit of a chance buying after reading some rather negative reviews along with a lot of good ones  .
suffice to say i'm ecstatic at this point  .
works great with a mac (i switched quite recently from windows with no regrets)  .
dvd burned for friends looks just fine on good quality plasma tv and the process on the mac works just fine with idvd for real quick and dirty , imovie '08 for a bit more control and final cut express for anything i'll ever need  .
stabilization is good but monopod or tripod use where you can would be a good idea    especially if you use the zoom a lot .
would have given this a 10 plus if it had a view finder , but then i guess that would take more parts and space  .
did a lot of research before i replaced my expired sony tr 350    it died after 6 years    a mechanical failure    too expensive to repair    so i went on the hunt  .
this camera does the avchd codec    i process this with ulead video studio and output to an ordinary dvd  .
played the dvd in a panasonic dmp    bd30k in an electronics store and those viewing were really impressed as is i  .
the hf10 has enough memory to capture more than 5 hrs without going to sd card  .
more than enough for anything i will ever need it for  .
sdhc cards are getting cheaper everyday    i got an 8 gig at frys for $29  .
will also get a 819 battery for back up  .
oh , don't forget to buy a nice sturdy monopod for this camera as it is a light weight  .
your videos will look like a pro shot them  .
i do not think you can beat this little jewel for the price and the quality .
overall , this camera is great  .
the quality and clarity of the video is great  .
since the camera uses flash video , the size and weight of the camera are amazingly small and light software could definetly be better  .
at times the video can be choppy , but i suggest to upgrade the software with the latest service pack or patch  .
the battery that is included with the camera is unappealing since it only tends to last about an hour  .
you may want to get bp819 battery .
great camera overall  .
the design is quite intuitive , and the quality is fantastic .
love the picture  .
love using sd cards  .
cannot record to internal and external flash at the same time may not be a big deal to most users  .
still new to this camera so have not tried 24p/30p modes  .
thought lack of a firewire port would be problematic but runs fine on usb2  .
0 did not waste my time on bundled software  .
fce log and transfer feature works fine , but will crash once in a while edius will edit avchd files converted to  .
avi (conversion software provided by edius)  .
i bought this camera to replace my 7    year old minidv camera that eats tapes  .
16gb of internal flash memory is great    about 2 hours of 1080p video  .
i only really record family video in chunks of 30    45 minutes anyway  .
i may go the full 2 hours at a time when my new baby arrives in a month video quality is superb  .
saves as m2ts , uses h  .
264  .
the software is intuitive  .
you don't need much instruction to figure it out  .
i just use it to view and download the video to my pc  .
the viewer is great  .
i don't know what it does , but it allows me to view the video seemlessly while mp classic and vlc cannot , even with the most updated codecs  .
(my pc generally has a hard time with 1080p , but freezes completely when i try to play video fromthis camera)  .
downloading the video is easy  .
i'm not concerned with editing my video yet , so i cannot give any review on that  .
i'm just archiving it for when i get a more powerful pc the size is great  .
decent size lcd screen and the thumb toggle stick is not really a nuissance cons  .
the wind filter is not great  .
there is no viewfinder  .
you have to record with the lcd open  .
that takes more life fromthe battery  .
i haven't had a new camer in 7 years , so i do not know if this is standard or not these days .
i bought this because i need to record family events  .
it is refurbished off of newegg , but you would never know it  .
out of the box the hf10 is ready to record , although for only a few minutes to play before charging  .
battery life is fair , but i will be investing in an extra pack for when i'm out more than 2 hours the easy recording mode is great for point and shoot action in most any situation  .
there are multiple other options that i like to play with to get different effects , but you have to plan the shots the only issue i have is recording in low light , and i have found most camcorders have issues with that unless you pay the extra cash for it  .
it gets a little grainy and the frame rate is slightly choppy  .
the flash is a little much for photos sometimes , and there is little information on adjusting it  .
the optional light does not do much for video recording , and adds a blue hue to close ups because of the led used for the light overall , for basic recording in high def the hf10 is fairly easy to use and gets really good video quality  .
if you need something to record more than family and friends stuff , you might go with a higher and more expensive model if i had the extra cash i would have gone with the sf line  .
for $399 , even for a refurbished camera this one is very , very nice  .
i already have family and friends drooling over it .
i love this camcorder  .
it is a top performed in my opinion , especially for a price tag under $600 including a carrying case at costco  .
great bargain the video quality is very good  .
it is as sharp as you could possibly expect for the small footprint of the camera and the low sticker price  .
for home movies , i couldn't really ask for anything more  .
make absolutely sure your shooter has a steady hand though , because the more the camera moves the more artifacts and glitchy digitalisms you'll see in your video (a product of the avchd file architecture which i don't have time to go into here)  .
in any case , i'm very pleased with the video quality  .
sound quality is good , though subjects are hard to hear in noisy environments  .
this complaint , however , is about how microphones work in general , not this particular camcorder if you're like me    a geek looking to do every geeky thing with every gadget he has    you're going to be very interested in editing your video  .
this is where the camera gets more tricky because of its video format (the following should hold true of all camcorders recording in avchd)  .
you cannot edit avchd natively on mac  .
i'm using final cut express and it first must be converted to either prores or aic format before editing can take place  .
this conversion drastically inflates the size of your files  .
your editing size is about 40gb per hour , give or take 10gb depending on the nature of your video  .
therefore , full hd editing requires a fast hard drive , preferably firewire 800 if you can swing it  .
this said , however , my videos come out in outstanding quality and the extra cash to make all of this happen is money well spent i'm a big fan of flash based products in general because , in my experience , having hard drives in particular but moving parts in general is an invitation for unwanted problems  .
so long as your hf10 doesn't experience a long drop or hard impact , it should continue to work for a very long time  .
it uses sdhc cards , which are relatively cheap and take up a lot less space than hdv tapes  .
technical observations   the camera starts quickly , but takes about 5 seconds to think before allowing you to record  .
sound is generally good  .
included battery will only yield 60    70 minutes , but for 125 bucks you can get one that lasts over four hours (if you need it)  .
menu system is easy to use  .
i do not really know my way around manual settings so i cannot comment there  .
the autofocus , however , is amazing all in all , a great camcorder if you want to take the hd plunge  .
i highly recommend this product , especially at the new lower price since this year's model is set to replace it  .
you should , however , do your homework before making this purchase  .
happy shooting .
the vixia hf 10 is the best video camera i've ever owned  .
the controls are easy to use , the screen is clear and crisp , and the sound is clean  .
i'm surprised at the quality for the price  .
i took video at a party that is loaded with florescent lights and i had no noticeable color shift  .
everything looked clean and clear even using the auto focus feature  .
i mean this thing locks in perfectly on the subject matter  .
the new avchd format is wonderful  .
i like the fact that the camera has the option to use a sd card  .
i am also impressed that it takes still shots that i can actually look at without cringing  .
back in december i purchased the sony dcr    sr45 and it is a bad choice for me  .
i ended up giving it to my 13 year old  .
i'm not slamming the sr45 because it is never meant to compete at the hd level  .
it just fell short of my personal expectations  .
canon could have gone cheap with features but they kept the quality factor in  .
they managed to give you an external mic jack and a headphone out  .
this flash based video camera is an excellent value and it delivers exactly what they promised , and more .
bottom line , this camcorder is the best choice if your looking for a $500 camcorder  .
very nice color reproduction , very nice finish , feature packed  .
please purchase the canon mic (dm    100)  .
you will not regret the sound improvement  .
my hand is very shaky and the is really does not work as well as it could but it is not as bad as the sony  .
i compared this camera to the sony cx12 .
high    quality product that deleivers excellent video/audio  .
i love it  .
updated  .
on sep 29 , 2008  .
if you are looking for hd at no compromise , this is da best  .
options about this cam  .
the canon vixia hf10 is simply a great camcorder for taking great looking video wherever you find yourself  .
it's very small and easily be slipped into a large pocket  .
it has a great lens and lots of manual controls , if you're into that  .
i does not have an adjustment wheel or roller for the manual controls , joystick only , but the interface is intuitive and friendly  .
for intel based macintoshes (apple does not support avchd on ppc macs) , you probably already have what you need to edit the footage from this camera  .
imovie '08 will import the footage and convert it to apple intermediate codec so you can edit the footage on the timeline and make quicktime movies to share on the  .
mac web gallery , youtube , appletv (720p24 even) etc  .
the newest versions of final cut express and final cut pro (pro res 422) also supports avchd  .
pc options are more limited and not as elegant , but they are out there , by all means avoid the bundled software  .
the hf10 does not record in sd resolutions , so if you're just looking for a cool youtube camcorder or you're going to be burning your projects to a dvd , you should consider a dv (tape) camcorder or an sd hdd / flash model that records in mpeg    2 , you'll be much happier  .
the 16gb built    in storage is nice , but limited  .
if you're the type of person that likes to shoot video and hook it up to your tv to share and just likes to keep the video on the camcorder , you'll run out of space fast , definitely consider the spacious sony hdr    sr11  .
the unit is expandable via sd hc cards , i would recommend getting the fastest ones you can , the bitrate for the best hd video on this camcorder is 17mbs and you'll need one that can keep up .
an extremely impressive camera both in size and capability  .
the hd clarity is awesome  .
packs a large punch considering how small it is  .
i is however dumbfounded to find that the only way to charge the one battery it comes with is by plugging in the whole camera with battery attached  .
one would think that for nearly $1000 you would also get a independent , wall plug , battery charger  .
once charged , the battery life is a little on the low end  .
i ended up ponying up an additional $300 for needed accesories  .
for example   charger (~$70) , two batteries (~$90 ea) , and a couple sdhc memmory cards (~$50 for 8gb and $80 for 16 gb)  .
i would certainly do again , all things considered , because when it comes to hd in a small package , you're not going to find much better  .
enjoy  .
this is my first camcorder so i have no basis for comparison  .
the quality of the video has been excellent  .
my only caveat is that the battery life while recording video is only about 80 minuts  .
i wish it were longer  .
otherwise , i do not have any complaints .
i think the cam looks really great but when i've found out it records in mpg4 format  .
does it makes less better than canon's hv20 camcorder  .
like what we know , in mindv it is raw , which makes the quality pure  .
but what do you think about the mpg4 format of hf10  .
does it loses quality  .
(correct me if i'm wrong)  .
the codec it uses which is h  .
264 is really good  .
but what about mpg4  .
does it make any difference  .
wanna hear from some people about this before getting one  .
been deciding whether to get hv20 or hf10 which is better , hv20 or hf10  .
finding software to download the video in 1920 by 1080 has been a hassle  .
the pixela software is crap .
bottom line    .
nice video quality , but quality is reduced when converting  .
m2ts files and making dvd's with bundled software  .
you will need lots of cpu power , ram and good video card to even view video on a pc  .
my first pc meet the requirements (3  .
0 ghz cpu , 2 gb 533 mhz ram etc  .
) to view edit using the bundled software and is still very choppy to view and froze up during edit  .
i have since purchased a quad core 3  .
4 ghz , 8 gb 1333 mhz ram , geforce 9800 gt video card etc , basically a gamming pc  .
this new pc handles the  .
m2ts files well and quickly but still shows some horizontal distortion lines on playback  .
editing works fast with coral video studio pro x3 but again , quality is reduced when producing a dvd  .
when the hf10 is hooked directly up to a tv through the av jacks , picture quality is very good i would not recommend canon vixia hf10 unless you have a very high powered pc and expensive editing software  .
bundled software and corel do not cut it .
there has to be an hd camera on the market with better battery life and a better software package included/ easier way of downloading hd video to pc  .
the imagemixer software is very difficult to use and comes with no documentation  .
not sure what to do with my nice , very large , movies .
the bottom line is canon should not hide this information (interlaced camcorder) from potential buyers on page 121 of their manual , in small print your review makes the same mistake , mentions progressive 30p and 24p modes when both formats are converted by the camera to interlaced 60i right before recording .
incredibly slow in    camera charging at $700 price    point  .
a short battery    life of 60 minutes at best  .
external charger a $70 accessory  .
this is a critical component of any camera , and canon falls way short on battery implementation hd picture quality is nice , form    factor is nice , overall nice camera , with great optics  .
but think twice before about any good deals you find on this because it doesn't include and external charger , battery has to be charged in camera which is incredibly slow and inconvenient  .
luckily they do make an external charger which is faster , but it is expensive  .
take into consideration that this camera has a couple of accessories you will need to get    .
1) extra battery approximately 60 dollars  .
2) external charger approximately 70 dollars  .
3) sdhc memory card approximately 70 dollars  .
so try and get this camera for as low a price as you can and be prepared to add some money to that price  .
not sure what canon is thinking with the battery design on this camera , but it clearly falls short  .
does not last long (60 minutes if you are lucky) , and then charging is incredibly slow and inconvenient in    camera  .
i can understand a battery being an accessory , but the external charged should be included  .
although the camera might be nice , it's quite useless without good power and overall battery implementation , because when it is sitting on the counter    top moonlighting as a charger instead of a camera you might miss that precious moment  .
sorry canon you missed the mark here in a critical area .
liked the camera but when i got my sd chip home and downloaded the avchd files to my pc found the format would not work with my software and when it did the computer coul not handle the avchd file strongly suggest you take an sd chip with you to the store before you buy and make sure the avchd file type works with your pc and editing software  .
good luck  .
we bought the vixia hf10 new in april of 2008 , and took it with us on vacation , where it produced 79 sterling videos  .
after returning home , we continued to use it , and it performed well until just over 100 movies were made  .
then the camera stopped transferring videos to the computer  .
(stills continued to transfer just fine  .
) we returned the camera to the point of purchase , where it would not even mount on their computers  .
(it still mounted on our computer , but would not transfer videos  .
) canon authorized an exchange , which arrived in just over a week  .
but right out of the box the replacement camcorder could not transfer video  .
it still mounted on the computer , and we could review the movie on the computer , but it would not transfer from the camera to the computer  .
again our attempts at archiving failed  .
our computer is a mac pro running os x leopard  .
application is apple's imovie  .
stills were retrieved with iphoto , which never failed  .
(only videos in imovie were unsuccessful , and only after more than a hundred videos had been successfully transferred  .
) sadly two brand    new canon vixia cameras obtained at a big box outlet failed miserably  .
i am almost fanatical about wearing the wrist strap , being careful to not jostle the camera , never leaving it in the sun , and so forth  .
i am 66 years old and have always taken good care of my things , so this is definitely not a case of rough handling , dropping , et cetera  .
for example , i still have and continue to use an older kodak easyshare dx6490 that has never given a bit of trouble  .
unfortunately my confidence in canon cameras has been ruined  .
thanks for reading .
not enough capacity  .
16gb flash is not enough especially when it comes to hd  .
i mean c'mon 2 hours on 16 gb just is not enough  .
i will need heaps of sd cards when travelling  .
hybrid hdd/sd is better value for money when it comes to capacity vs $$$  .
manual focus i found is poor well  .
the jvc gz    hd30/40 i found performed better as far as image quality and colours were concerned .
Fits nicely on a Steadicam Jr.; Pixela sofware. What an embarrasment for such a great camera
the high quality of this excellent HD Camcorder... as well as the all black professional look of this cam; absolutely none
- It can be connected to a Live Streaming Software. - Enables HD Live broadcasting; No Cons found
great camera; what good is it if you cant do anything with the content
Easy easy easy to use, excellent picture, excellent sound; Difficult to achieve steady picture/can't record to internal and external flash at the same time.
Really nice video, good manual settings, great image stabilizer!; AVCHD format limits editing options for Windows users, no eye level viewfinder, no HDMI cable
GREAT CAMERA!; AVCHD format - Needs computer cpu power and software that will work with the video format
Light weight. Very compact. Amazing picture quality. True 1920x1080 recording.; Finding software to edit the files is quite a challenge. No FireWire. Included software requires administrator login to install, which is stupid.
Its very lightweight, battery is pretty good and has good options for both amateurs and professionals; not many cons i found in it yer
Better than average video, small &#38; light; Poor battery life, difficult way of downloading HD video to PC
Very easy to use, great sound, auto focus is very fast and accurate, colors are very vivid and correct compared to Sony. Very light, very quiet, nice looking; Image Stabilization needs improvement. Wide angle needs to be wider.
Video Quality, Good Manual Controls, overall camcorder quality; PC compatibility, software, lower video quality when converting to DVD. Need a high end computer to view, edit videos.
easy to use, petite, and great video quality; must be plugged in to transfer video to a pc
Beautiful videos, great audio... at first.; After just over a hundred videos, the HF10 stopped transferring to the computer. Archiving also failed. Camera was returned to Canon, which deemed it defective, and a replacement was authorized. The replacement failed right out of the box.
Great picture. Great feature set. Very easy to 'master' the camera's basic functions.; The only negative experience I had was that if the camera was pointed anywhere in the vicinity of the sun it adversely affected the resulting video. I found I just had to be a bit on the careful side to avoid this.
Crisp, beautiful, HD video. Lighting &#38; audio always seems just right. Processor performs well &#38; I've never had any issues with recording, navigating, etc. Using 3rd party software, I easily transferred files to PC &#38; burned to HD-DVD or DVD.; Video editing options are still limited and you really have to have a fast computer to manage that process.
Nice finish; Frame rates 30P and 24P (P stands for progressive) are converted to 60i interlaced according to Canon's own support.. All video shows strong signs of interlacing.. The dynamic range is below average.. Manual focusing impossible to use with a joystick.
Sharp video quality, full HD, no moving parts!, records to SD cards, sound quality is good, simple and intuitive.; POOR battery life, AVCHD is quirky, editing your video requires a lot of expensive hardware.
The Vixia HF 10 is the best video camera I've ever owned. The controls are easy to use, the screen is clear and crisp, and the sound is clean. I'm surprised at the quality for the price.; The software is pretty useless. I use Sony Vegas 9.0 for extracting and editing. The junko Image Mixer 3 software that comes bundled in an unfriendly user experience.
Great video quality. Easy to get up and running right out of the box. Small and lightweight.; Battery life is limited. Video software included in not Macintosh compatible.
Took some snow pictures yesterday both before and while the sun was getting low on the horizon. The camera did a fabulous job with a really tough scene!! My first video camera and I'm truly impressed.; The manual focus is disappointing and the windscreen definitely not good enough. Very low light pic is grainy but, apparently, not nearly as bad as a lot of other cameras.
Compact, light and enough features for recording family events. High def recording is great when there is good light. 60i looks great, plus there are options to get a "cinematic" look. Easy mode is cool for no fuss recording in good light.; Low light level recording could be better, as it gets a little grainy in low light and frame rate gets slightly choppy.
nice form-factor, and good HD quality video. Flash memory is great for camcorders; incredibly poor battery life. in-camera charging is totally inconvenient. slow charge time, takes well over an hour to recharge the standard battery. no external charger included, and it is an expensive accessory.
Great picture quality. I can remove the card and stick it straight into my PS3 and am wowed every time. Flash is getting cheaper and is very compact. Conection options are great. Expandable with lenses and mini shoe.; AVCHD format is gaining support. Make sure your video editing suite supports it. I researched this before I bought it so I knew what I was getting into. I would recomend buying an extended battery and external charger. They are very convenient.
