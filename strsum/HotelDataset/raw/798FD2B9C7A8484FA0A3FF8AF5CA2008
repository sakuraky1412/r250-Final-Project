we arrived just before 11 pm having waited 25 minutes for the shuttle , which then took 20 minutes to fight through the heavy traffic .
kudos to the shuttle driver who was extremely helpful , patient with the traffic and chatty .
check in was slow because of the volume of people at the desk .
finally got a room with no bottled water supplied and as we were very dehydrated after a 11 hour flight we tried to buy some from the vending machine on our floor .
that machine was empty so we had to go downstairs to buy some bottled water at $ 3 each plus some lukewarm coffee .
in the meantime we tried to notify our loved ones of our arrival but found out that the internet was $ 13this hotel might be handy for the airport but if our experience was anything to go by expect to pay over $ 30 for incidentals within ten minutes of arriving at the hotel for stuff that is very often free at most other hotels .
there was no non allergenic pillows in the room and we had to wait over twenty minutes for some to be bought up .
we were actually surprised that the hotel did n't charge for that service !
all in all this was a bulk standard 3 star airport hotel which , in our view , took advantage of a captive audience .
the hotel very busy so it must be doing okay .
given the choice i . . .
