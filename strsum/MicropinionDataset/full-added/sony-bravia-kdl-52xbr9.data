bottom line , sony has met the demands again  .
there are many brands to choose from when it comes to hd tv  .
words to the enthusiasts , choose wisely  .
you do get what you pay for  .
i love this sony product  .
exceptional oh , pop in high definition disc (blu    ray) that's another story keep up the good work guys (sony)  .
your product says it all .
people are really impressed of just screenshots i took of the screen with my iphone so i think that says something about the over all quality .
watch the holiday deals  .
picked ours up for under $1600 , and yes it's the xbr model .
wonderful televsion from sony  .
it is not cheap , but i purchased it on sale , so it is well worth for the money i invested  .
looking forward to enjoy it for many years to come .
highly recommended  .
have owned sony tv's for my whole life and have had very few problems  .
purchased this tv from amazon  .
com for $1385 with free shipping during a incredible sony discount weekend they seemed to have  .
very happy with the entire experience picture is not quite as bright as the samsung led , but they use a glossy screen which would have caused major reflection problems for my intended room  .
lg lh90 is outstanding but the price is several hundred dollars higher , though best buy just featured for $1399 with a free blu    ray player .
ever since i had the xbr3 i have been wowed about the quality that these t  .
s give  .
i slowly changed all my t  .
s to xbr's ranging for xbr3 now to xbr9  .
i have to admit samsung has some great t  .
's as well but all my equipment is sony and i love the bravia sync feature  .
the internet are great i like the weather one and the online videos features  .
also after the last update the xbr9 will soon get netflix which i cant for .
my old dvd's are brought to life in a new manner  .
cannot wait to watch lord of the rings again  .
dish sat hd channels are excellent and sd looks very    very good , too the xbr9 series so good , i decided why go with led backlighting and big bucks when the xbr9 is just as good but $1500 less expensive  .
the bravia engine 3 , 10 bit lcd panel and wcg    ccfl lighting brings out stuning contrast the other guys make some decent tv's but they are not a sony  .
i have had this high end tv for 3 weeks now and so far i have nothing but high praises for its outstanding picture  .
this tv made me realize how having deep blacks is very important in displaying hi    def  .
movies come alive because of this  .
skin tones are more natural and edges are really sharp the 5  .
1 speakers is a plus  .
the sound separation is fantastic you will think it's coming from separate speakers  .
it even has an optical output so you can connect it to your home theater system  .
this is very important if you intend to watch internet videos with this tv it's very easy to connect a modem or a bridge to this tv  .
even a gadget challenged individual can do this in one shot , the interactive instructions from the tv is a big help  .
connecting to the internet enables you to watch free movies from cbs , youtube , fear  .
net , sports illustrated on demand , sony pictures , golflink  .
com , and livestrong  .
com for people who are thinking of lifting weights and going on a diet or just healthy eating  .
then there's the amazon video on demand and netflix where you can connect and pay for movies using your own accounts with these companies the only feature that i think it needs an improvement on would be the 240 hz feature  .
i have a regza 120 hz and i do not see any difference on how they handle the blurring effect of fast movements in movies  .
well , maybe i have to play around with the setting a little bit more all in all this is a solid high end tv  .
a little pricey but it's all worth it .
i is able to get the best picture while playing with all of the settings  .
there's a software upgrade once you connect it to the internet that gives you more options and settings  .
the picture is great once you learn how to adjust it to the viewing room angles and lighting using the tvs many settings and menus  .
also , take advantage of the internet options  .
they are worth it .
i picked this tv up on the saturday after thanksgiving for $1900 at best buy and received it about a week and a half later  .
i is considering a it and a 55 samsung led , they didn't have a 52 xbr on display , which is the leap of faith for me  .
i have had numerous sony televisions and haven't been disappointed , which is why the sony won out  .
the xbr9 replaced a s    series sony 40 720p set (moved it to the bedroom)  .
i got it home and used a sanus tilting mount to hang it on the wall  .
i hooked it up with hdmi to my sony es receiver and also used component video  .
i had to use the component video because my cable provider's signal sometimes is not the greatest  .
i purchased a mediabridge hdmi cable thru amazon  .
com , it is a 15' cable for about $19  .
00 delivered  .
i would recommend the cable , great quality with a low price  .
i is up and running in no time  .
i used cnet's posted settings for my cinema settings and watched bolt with the kids  .
it is a standard dvd played on a blu    ray player  .
the details that i could see were amazing  .
i have watched top gun on blu    ray and the first few minutes of gran torino on blu    ray  .
they both looked awesome  .
i have , as well as every other person who has seen it , have been amazed at the picture  .
overall , i have been extremely happy and impressed with the tv now , i will state my only complaint so far  .
i don't like the options for connecting the tv to the internet for streaming vod from amazon , netflix , etc  .
i have to use an ethernet cable and a wireless bridge or a sony bravia internet video link  .
i don't know why i cannot just plug a usb wireless adapter in and go  .
besides , the ethernet cable is one more wire hanging down behind the tv  .
i have considered a powerline adapter setup , but still the wire  .
i know that an ethernet hook up direct from the modem is the most stable signal , a powerline is probably next and wireless is towards the bottom  .
i have a house built in 1935 , so stringing cat5 cable is not an option  .
i know i am whining about it , but i think it should be easier overall , i would recommend this tv in a second , to somebody else  .
i think the led's are great , but i do not really care if my tv is an inch thick or 2 inches thick  .
i also fail to see how the few dollars a year in power savings is going to pay off  .
i understand that (in a perfect world) an led should last forever , but i am willing to risk going with ccfl back lighting  .
i gave the tv a 4  .
5 star rating because of the internet hookup , otherwise it would be a 5 star rating  .
i hope this will help make a buying experience for some people easier .
i bought this tv for one reason    the picture quality  .
it did not fail to deliver  .
i have had this tv for 3 months and have not a single issue with it  .
the price is not too high with the bundle that best buy had on this (sony bdp    s560 ht    ss360) i thought it is a good buy at $1999  .
i did not own a blu    ray player until now and use it often to upconvert my expansive collection of dvds  .
and as for the htib , i put that in my daughter's room as i already have a system for the xbr9  .
i have been a sonyite since i is a kid growing up on trinitrons and the walkman  .
well worth the price of admittion to hd in grand style  .
but the only downfall i had is that it is a bit difficult to connect to my network  .
i think it is a computer software glit on my modem rather than the tv .
granted , we have only had the set for a short time , but we are very happy  .
even our wii looks great (get the component cables) , which i know has not been the case for some lcd tvs  .
i think this set is worth the buy    up from similar models at costco because most of the sets there have older technology .
it's hard to tell in best buy because of all the different tv's but once you get it home you never look back .
if you want best lcd then get samsung or sony because they are all top ranking in cnet's review .
only had it a few days so still playing with the settings but uniformity issue is not going away in the end i'm sad to see my xbr 4 go  .
i've come to rely on cnet reviews but this particular one seemed very incomplete  .
i kept looking for a second page yet there was not one  .
in the past cnet reviews have been very detailed but that is not the case here for example   there is no mention of luminance levels , no mention of secondary color accuracy , and only a limited discussion of viewing angles    a long standing problem with lcds finally there is no real summation where the reviewer gives us his overall conclusion of where this hdtv stands vis    a    vis the other hdtvs he used for comparison far too much space is devoted to describing meaningless internet features and far too little time spent discussing the set's picture quality this is the most incomplete review i've ever seen cnet publish  .
stay away from this model  .
i will be looking for a different model when i replace it for the 3rd time since july .
it is not worth the money  .
the off angle performance is terrible  .
granted this is my first lcd , but if this is normal like the review said , then i will never buy an lcd  .
the colors washed out way too much (everything turned more grayish)  .
also picture during sports is not great  .
example is a ton of artifacts in the background while a runner is rounding third base  .
compared same picture against my older plasma (thank you dvr) and it is fine  .
ended up returning for a panasonic v10 , which has a better overall picture , better off angle , and cheaper .
sony will not stand behind there tv's .
i have been a sony person for over 20 years , and have alot of sony stuff , but after the way i have been treated with a warranty issue on my 2 month old sony kdl52    xbr9 (sony's top of the line lcd flagship model lcd )  .
to make a long story short the lcd panel went bad and sony will not stand behind their product  .
it will cost more than what i paid ($2200) to repair the less than 2 month old faulty panel  .
oh ya , they did offer me 30% off a new lcd from sonystyle ya right  .
i just want what i paid for i have always bought the better model so i do not have to worrie about warranty issues  .
but i have now learned that it means absolutely nothing  .
so really think about making a sony lcd purchase if you will ever have to warranty it you may find yourself s  .
thanks andyt  .
i am reaching out to the hdtv community to warn all of you about the sony xbr series  .
just google anything like  .
sony xbr lawsuit (lemon , recall , insert profanity here , etc)  .
first , i find it really interesting that cnet has no review on the xb5  .
i have an xbr5 and it has been repaired twice now (first long black horizontal lines , then jumping screen with the right half like zoomed in)  .
not to mention the motion is terrible    if it was not for blu    ray and the limited hd programming i have thru comcast i would highly recommend the good old fashioned crt  .
the xbr series is turning out to be lemon  .
which is so disappointing , as they have been lauded the leaders in the industry  .
how is this going unnoticed  .
i am just so thankful i purchased the 4    year warranty ; otherwise i would have been stuck with a very large $3500 paperweight  .
beware also that pixel burnout and more than 2 lamp replacements are not covered by most extended warranties , but don  .
t fret , you have much grander problems than that the warranty agent i spoke with said he processed 100's (not kidding) of warranty credits for the xbr series  .
here's how bad it is they gave me a $2000 credit at ultimate elec  .
and don't even want the xbr5 back  .
can you believe that  .
so i do not know what to buy anymore  .
samsung has too much glare , plasma's are discontinued , and led  .
s are too bright  .
i guess i will try the kdl52z5100  .
if anyone has info on that one please let me know .
we bought a kcl 52xbr lcd tv in feb 2008  .
as previously reported by others , in aug 2009 we experienced lines progressing to a black screen  .
at that time we were told by a tech that it is a due to a bad lcd panel  .
worse , when our installer contacted sony he is told there is only a 12 month warranty (when sony had extended to 18 months)  .
recall that sony has you register your purchase so that you could be notified of issues like a warranty extension , but of course this is only likely a ploy to sell your name  .
since the cost of repairs approached that of a replacement we passed on the repair  .
in researching a new tv , we learned of the special extended warranty on the 46 in models and of numerous reports of similar problems in the 52 inch products  .
breaking through customer support , we got to consumer affairs  .
they insisted on a report from a sony approved repair shop and proof of purchase  .
110  .
00 dollars later once again we we informed that the problem is a defective panel  .
two levels of customer affairs later sony's response is we'll assist you with covering 25% of the parts  .
sony will not even refund the wasted $ 110  .
00 on the service call they insisted on  .
the sony approved repair tech and our installer both have said they have experienced similar responses from sony , but that a few customers have their entire repair cost on these 52 inch tv's covered fully  .
needless to say , sony is not a honorable company fyi there is also a problem with an electronic module at the top of the these kdl xbr's  .
the problem source can be differentiated by the fact that if the module is responsible , the sony menus are unaffected .
buyer beware of sony products and definately purchase extended warrenty coverage that covers lcd screen replacement .
240Hz, power compared to plasma; Poor off angle, poor motion viewing, expensive (at time of writing)
Nice product for fisrt 10 minutes of use; Sony has a long history of defective LCD panels and electronic modules
Awesome TV if you get it on sale.; Stand doesn't feel as secure as I would like for a 52".
27 days of operation were great, watched Blu ray movies, SUPERBOWL.; SONY does not have a feindly repair process, this TV should be replaced with a new but they are not at all concerned of how this new TV that cost me $1765.00, is not performing at my house.
Deep blacks, sharp colors, 5.1 speakers remarkable, 720p movies look like 1080p, real time widgets and internet movies.; I expect more from the 240hz feature.
Amazing picture. The internet widgets are awesome.; There are no cons when it comes to the quality of the t.v. but the price was bit steep.
Brilliant colors are 3D life like. Awesome picture definition. Simple user interface to features and controls; Haven't found anything yet that is wrong or not working as advertised !
Turning 240hz on makes it so scrolling text in rock band doesn't get blurry. Also many other games have less blurring.. When I have my kitchen light on at night, it doesn't show up in the tv what so ever. Definitely better than glossy screens IMO.; Can't turn the screen that easily
The picture is amazing. It is pretty easy to operate.; I wish it had some different options for connecting to the internet for streaming VOD.
So far the picture is outstanding, black is black and the colors displayed seem crisp and vibrant. Sound quality for my bedroom has been outstanding. Matte screen greatly reduces glare from two windows and a ceiling fan light.; Nothing so far.
Nice picture at first; The picture changed and Sony said they would make it right.Until they got the repair bill then they offer me a new tv at full price.How nice.
Easy set up. Looks great. Deep blacks; screen uniformity seems pretty bad. Top left side of screen is not as dark as right. Contrast seems difficult to find a happy medium between nice dark blacks and being able to see detail in someones face or other object.
Loved the features it offered, especially the internet access. Also liked the number of inputs and types.; Had to return the first set within a month of purchase when a 2-3inch broad vertical band appeared right in the middle of the screen. The band made it impossible to watch anything.. Second set is also showing the same symptoms within a month.
This LCD TV has an excellent, true, and vivid picture quality. One word.....stunning. Its timeless, intriguing design puts it above the rest. The competition is fierce but this Sony LCD TV captures everything one could imagine. Excellent product.; Honestly, I couldn't find any.
Top of the line from Sony, and it offers practically everything that a person would want on a television set.; Wireless connection to router is difficult, if not impossible, to set up.
Great dejudder process and accurate color. Good contrast ratio to display dark scenes. Sony makes good LCD TV. I recommend you to check out http://www.squidoo.com/best-hdtv for information on the best price for the best HDTVs this year.; Samsung still performs slightly better in terms of picture quality according to CNET's review.
Amazing picture -- particularly the depth of the black. Crisp colors and contrast. Small frame takes up less room and looks good. Easy to set up and use. Latest technology. Sony reputation.; Expensive -- $1,899 on sale at Best Buy. Speakers point down and back. The z5100 has a speaker pointing forward. (Of course, easy to connect a sound system.) Manual is terrible -- download better one at website. Good, not great viewing angle.
I love the clarity of the picture. Its amazing when its adjusted to your satisfaction. The internet extras are an added plus for streaming video via the internet in HD. Lots of resources, such as crackle, netflix and youtube to name a few.; In the begining it was the price. But. I found an open box XBR9 52" for 1599.00 with the waranty.
The picture is sharp and crisp. The menu and graphics are very user friendly. Blacks are as dark as the plasmas. I especially loved the black frame. It is smooth on the eyes and the built-in speakers do not protrude the look. Quality Sony product.; Disliked that it could not be a bit thinner like the Samsung's.(although it is not an LED) Couldn't tell the difference between high and standard mode in Motion Flow setting &#38; Theatre orange button made shows and movies dimmer and duller.
Beautiful Picture, nice style and perfect remote, a lot of connections and I love the net-flix built into tv good sound for A lcd. When it WORKED! Now if only Sony would stand behind their "Flagship" model I could continue to enjoy it. SHAME ON SONY!; Sony has always been my choice of products and usually I have great luck, until now when I need them to warranty their product. I can truly understand why they have lost their top spot in tv's. Their customer service sucks and warranty is useless.
The TV is life like after calibration. Great deal after the XBR10 came out. I've looked at a lot of LED TV but picked this over the Samsung 7000/8000. I own the top of line Samsung 58" Plasma and it blows the picture out the door.; Took a while to understand the DLNA standard using Microsoft Media Server. If you do a lot of avi streaming the files have to be converted. I was hoping to loose the WD Media Server but that's not going to happen unless they change the software.
