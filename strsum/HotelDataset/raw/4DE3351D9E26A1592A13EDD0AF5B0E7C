this hotel is great value for london - we got a large room at £100 .
everything is new and beautifully decorated , the place has more of the ambiance and decor of a luxury spa in bali than a london business hotel .
service was good .
our room was large , stunning , with really comfortable huge bed , great shower , and free wi/fi .
one thing to consider is the location - whilst its by the river its not central , and its quite a way to the train or tube ( though there is a hotel shuttle ) .
fine if you 're in london for a short period and do n't mind heading out in the morning to sight see , and then back in the evening , but do n't expect sites or nightlife on your doorstep .
surrounding area , whilst not dangerous , could not be described as london 's most attractive either .
hotel shuttle to stations is handy - though for some reason is a relatively small hatch back car people carrier may be better option .
downsides - rooms might be too clever - lots of fancy controls linked to the tv to set different lighting effects , though not one that really made the room bright enough .
also the in room thermostat would not go below 25 degrees celsius leaving the room slightly hot .
also hotel restaurant the banyan tree , looks beautiful , great service , very bland overpriced food .
in summary - if you 're not fussy about location , and plan to eat your . . .
