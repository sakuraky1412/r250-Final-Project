just bought a forerunner 201 from ebay a week ago  .
many sellers available  .
under $100 for reconditioned unit from factory and 1 year warranty  .
love the virtual partner  .
set the pace and distance and off you go against your opponent  .
watch as it keeps track of your progress against your partner  .
no problem with gps  .
ran one of my routes that i had marked off with my vehicles odometer , and it is only off a couple steps  .
i had no problem downloading the information to my computer  .
nice graphs and map route info  .
even though the unit is larger than your watch  .
you cannot even tell that it is on your wrist while running  .
i would not run outside again without this unique gadget  .
great job garmin  .
first of all , this is the best of what is out there today (unless you want to lug a 5 lb gps meant to ride on the dashboard of your car) tremendous aid to any runner/biker  .
i run 5 yrs using a pedometer and one cannot expect any accuracy better than 5%  .
i've used the 201 for 2+ yrs/3000 miles and it is within 2% most of the time  .
there are instances where it will worse , especially in narrow streets or under tree cover (summer)  .
i agree that it is not tremendously accurate for race day , but my results where a lot better than those reported by another reviewer (a couple of examples   13  .
5 miles on a half marathon , and 6  .
5 miles on a 10k race)  .
it almost always errs on the + side  .
as for features , it works really well  .
big display , good backlight , really watertight , training assistant  .
i wish garmin would improve the gain on the gps antenna , although they may be limited here to keep its size reasonable  .
the new constellation of gps satellites that the us gov't started launching in late '05 may help get the accuracy to below 1%  .
the pc software is another cool thing that allows one to track all the runs bike outings  .
it'd be nice if it would keep these in separate logs  .
also , there are a number of third party programs that will take the forerunner data and map it on a street or satellite map showing the path you've taken in your workout .
i love my garmin forerunner because i can go anywhere and run wherever and i will always know how far i've gone and my pace  .
i can customize the display settings too .
i've owned the forerunner 201 for about 3 months  .
it has worked well for me  .
i use in trail running in sedona , az and recently used it during the pf chang's half    marathon in phoenix , az  .
it worked well through out the race and conformed with the official distances my only complaint is the pace readout seems to vary greatly for the that moment in time it is measuring  .
it shows me running a seven minute mile and and i will then glance down and it will show an eight minute mile  .
i've learned not to depend upon it as having a consistent reading of my pace i have not used it for navigation so i cannot comment on how that works .
after going through four forerunners (two of the 100 series and two of the 201) that have broken down for various reasons , i'm done with garmin  .
to their credit , they honor their warranties , but since they keep breaking down , that eventually does not do much good  .
two of the four failed because rain moisture seeped into the units (they are supposed to be waterproof)  .
one had the battery fail completely  .
for my last unit , the screen just died  .
repair fee is $70  .
00 i have friends who have had better luck  .
but i am thoroughly done  .
i do not recommend this gps system and will stay far away from garmin products in the future .
i is looking for a gps watch for running and came across this model  .
i did some research and this looked to be what i needed  .
it had all the features i wanted and is real easy to work/understand  .
the reason why i gave it a rating of 2  .
it worked once out of the three times i used it my very first run with it it could not get a signal  .
there were no leaves on the trees and i live in a very rural area so there weren't any large buildings in the way , it is a fairly cloudless day and it still couldn't get a signal  .
the second time i used it is the only time it worked  .
the third and final time i used it i is running on a trail (again no leaves on the trees and no big buildings) and it did not work i is frustrated and disappointed in the fact that even on a cloudless day out in the middle of no where it could not get a signal i do not recomend this product to any one .
i am deeply disapointed because i had the bad luck of having two different units with the same malfuntion , (it freezes and can�t perform any of it�s functions)  .
i spent u$ 65 , 00 in shipping and customs for having my first unit replaced , and now to have this new one repaired , i would have to spend another us$ 65 , 00  .
after a lot of complaints , they asked me to use they dhl account to send the unit to us without costs , but dhl here in brazil says that this is not a valid account number for brazil    us ; they would have to open a new account  .
i found out that there is an garmin authorized service here in sao paulo , but they don�t have the necessary parts nor the autorization from garmin to fix my forerunner i like the forerunner 201 but i don�t think it is fair to pay 50% of the price of a new one to have it repaired .
