if you are looking into getting into serious picture taking , but do not want to spend a fortune , this is what you need  .
it takes fantastic pictures and is so easy to use  .
i love everything about it  .
this is my first dslr so i�m by no means an expert on the subject  .
i purchased this camera as a transition to taking better photos and learning more about photography  .
i�ve really been enjoying using it and would recommend it to anyone considering taking a step up in digital photography  .
do a feature comparison between other similar products and you�ll see why the xsi comes out on top for an entry level dslr  .
photo quality is excellent with the new image processing chip in this camera , however it also depends on the lens that you�re using  .
the packaged 18    55mm lens is a great start , but i would recommend adding a telephoto lens as well  .
the only issue i�ve had with the camera is the shoulder strap , which came undone on its own while i is carrying the camera , i caught it before it hit the ground , but i�ve since put some stiches though the two ends of the straps to ensure that it doesn�t happen again .
i highly recommend it over nikon  .
canon is much more user friendly and at a more affordable price i opted for the kiss x2/ xsi/ 450d because i did not need video and 15mp of 500d  .
the 500d costs almost $100 usd more , and i thought it unnecessary the camera is alot of fun  .
and i am 100% satisfied with my decision  .
i had weighed buying a g11 before , but realized slr quality will always be above that if you want to step up your photos , on a budget , its the perfect buy .
best digital slr for the money  .
if there is something better , i cannot imagine what it is .
i am very satisfied with my purchase of the xsi  .
first off , if you are looking for a dslr , you can read all all the reviews in the world , but what you should focus on first and foremost is how the camera feels in your hand  .
so , set your budget first , get to a camera store and pick up all of the cameras in your price range and play with them for a while  .
once you pick a few that you like , then read the reviews on cnet , etc this camera is great for my small hands , and my husband (who had larger hands) states he likes the feel of it  .
i love the small size and weight  .
i can carry it around all day without a problem  .
the kit lens is actually a great lens optically (especially based on the price)  .
the menus are simple the buttons easy to press and change function settings however  if you are buying a dslr (any dslr) solely because you think it will make you take pictures better than your point and shoot camera , you might be disappointed with this or any dslr  .
you really do have to be willing to learn how to shoot in manual mode , adjust shutter speed , aperture , iso , etc  .
you can likely take pictures that are on par with cameras costing several thousands of dollars with this camera , but you have to put in the time to learn photography  .
a lot of my friends are disappointed with all of their fancy new expensive dslrs because they only use program or auto mode  .
just some food for thought but back to the xsi  .
i love the camera  .
not too much noise at high isos , a great dslr without breaking the bank .
excellent camera  .
what other camera with this grade of quality can you pick up with a 18    55mm is af and 55    250mm is af lens kit for under $750  .
i could go on forever but i will say buy one now  .
you will not regret it  .
for the money hard pressed to find better performance  .
the rebel xsi (eos 450d) is a great dslr camera , perfect for beginners and pros  .
the image quality is excellent and boasts great performance  .
i love the large 3 inch screen and it is great that it has live view , although i do not use that feature much  .
i like that the camera is easy to get into as a beginner and you can gradually get deeper into the settings and manual adjustments  .
there are the auto and scene mode options , as well as the full manual controls  .
the my menu feature is also handy  .
the camera is comfortable to hold and overall a nice purchase .
my preferred camera  .
i could say   exactly as my nikon af used to be 20 years ago .
trust me , you wo not regret your choice , just go out and run it through its stuff .
after i purchased this camera , i sold my sony a350 , dsc    f717 , and my rebel xti it's a great camera buy one you will love it .
this is my first dslr , but i have used p s cameras before  .
i really like it , just take a bit of learning about proper exposure , and most of my pictures come out really good  .
compared to the rebel xt and xti , this new xsi with the new 18    55 is kit lens is superior in every way  .
the focusing is faster and more accurate  .
the exposure is right on  .
i found the spot metering to work well too  .
wish the spot area is smaller to be more accurate , but for this price range it is acceptable  .
the camera has many customizable features that can make your pictures sharper  .
i am having fun experimenting its many advanced features , and my pictures are superior to the previous models  .
the new 55    18 is lens is a fantastic bargain as a kit lens  .
grab it , it takes unbelievable sharp pictures  .
i took a hand    held picture of my dog at 1/8 of a second , and i could not believe how sharp it came out  .
the len's is feature works great , give you about 3 f stops cushion  .
i am very impressed with this new camera kit  .
i highly recommend it for both advanced shutter bugs as well as beginners .
the bottom line this is a great camera for beginning and intermediate photographers  .
the slew of setting options for the camera make it great for someone who is afraid to use anything other than the auto settings , all the way to someone using all manual settings and about to move to a more professional camera  .
the iso options do lack on this camera , and can fall short in some cases  .
but through the use of other setting this shortfall can be made up for if you know how to use the manual settings properly  .
all in all , this is a well rounded camera and can be a great camera when in the hands of a good photographer .
easy to use with great photo results .
after a year of trying out dslr's and reading countless reviews , i purchased the xsi  .
i really enjoy using it and am looking forward to acquiring a couple of nice lenses (a wide angle or primary and a zoom are high on my wish list) and being more photographically active it fits nicely in my hands and is easier for me to use than the larger canons and some of the better nikons i considered the t1i but for the price difference , which is mainly to add hd movie capability , the xsi is an choice  .
i can put the $300 i save into a quality lens .
my wife and i love this camera  .
we bought it about a month and a half ago and bring it where ever we go  .
the quality of the images is great  .
there is a lot of advanced features however i enjoy being able to turn it on auto and not have to worry about my settings  .
i have not learned how to disable the flash other then pressing the button half way down and when the flash pops up i press it back down and then take my picture  .
the live view is nice for finding focus with astrophotography but in a real shooting environment the 1/2 sec delay between pressing the button and shooting makes it less then a point and shoot  .
the advanced features of the camera allow you to grow and advance your skills at your own pace  .
we were going to purchase another point and click but with my son growing up we wanted something that we could use for years to come and this is a great choice .
as my first dslr , i could not ask for a better camera  .
light and easy to use , the pictures it produces are nothing short of astounding , even using the toy    like 18    55mm kit lens that came with the camera  .
only issue i have is that the right hand grip seems a bit small , but then i've got large hands great starter camera for those wishing to upgrade from a point    and    shoot  .
the xsi is a break through camera in many respects  .
it's image quality of it's sensor is remarkable for any 12 mp camera , regardless of price  .
the is kit 18    55mm lens is the best ever offered by canon and is highly useable by photographers of virtually any level  .
canon has never offered a camera with as good image quality at iso's 400 , 800 and 1600  .
the xsi makes a great first camera , but also a potentially valuable second or third body for the more experienced photographer  .
the camera body weighs very little and fits into the space occupied by a single lens in a camera pack  .
the xti is an excellent camera in almost all respects , but the xsi moves the 'entry level' canon camera ahead in almost every area  .
the only negatives i can think of are the switch sd cards , the need for 'another' new battery and charger and while you can pre    set settings in 'my menu' , it would excellent if there were 'one button' access to mirror lock up on all canon camers .
i got the kit lens with this camera  .
i had a canon xt and though it is still a great camera i wanted to update it  .
i looked at the xti and loved the larger screen but good thing i waited a bit more for the xsi  .
the larger screen is a god send  .
no more small screens to read the menu  .
the focusing is faster and the is lens is an improvement from previous models  .
i is debating to get this or the 40d since the 40d is supposed to be a step    up from a basic model  .
glad i chose the xsi .
you'll be missing out if you pass on this product  .
a lot of helpful gadgets  .
putting on different lenses is very simple .
my xsi is only a few days old , so i have not had a chance to put it through it's paces  .
i have the original digital rebel and the sony f717 for 5 years , but i have been using my friend's xti for the pass year  .
with the few shots i have taken with the xsi i am already impressed with the image quality at all settings  .
i had no problem navigating my way around the buttons and menu right out of the box and the is feature on the lens is a plus  .
i am dying to try it with the 55    250mm efs is lens .
this is my first digital slr  .
came down to either the canon 450d xsi and the nikon d80 it seems there are nikon people and there are canon people , i is always a minolta guy , so when it came time to buying my first dslr , i did a lot of research  .
there are pros and cons to both the canon and the nikon  .
my brother is a canon guy and my sister is a nikon girl , they both presented their case and in the end i agreed with my brother  .
a few of his arguements stuck with me , one is that the canon is able to use nikon lenses while the nikon cant use canon lenses  .
second the canon is 2 mega pixels more  .
third , while you're able to take amazing pictures with both cameras , both are entry level dslr , neither one is going to make you a professional photographer  .
that being said , the first picture i took with my new canon 450d xsi is probably the most beautiful picture i've ever taken  .
the colors and shadows are so vibrant and the detail is sooo incredibly sharp  .
i cant say enough good things about it .
this is my 3rd  .
dslr , first one being nikon d200 , then canon 350d and now 450d (xsi in usa)  .
vast improvement over the previous 350d model  .
kit lens does not look cheapy anymore , decent engineering and good looks with a bonus of image stablizing system  .
i use kit lens along with ef 28    135 is usm lens  .
excellent resolution and sharpness  .
no wonder it's selling like hot cakes here in thailand  .
this is my third slr (xi , nikon d60 and this xsi) and this is by far the best camera i have ever purchased  .
the kit lens is ok , but you're going to want one with a little more zoom and clarity almost immediately  .
that said , you're only paying an extra 100 for it , so i guess it's kinda worth it .
i would highly reccomend this camera mostly because of the great pictures it takes  .
cnet has rated this as a 7  .
8 on a 1    10 scale , but they gave the xti a 7  .
8 rating also while the xsi's video review seemed to say that it is better than the xti  .
so it appears to me that they should have rated it higher than a 7  .
anyway , i believe i have a great camera , and i do not think you can go wrong with canon .
i have enjoyed a lot using the camera , it never disappoints , i love it even with it's little flaws , because my main concern is image quality , wich is very good using raw mode  .
the camera is very easy to use , lightweight and battery life is enough for even two long photography sessions  .
i love it since my last camera is a sony h1  .
i know the xsi is out of date , but i just joined cnet so i wanted to leave my comments greetings from guatemala , by the way  .
i got it on sale here in l  .
for $500  .
which means there is a replacement coming soon  .
i've only seen better pictures on cameras that cost much more  .
great entry level srl for the $$$  .
i love this camera  .
highly recommended to new users  .
am so happy with my new canon xsi camera  .
i is torn between it and a nikon d90 and i'm not disappointed  .
with the extra money i bought another lens and assesories  .
this camera is light weight (just had hand surgery and have no streghth in my hand) and it has everything i want in a camera .
i like this eos because of the qualites of the image and for a small fast it does great inside pictures even in more dark place when program right  .
this camera is worth the buy  .
i've used canon eos xt (350d) earlier  .
450d is better younger brother of this camera  .
i'm contented of my xsi beacause i have good quality of photos for a quite good money  .
photography is my biggest passion and in future i want to buy more advanced canon camera , for example eos 50d  .
effects of my work with canon (and panasonic earlier) at   www  .

i spent a ton of time evaluating all the slrs in my budget  .
i just took a film photography class and discovered i loved photography , but i couldn't decide which camera i wanted  .
i have a lot of friends who went with the nikon d80 , and when i picked up both of them at the store , my hand liked the d80 more than the xsi  .
however , when i got to the operation of the camera , the xsi made a lot more sense  .
the operations on the d80 seemed overly    complicated and besides that , it just felt old , considering the xsi is just released  .
i have to say , i'm loving the xsi , but it was not long before i got bored of the kit lens (18    55 ef    s is)  .
now , i'm shooting with a canon 50mm f/1  .
8 mki , from the 80s (i think) , very nice piece of glass , similar to what i is using for my film camera  .
i encourage everybody who buys an xsi to buy a 50mm  .
they're relatively cheap and the optical quality is way better than the kit lens if you're not going to use the creative modes , you might as well buy another camera  .
i find that if i put it in auto mode , it actually feels like a different camera  .
in the creative modes , it feels nearly identical to shooting on film without all the developing time and chemicals  .
almost feels too easy  .
after doing some night shots with film , i wanted to do some night shooting  .
initially , i is disgusted at the noise with long exposures , but turning on the long exposure noise reduction function yields incredible results  .
a 5    second exposure at iso 100 looks quite controlled , even for the pixel    picky  .
i didn't know about that function when i bought it , but i'm so glad it's there shooting in raw , adobe rgb , 50mm f/1  .
8 , and processing with aperture on my mac (running leopard) is almost heavenly  .
using a new imac , macbook pro , or mac pro is the ideal system for the photographer  .
i thought i would be bummed that there are no firewire sdhc card readers currently available , but the camera's built    in usb 2  .
0 is actually not as bad as i feared it would be  .
it feels really fast here's how i made my decision   the d80   too old and big  .
the d60   doesn't have a mechanical focus coupling or something like that  .
if i recall , all the current nikkor prime lenses (the ones i would want the most) require focus couplings , if you don't have one , those lenses won't auto    focus (that's a deal    breaker for me) the xsi is a terrific camera for me  .
it leaves me lots of room to grow as a photographer without overwhelming me with features and operations i do not need .
great camera  .
fantastic pics  .
slighly slower than 40d the handle does not ergonomically feel right  .
i almost need a third joint in my fingers to be able to grab the camera comfortablly  .
as a result after a while my hand gets really sore  .
i do not have this problem with 40d which is bulkier just enough to fit righ in my hand  .
and i do have pretty average size hands also it autofocus sometimes has problem finding the right focus in low light photography .
the xsi , being my 3rd dslr , is a nice camera with many features  .
i find that the color reproduction in my pictures are more to my liking than with my old d70 (personal preference)  .
i love the larger 3 inch lcd display  .
12mp is probably over kill unless you do a lot of cropping or extremely large prints  .
if you have big hands the camera will probably be a bit uncomfortable to hold , as i have smaller hands and i find it could use a tad bit more on the height  .
the menu layout is good and easy to navigate  .
pictures are written to memory quickly (using extreme iii)  .
the live view is about worthless , to me anyways  .
its slow and the auto focus does not responded well  .
the kit lens will be fine if you are a novice or just like to point and shoot  .
although this does have improvements over the xti , you'll have to decide if it's worth the extra $$ for the few extra features  .
the xti can be had for much less and you can get a nice lens with the $$ you save  .
if you are an hobbiest or experienced photographer i would definitely consider the 40d for not much more .
good camera but i prefer the a200 the reviewer said though it'll run you a few bucks more than competitors such as the sony alpha dslr    a200 or the nikon d60 , the canon eos rebel xsi will deliver slightly better performance and noticeably better photo quality in return , making it a worthwhile trade    off  .
i do not know what to say about that  .
i did some extensive comparisons on line at various web sites that had photographic samples and for the life of me i cannot see a significant difference in iq between this camera and the a200 (or the d60 for that matter) even at 100%  .
for that reason i like the sony for the built in image stabilization and better overall handling (and lower price)  .
looking for insignificant differences in iq at the pixel level has no practical value .
the performance is not enough for the price .
would the xsi be better choice or the 40d  .
my 450d's images are not only overexposed but bloated , soft , undersaturated and soggy 20 december 1009  .

canon uk limited  .
dear mr vickers  .
i am assured that any attempt to communicate with you is a waste of time , since you or your secretary will simply pass my letter back to your second line customer support team  .
these appear to be judge and jury not merely as regards the quality of your rather    expensive products , but of canon's accountability as an entity within the public and corporate domains  .
nonetheless , persisting in my hope that canon's managing director might not be a deity entirely removed from the domain of mortal communication , i thought i'd give you a shot first , something that amused me a little  .
having tested your digital camera's performance quantitatively using adobe photoshop cs3 , i am advised by mr lalit dhiri of your second line technical team that canon does not recognise adobe systems , believing them to lack credibility and to represent merely third party software  .
forgive me if i attach little credence to mr dhiri at the best of times , since his team's third attempt to repair my camera has left it in a worse state than when i bought it  .
i'm left with less faith in your technical team than i would place in a 1950's weston bakelite selenium light meter    something of which mr dhiri has doubtless never heard  .
perhaps this is the answer   to write off the electronic systems in your camera and to use instead my old dad's collection of photographic antiques  .
a recent exchange of emails with mr aaron edgeworth (of your second line support team) serves to sum up this case    .
re   canon    this is not good enough  .
to   aaron_edgeworth@cuk  .
canon  .
dear mr edgeworth  .
have you not seen any of my foregoing correspondence with your canon uk repair centre  .
since it would seem that you have not   i have supplied your colleagues with image after image showing in quantifiable and scientifically valid terms , how badly this camera differs from what would be acceptable in a camera costing a quarter the price  .
the data i supplied have nothing to do with matters of opinion or taste  .
they detail the numerous and hopeless failings of this camera with measured precision  .
please would you familiarise yourself with these repeated submissions before we take our correspondence further i have in my hand a panasonic lumix which cost a third of what your slr cost  .
its impeccable images beat the stuffing out of yours  .
i is going to say that your camera is the worst i have had since i is seventeen years old , since for my eighteen birthday my father bought me the pentax km slr upon which i learnt my technique and my trade  .
this is 34 years ago  .
but come to think   the images i gained as a child from a kodak instamatic were more reliably exposed than the canon's  .
so i think we have to count this canon 450d camera my worst ever  .
correcting its grotesque failings has wasted hours if not days of my creative life  .
i am sorry that i ever bought it ; for it has proved my biggest waste of money in fifty    two years i no longer have faith in your repairs team  .
yes   i could provide more raw and also corrected images , showing that since its last repair the 450d is worse than when i first bought it  .
but since you have no familiarity with what i have already shown to your organisation   why should i waste more time and effort to duplicate what should already be staring you in the face  .
you have supplied a product which is not worthy of your reputation and which is , to quote your more helpful colleague on the canon telephone helpline , unfit for purpose  .
now is high time to do something about it  .
if i were in canon's shoes i should feel so deeply ashamed that i should take matters into my hands for the sake of professional repute and honest , decent practice stephen jackson  .
[ returning to my letter to mr vickers  ]  .
the reason that i did not return the eos 450d to the vendor (ebuyer) within its one    year guarantee is because of my misplaced faith in your repairs team and in canon's corporate standards , its repute  .
now it is canon's glib effort to pass the buck , to dump the buck on anybody but yourselves , that has left me sick to the teeth  .
it is this that leaves me indignant to a degree that i have not felt in many years  .
all you can do is to repeat with your fingers in your ears that i must pass your problem onto another company in the hope that they might show the sense of decency and fair play that canon so manifestly lacks   that they , unlike you , will be prepared to go the extra mile if only i had known at the outset that your customer support has even less interest in resolving legitimate grievances than it has in making good canon's mistakes , that contacting you is a waste of time and that i should return a faulty product to the vendor forthwith   how different my last fourteen months would have been .
most people seem to love this camera , so i can only assume i have a bad one , or the lens that came with it is so bad as to ruin the camera's functionality i purchased this as costco , with an ef    s 18    55 mm lens included i started out with the point and click mode , not expecting much , but expecting better than my standard point and click camera  .
imagine my surprise when the indoor picture taken is not even remotely as focused as my 6mp kodak z612 (which has a killer zoom for a point and click , and great outside pics , but is not very good inside)  .
so i moved on to the creative modes  .
no matter what i did , or how i adjusted , the kodak outperformed the canon in sharpness , color , color contrast and image stabilization  .
you cannot even adjust the iso on the kodak , and i still got sharper indoor pictures i did not like that i is unable to turn off the flash in auto mode , only in creative mode i also found that when i adjusted the settings , the first picture taken took longer to snap than subsequent pictures , like the camera is trying to figure out what is different  .
all subsequent pictures snapped quickly , until i changed settings again the canon is great for speed , and long about the third picture in a burst , the focus usually came through , but i'm usually a single shot person  .
i've tried two , maybe costco got a bad batch , but the camera is unusable unless you want fuzzy pictures .
