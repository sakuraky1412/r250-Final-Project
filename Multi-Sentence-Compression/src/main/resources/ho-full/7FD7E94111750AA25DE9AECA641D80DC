extensive refurbishment has been carried out , and having stayed in different rooms on both levels of the annexe , now have our favourite room at the end of the bottom corridor , room 20 , which we have already booked for next year .
like all the lower rooms , it opens on to the patio in front of the river , but is a little on the dark side .
however , it is roomy , quiet , has a nice new bathroom with bath and shower , very comfortable twin beds , and an up to date tv with freeview .
it may be that these rooms vary , -certainly , the rooms above have a panoramic view , and are brighter , some are double rooms , and one at the top of the stairs always seemed to be unduly warm .
the breakfast routine has certainly improved , with butter , marmalade , jam etc .
now being provided in dishes , and on a sunday , the cooked breakfasts are all individually prepared now , as on weekdays , rather than having to help oneself from hot plates .
the staff have always been very helpful , and it looks as though the hotel is now getting the investment it certainly needed .
