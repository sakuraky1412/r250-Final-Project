the major problem was how management handed the only issue we reported : the ac was not working for 3 of the 5 nights of our stay .
after reporting it to the front desk ( to no avail ) we spoke to the manager in charge ( mrs rivolt ) , who not only dismissed our complaint stating she had no record that we already reported the problem , but also assumed no liability for the lack of action .
the ac was finally replaced the following day and with the outside temps in the 80s it was not a pleasurable experience .
the inn includes several buildings with a motel outline : room doors opening on a common balcony .
the main bdg has a reception staffed 24hrs/day , a concierge desk with erratic hrs , although when around , the concierge staff was helpful ( sylvia ) .
it is a 15 minute walk to the marina from which you can board the ferries to the islands of vieques and culebra , so the location is convenient .
the neighborhood is sketchy , we did not feel safe walking after 5pm , but mornings are ok .
the major pluses are the many amenities including two large pools , a mini golf ( $ 2 fee/person ) , a large fitness room , a tennis court , basketball field and small playground .
there are also 2 restaurants .
lonely planet recommended the mexican , which we found to have slow service and mediocre food .
the room and the common spaces were spotlessly clean and the grounds are very nicely . . .

the room and the common spaces were spotlessly clean and the grounds are very nicely landscaped , though the one time we wanted to walk through the garden the guard told us to do it quickly so we would not be seen ( by whom , we could not understand ) .
