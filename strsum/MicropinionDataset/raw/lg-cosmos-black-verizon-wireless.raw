Cons:. NONE SO FAR.

$$;
Pros:. Great for those don't need a smart phone.. 
Cons:. None so far.. 
Summary:. It was a great deal at Costco's.. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the keyboard,GPS, the size isnt bulky..... 
Cons:. I cant think of one single con other than it costs me for email.... 

$$;
Pros:. nice qwerty keyboard. 
Cons:. back plate of phone falls off easily.. 
Summary:. I loved this phone as my first phone. I am a big klutz, so I dropped this phone a couple of times, and it even went for a ride in my washing machine, but it still survived completely. I love how you don't need any data package. The qwerty keyboard is pretty nice also. This was actually a better phone than I thought it was going to be.. 

$$;
Pros:. Easy to use, full QWERTY keyboard, decent camera and it feels and looks nice.. 
Cons:. Lacks video recording and sometimes lags.. 
Summary:. Really good phone with 4 row QWERTY keyboard and nice camera but it doesnt have a video recorder and it sometimes can lag. I like the display and it is very nice to look at. The keys on the keyboard are just right and it feels good to hold. I highly recommend it!. 

$$;
Pros:. i liked that it has a full key board, and also has a row for the numbers.. 
Cons:. i was disappointed that the cosmos does not have video recording on it.. 
Summary:. over all a good phone, and is good when u slide it. it changes really fast. 

$$;
Pros:. I am very happy with the texting, full keyboard and all, and the calling is quick and easy. Also, adding contacts is very simple.. 
Cons:. The internet connection could have been better.. 
Summary:. When I first saw this phone on the shelf in Verizon Wireless, I immediately noticed how simple and easy-to-use it looked. I loved how it had a full keyboard and everything which is perfect for texting. So, I decided to take it. The setup was very easy and it only took an hour to get used to. However, I wasn't so happy with the internet, even though I don't use it that often. Every other feature was very handy and fast. This phone has fit perfectly in my busy life!. Updated. on Sep 2, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. I like the texting and the organization of my contacts. I love the social networks and just about everything about this phone.. 
Cons:. There are only 2 cons i have..... 1 the camera its a nice camera but no flash. 2 the texting can be a little slow at times but not always. 
Summary:. Overall this phone is a good choice because it has a few issues but they can all be overlooked.. 

$$;
Pros:. keyboard feels nice. battery life is better then my old phone.. charger is a USB and can charge through a laptop.. cheap. 
Cons:. Camera start error - if it happens slide it open and lightly push or pull the sidled part and try again. I dont experience it anymore though.. 
Summary:. I dont need a smart phone, I dont need the social networking, all I needed was... a phone, with a qwerty keyboard for faster texting. and the phone works well! the ringtones it came with are halfway decent. sadly these days there are no longer free games, only trials of tetris and pacman. Overall this phone does exactly what I need, and Im happy with it.. 

$$;
Pros:. keyboard is great, its definitley not confusing at all (maybe its just me, but all LG phones have the least confusing menu and set up and stuff) camera is ok, and it has some features like you can download music and games.. 
Cons:. I do not like the fact that theres no video recorder, and no music player. :(. 
Summary:. i just wish it had a video recorder and a music player. the only 3 verizon phones that didnt need a data package and had a qwerty keyboard were the pantech jest, lg cosmos, and samsung intensity. i picked this one because the keyboard was the most roomy and i really like the social networking features (even though i dont have any). &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3.

$$;
Pros:. This phone fits my attitude and personality, it is sleek, simple, smart looking, and inexpensive. It keeps me connected with friends and family and organized for school and work. Even texting is much easier and error free with slightly larger keys.. 
Cons:. I haven't found anything that I don't like about this phone so far.. 
Summary:. To assist with staying connected to others, the QWERTY texting board has slightly bigger keys than most standard cell phones which allows for easy texting and error free messages. As a result, I am able to stay on top of important issues and connect with others more efficiently. Some of the general tools that are must haves for my daily routine are the calendar, notepad, stop watch, alarm, and the to-do-list. I do have 25 MB Data &#38; Web with Mobile Email which is awesome to keep track of my favorite football and basketball stats, news, and for other occasional uses, it is not too much, just enough! I love this product, it is exactly what I need for my lifestyle.. 

$$;
Pros:. The call quality is relatively good. The users on the other end have said that my voice is clear as a bell. Texting keyboard is decent. Phone is sturdy.. 
Cons:. Buttons depress easily when phone is stored in purse or other type of baggage.. 
Summary:. I use this phone mostly for calls and the occasional texting and picture texting. If you want a good camera, get a camera. It takes decent pictures, but it's no Cannon. I selected this phone due to the fact that I didn't have to purchase a data package. There aren't too many phones out there anymore that don't require one. I like the pay as you go feature. The set-up is easy and the phone has as many features as I'll ever use. At first, the battery life wasn't too good, but after a month of ownership, that has improved greatly.. 

$$;
Pros:. Over all design is good. 
Cons:. Lags a little. 
Summary:. This is a good messageing phone and is nice and light and compact. I have had it for 2 days and have had no problems besides it is a little slow sometimes bringing up menus.. 

$$;
Pros:. 1. The qwerty keyboard is good, but not the best despite the small buttons.. 2. It's cool that you can multi-task. For example you can call someone and text someone else at the same time.. 3. Its durable... droped it like 30 times. 
Cons:. It has a weak battery life. It's kinda slow not synced when you text quickly.. 
Summary:. Its a good phone especially its good 4 your kid's first phone.. 

$$;
Pros:. Larger letter keys, spaced a little more than other phones so you don't accidentally hit the wrong letter all the time! Very easy to use.. 
Cons:. It feels a little dinky. But it seems to be holding up great for me.. 
Summary:. I was looking for the most basic phone possible with a QWERTY keyboard and this is what I chose. I love it. It is nothing fancy, so if you want email, Facebook, Myspace, and all that sort of stuff this probably isn't the best phone for you. But as far as calling people and texting goes, it is fantastic and I'm thrilled I bought it!. 

$$;
Pros:. Nice qwerty keyboard, good sized phone, nice camera, front keypad is easy to use. 
Cons:. Battery life isn't too great if you text a lot, speaker button the front gets in the way, and so does the mic button on the other side. 
Summary:. Overall, a good phone and I would recommend it to my friends. It's one of the nicer phones from Verizon that you don't have to get a data package with.. 

$$;
Pros:. This is a great phone. It is simple to use.. 
Cons:. Non so far.. 
Summary:. If you want a simple phone, a working one then get this one. 

$$;
Pros:. Good spacing between qwerty keys. Like the favorites shortcut. Very good call quality:good speaker too. Great look. 
Cons:. The sliding mechanism gets "stuck" sometimes on the row with the up arrow, but this is no real problem.. 
Summary:. over all, this is a very good phone for a first phone or a first messaging phone. I have only had this phone for one day and I already love it. The qwerty keys work very well and have good spacing between them. The favorites shortcut is convienent. The call quality is very good and the speaker has good quality. This is a great phone if you want a good messaging phone but don't want to pay more for it.. Updated. on May 29, 2010. 

$$;
Pros:. No data plan req'd. Good spacing between keys on the keyboard. Very good voice quality. Battery life not terrible. Very good pictures for a 1.3MP camera. Bing Local Search is a great Poor-Man's Google Maps.. 
Cons:. Verizon OS. Verizon browser(!!!) 2.5mm headset jack. Strange charging issues. Keyboard buttons a bit stiff. The phone itself is pretty thick.. 
Summary:. Great if you want a qwerty keyboard but can live w/o 3G data costs. The keyboard is a good bet for people w/ larger thumbs, although a bit stiff. The Social Network shortcuts are a nice thought, but implemented poorly. The feel is solid for a plastic phone, but I feel like I need to be very careful w/ it. Scratches already appearing on the screen. (Buy a screen saver!) The quality of display is good.. Battery life: I can get 2-3 days of light calls and text, but typically one day per charge.. I'm no fan of MicroSoft, but the integrated Bing Search is slow but handy. Allow it to use your GPS location, type in 'Irish Pub', and it will come back with a good amount of bars currently near you, including a map, directions from your location, and a Call link. On a more advanced phone, I would HATE this feature, but on a cheap phone, it's a blessing.. Verizon MobilWeb browser is still laughably horrible. Unusable.. Despite Verizon's attempt to wreck this phone w/ their software, it has good call quality, good features, good hardware and decent battery life.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good size, &#38; front of phone is very nice. Lots of choices in set up and good call reception. If familiar with cell phones, the set up is easy. Easy to see as well. Love the Hot pink rubberish protection plate I was able to get with it. So far so good. 
Cons:. The sliding mechanism seems weak, worried how long it will last. The qwerty key pad takes some getting used to as the symbopls are moved to different keys. These keys are also small but still useable.. 
Summary:. The first feeling I got was that it WAS an entry level phone and I am a long time user/texter. Anything to get away fromt he Lg enV though.. The only real worry that I have so far is the sliding mechanism seems a little unsturdy. The QWERTY symbols have changed places so that will take some getting used to.. The sound quality is excellent and I actually had to turn the volume down, Can't remember ever having to do that before.. Love the front of it and the keys. They have a good feel and are easy to use.. I have only had this phone for 24 hrs but so far I like it enough. Some days I wish I had never changed from my Env 2.. Very Happy that verizon does not demand the data plan with this phone or I would not have gotten it.. Love the price, cheap is good as long as there's quality too.. 

$$;
Pros:. Good battery life. 
Cons:. Lousy audio quality. Seems cell phone makers are more interested in texting and other uses than the basic phone qualities. Should have antenna for better reception.. 
Summary:. Good for a basic starter phone except for audio quality and for a freebie I guess you can't knock it too much.. 

$$;
Pros:. I love that you can either use the front numeric pad for texting or use the QWERTY keyboard. I love the slide function and the QWERTY keys are very well spaced and easy to use. The camera takes great pictures, too, and call quality is great.. 
Cons:. Tends to freeze at times and battery must be removed and replaced to fix it.. It also reboots itself from time to time which can be frustrating if in the middle of a text. The front keypad keys are awfully close together, can often push wrong button.. 
Summary:. I switched from the enV touch because I wanted the slide QWERTY and also the functionality of the front keypad. Some of the characters on the QWERTY were moved from those on the enVs, which has still taken a lot of getting used to. The QWERTY keypad is roomy, though, which is nice.. I like how you can thread text messages, but the viewing capability is poor. If you want to view the oldest message from one person, there is no fast-track to it - you have to push the down arrow until you get all the way to the bottom.. The call quality is great. I have never had a problem dropping calls or with sound quality. The camera takes great pictures, too.. Because of the tendency to freeze and reboot itself, I called Verizon and exchanged it for a "certified like new" Cosmos. After a month, I am still having all of the same issues.. 

$$;
Pros:. make a poo. 
Cons:. drop a number 2. 
Summary:. i like the phone but there are some problems i cant stand... when i have about 150 txts it becomes very slow when i go into messaging ,, the batterlife is not as good as my old phone the voyager.. the keyboard sounds like its loosing up. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone is easy to use. Great phone if you're looking for a basic phone for just talking and texting. Camera also works well. And there is also a calendar where you can add appointments and get alerts.. 
Cons:. There is no way to tell that you've missed a call, or that you have a message waiting without actually checking the screen display of your phone. There needs to be a blinking light to indicate that you've received a call/text.. 
Summary:. The phone would be perfect in my opinion if it only had the "blinking light" to let me know I've missed a call or have a message waiting. The QWERTY keyboard is big and easy to use; the camera works well; and the calendar is a nice feature to have for reminders.. 

$$;
Pros:. great texing phone, never tex'd until i got this phone.. that press the key 3 times to get to a letter sucked, the key board makes it easy. 
Cons:. no music player! the verizon salesman is an idiot. told us all we needed to do was buy a 2gig card and we could store and play........ sucker!. 
Summary:. having fun texing with the slide key board easy to use... 

$$;
Pros:. The wallpaper changes with the portrait/landscape view; the sounds and tones are cute; comfortable front keys; able to change font sizes and types; better themes than some others I've had.. 
Cons:. Auto-cap doesn't work at all; way too many screens to get to the texting screen; others have a hard time hearing me.. 
Summary:. I haven't had a problem with lag, like some others, but I'm a huge grammar Nazi and the fact that the LG Cosmos absolutely refuses to auto-cap annoys me to no end. The other thing that is extremely annoying (and it's not limited to this phone, my boyfriend's does this too), is that, for a "messaging" phone, you have to jump through a LOT of hoops to select your texting recipient and actually get to the texting part. The "favorites" option doesn't help either. Message &gt; New Message &gt; Txt Message &gt; Add &gt; From Contacts &gt; Mark &gt; Done &gt; OK &gt; finally the texting screen. It doesn't help that, even though this is an LG phone and almost completely identical to the Rumor2, my old VirginMobile phone, the side buttons do different things than the Rumor2. Those last two complaints may be a Verizon thing, though.. Not happy with it at all in terms of texting. Calling, apparently, isn't so great as well. I have to talk very loudly for others to hear me. Not sure if this is a distance thing, or the phone, or Verizon, but I dislike it anyway.. 

$$;
Pros:. the key board is nice.. 
Cons:. There is a design flaw with this phone. If you have the back cover on the jack does not sit well and pops out &#38; you can not hear your caller. If you take the back off it works just fine.. 

$$;
Pros:. The phone seems fairly solid and I have had no issues with dropped calls. Call quality seems average as well. Nice messaging phone with a QWERTY keyboard that is easy enough to navigate with slightly raised keys.. 
Cons:. Poor battery life on this phone!. 
Summary:. Abysmal Battery Life and I am stuck with it since Verizon doesn't seem to care. Plan on keeping the charger handy since it maintains a charge for 1 day max. Sure Verizon suggested a mongo extended life battery to augment the lifespan...great but that would result in turning the little Cosmos into Gordon Gekko's gargantuan brick.. 

$$;
Pros:. The keyboard was very easy to type on.. 
Cons:. The front keyboard was very slow. It would often drop a letter or add one. It then suddenly broke on me. I will admit that sometimes I will drop my phone, but yesterday it hadn't been dropped or even mishandled. The front screen stopped working.. 
Summary:. I liked the phine in the beginning, but the camera quality proved to be less than satisfactory. There is no video on this phone and the front keyboard sucked. I wouldn't reccomende this phone since it randomly broke on me.. 

$$;
Pros:. The only real thing I like about this phone is the front key pad. I find it very easy to type on.. 
Cons:. I think this phone has no memory (I even have a memory card), the camera is of pour quality, the slide out key board is to long, and I've had two of these phones and they both froze up and didn't work properly.. 
Summary:. This phone isn't worth getting in my opinion. Unless you aren't using it for more then calling. I would much rather have kept my old flip phone if it didn't break. Tomorrow I am getting the samsung intensity to replace the LG Cosmos.. 

$$;
Pros:. QWERTY, no data plan required. 
Cons:. No video, camera is lower res, phone feels "cheap" and is a bit heavy and clumsy.. 
Summary:. Unfortunately, Verizon options for those without data plans are very limited. There are 47 phones on their website and only 13 can be purchased without a data plan. Half of the phones require the $30 per month plan. Of course, they want us to buy a more expensive data plan, so the more attractive phones require these plans. I wanted a QWERTY for texting because I have a very difficult time using with the numeric key pad. The Cosmos was one of only two choices with a QWERTY, and the only one free with my two-year credit. I had an EnV for years and loved it, but it now requires a data plan, too. So, I thought the Cosmos was a good compromise. However, the quality of this phone is questionable. Like another poster here, I think the slide mechanism is iffy. The keys also have a weird feedback which makes them feel like they are worn out, even though the phone is brand new. The balance of the phone when using the QWERTY is really odd. It's hard to explain, other than to say texting with the QWERTY just feels very awkward. Also, my four-year-old EnV had a 2.0 MP camera - this phone has a 1.3 MP. The camera is hard to use. You really have to hold the phone in the horizontal position to use the camera because of the spacing of the camera control buttons. Also, you have to really jam the camera button to get it to activate. I just can't recommend this phone and I am very disappointed. I would love to take it back but between Verizon's ridiculous restocking fee and lack of choices, I really don't have an option.. 

$$;
Pros:. Keyboard, good picture quality, decent call quality. 
Cons:. For a "messaging phone" it sure is pretty slow. Freezes frequently, speaker phone button gets in the way frequently, no video messaging, restarts itself frequently. 
Summary:. Less than a week after I got the phone it began restarting itself and got to the Verizon welcome screen only to restart itself again. It freezes in the middle of text messages frequently and I have to take out the battery in order to get it working again. It's always 5 steps behind me when I'm typing a text message-very slow for a "messaging phone" in my opinion. Overall, I'm very disappointed with this LG and am looking forward to getting a new phone already. 

$$;
Pros:. I love the qwerty keyboard, the camera takes amazing pictures, and I love the messaging settings which allow you to increase font and so forth. 
Cons:. Technical Issues on LG's end. 
Summary:. I bought this phone in May and immediately starting having issues, the phone wouldn't charge. I was back at the store exchanging less than a week after the purchase. My second phone (new) started resetting itself less than two weeks after getting it. It would restart and only get to the Verizon logo before restarting all over again. My third phone (refurbished and mailed to me) started doing the same thing again after only two weeks. My forth and current phone (again refurbished) has had some minor problems with the same issue but restarts all the way. It is tolerable. What I cant understand is, Verizon says if I want to change to a different model of the same price I have to pay the taxes. DIDN'T I PAY TAXES ON THE ORIGINAL ONE I WANT REPLACED? Whats the big deal? I will manage with this one until I can afford to get a new.. Bottom line - DONT PURCHACE THIS PHONE BECAUSE LG ACKNOWLEDGES THERE ARE TECHNICAL ISSUES WITH IT!!!!!!. 

$$;
Pros:. Keyboard, pretty good pictures.. 
Cons:. Freezes, the front doesn't work as fast as the keyboard, battery life sucks.. 
Summary:. I got this phone about a week ago and it's terrible. It froze twice and while I was texting on the front instead of using the keyboard, the front keys stopped working. The keys on the keyboard hurt my fingers because they're so far apart. The battery life sucks unless you follow specific directions on how to charge it. This phone is good for old people who don't mind texting at the speed of stop but, terrible for teenagers. Don't get it. You will be disappointed.. 

$$;
Pros:. The design is great, solid phone (doesn't feel too cheap). 
Cons:. FREEZES CONSTANTLY, qwerty keyboard keys need a lot of pressure to register. 
Summary:. I received this phone in the mail two days ago, activated it, and for the most part it was a great phone! Loved the features and factory sounds that came on the phone. However, WITHIN 6 HOURS OF OPERATION every time I typed any keys in the bottom row of the qwerty keyboard the phone would add every key from that row (eg. I hit "m" and "xcvbnmm" would follow, automatically, this was not solely in texting either, as the same problem occured in searching for contacts, notepad, etc... Then the problems increased, as the keyboard started to freeze, and now I have to remove the battery and leave it out for at least a minute and then turn it on with the phone slid open to even be able to accomplish one task on the phone. You wont be able to pick up calls, use the alarm, etc... within thirty seconds of the phone turning on. Also, if you're expecting to do something after a call, NOPE, you have to "soft reset" the phone again. Do not be fooled by the great reviews, I had done HARD research to find a good phone before I got this, but as soon as this happened I searched it in google and THOUSANDS of complaints came up about this phone freezing. I am going back to verizon today and getting a completely different phone, and for that fact, a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT BRAND. I had an lg env3 before this and that one would constantly turn off. LG, I used to love you but you're dropping the ball, they've now exchanged quality for quantity, a movement that I sure don't want to be a part of.. Outside of these problems, I can give an honest review. The phone is a great messaging phone, although you have to press the keys on the qwerty keyboard with some force, but I found this a plus as there weren't as many "goof-ups" during typing, but it did slow my typing speed down. The menus are laid out like any other LG phone, with the options for grid, list, and tab view. The graphics are beautiful on this phone, but I thought the picture quality was lacking what the EnV3 had brought to the table (flash, white balance settings, etc...). The locking feature on the phone was great, and you could set it for 1-key unlock or 2-key unlock. The features are limited, but you can send facebook, twitter, and myspace updates via text message on the phone as they have a dedicated social networking app on the phone. The texting is great, but the threading view is a little confusing on this phone. As far as battery life goes, I really cant speak on this subject, as there was only one day when the phone was fully operating, and I didn't really monitor my use.. Regardless of my review and the praise I give on the features, do not buy this phone, as nice as the interface may seem, this phone is a great example of what LG is turning into, my family used to have LG phones and we loved them, but since we've upgraded and gotten more LG's, they seriously STINK. Don't do it.. 

$$;
Pros:. nice key board. good organization of your txt messages. 
Cons:. they say "speed kills" yea only problem is its speed that kills my time. 
Summary:. I would certainly have no problem calling this phone a decent phone if it wasnt for one thing. the speed. From the day i first got the phone. It was slow, you could click ok to get to your menu or i could start typing and the phone is just a step behind you. Now i have had the phone for about a month and i havnt dropped or caused it any physical or mental pain, quite frankly, i was very nice to it. And now, i can litterally type 5-7 words b4 the first letter appears...so you have to type wait...type wait....its rly fun. 

$$;
Pros:. easy to use, good reception, sound quality. 
Cons:. phone locks up, turns itself off and on. fourth phone replacement and still the sameissues. 
Summary:. Verizon is a good company who resolves problems for their customers. But this phone has proven to repeatedly be problematic. 

$$;
Pros:. The ONLY pro for this phone is sound quality.. 
Cons:. The camera is horrible.. Texting lags horribly, you can have an entire text message typed out and it will still be on the first word.. Picture messages take over 5 minutes to send.. Battery life is lacking. Unlock buttons are inconvenient. 
Summary:. I bought this phone about 3 months ago because of it's price and the fact it had a keyboard.. I also did not want a data plan or smart phone because I don't feel I would use all of the features.. When I first got this phone I noticed that while sliding it open it sounded creaky and unstable, so I learned to be quite gentle with it because of fear that it was just going to fall apart.. This IS a messaging phone but while text messaging you'll notice that it lags quite a bit, to the point where you can have an entire message typed out and there are no words on your screen.. Now, my problem with this phone is that it WILL NOT CHARGE. When I plug the phone in the battery icon on the phone does act as though it is charging but it actually isn't. This means for the phone to be on it has to be plugged in at all times. When going to address this problem I was told I needed a new battery, after 3 months of use mind you. I did buy the new battery, along with a new charger and it has not fixed the problem at all.. Please DO NOT waste your money on this phone spend the extra 50 bucks to get something that will actually work, because if you don't in a few months you'll be in the market for another phone.. If you feel as though a cellphone should complicate your life,add more stress or frustrate you everyday this phone's for you!. 

$$;
Pros:. the only thing i like about this phone is that it saves messages as conversations. and that it is somewhat functional.. 
Cons:. Ok, this is a long list! 1)very laggy phone even with memory cleared. 2) phone is constantly restarting (all 4 phones my family has does this!) 3) has alot of trouble signing into all messenger services. 4)horrible camera 5)inconvienient lock botton!. 
Summary:. Basically I wasted my upgrade on this horrible phone and I dont ever want anyone else to go thru the same BS that im going thru. So this phone is THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER HAD (and i havehad many basic and smart phones)! Also, the phone becomes so laggy, that it becomes hard to navigate! Don't waste ur time on this product just cause its cheap, fork out the extra 20 or 30 bucks to get something better than this! O.
