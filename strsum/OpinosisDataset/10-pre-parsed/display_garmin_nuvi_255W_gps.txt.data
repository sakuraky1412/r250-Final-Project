3 quot  widescreen display was a bonus .

also, if you're searching for a business, it displays the phone number .

the bad ,  my unit only displays elevation contours at zoom levels of 20 miles or higher .

it also can display and speak many languages .

the garmin has a nice 3d display .

the 750 just displays text on the top line for upcoming turns without the arrow .

well when i saw that the 255w had the next turn proudly displayed in the upper left corner i jumped at it .

the 255 also automatically adjusts the font size of displayed text so that even lengthy text will fit .

through this option you can find sub, options which will allow you to change the language  , set display, navigation, time, map, and security preferences .

but is impossible to display them and your current position simultaneously .
