the/DT hotel/NN 's/POS sister/NN property/NN in/IN shane/NN ,/, the/DT conyngham/NN arms/NNS hotel/NN is/VBZ well/RB worth/IN a/DT visit/NN with/IN an/DT excellent/JJ bistro/NN restaurant/NN ,/, a/DT roaring/VBG fire/NN and/CC of/IN course/NN a/DT great/JJ pint/NN of/IN guinness/NN ./.

we/PRP were/VBD also/RB shown/VBN a/DT couple/NN of/IN the/DT 6/CD rooms/NNS in/IN the/DT main/JJ house/NN which/WDT are/VBP beautifully/RB decorated/VBN with/IN wonderful/JJ views/NNS over/IN the/DT estate/NN and/CC would/MD be/VB a/DT good/JJ choice/NN ./.

this/DT was/VBD not/RB the/DT case/NN as/IN most/JJS of/IN the/DT ingredients/NNS had/VBD clearly/RB be/VB pre-cooked/JJ and/CC sat/VBD long/RB enough/RB to/TO dry/VB out/RP ,/, so/IN the/DT bacon/NN ,/, sausage/NN and/CC irish/JJ black/JJ pudding/NN were/VBD all/DT dried/VBN out/RP ./.

the/DT kitchen/NN is/VBZ fully/RB equipped/VBN with/IN a/DT supply/NN of/IN coffee/NN ,/, tea/NN ,/, snacks/NNS and/CC fresh/JJ milk/NN in/IN the/DT fridge/NN ./.

the/DT main/JJ house/NN itself/PRP has/VBZ some/DT beautifully/RB appointed/VBN sitting/VBG rooms/NNS which/WDT are/VBP a/DT wonderful/JJ spot/NN to/TO sit/VB back/RB and/CC relax/VB with/IN a/DT good/JJ book/NN ./.

having/VBG your/PRP$ own/JJ living/NN room/kitchen/diner/NN plus/CC double/JJ bedroom/NN and/CC bathroom/NN upstairs/NN is/VBZ great/JJ value/NN for/IN the/DT price/NN of/IN what/WP normally/RB only/RB gets/VBZ you/PRP a/DT hotel/NN room/NN ./.

unfortunately/RB ,/, as/IN noted/VBN by/IN other/JJ reviewers/NNS ,/, the/DT breakfast/NN was/VBD just/RB the/DT opposite/JJ and/CC a/DT real/JJ disappointment/NN ./.

we/PRP had/VBD dinner/NN in/IN the/DT brabazon/NN restaurant/NN which/WDT again/RB at/IN eur45/CD per/IN head/NN for/IN a/DT 5/CD course/NN dinner/NN was/VBD outstanding/JJ value/NN ./.

when/WRB promised/VBN a/DT ``/`` full/JJ irish/JJ breakfast/NN ''/'' at/IN this/DT level/NN the/DT least/JJS you/PRP can/MD expect/VB is/VBZ that/IN it/PRP be/VB freshly/RB cooked/VBN to/TO order/NN ./.

the/DT hotel/NN is/VBZ close/JJ to/TO some/DT fascinating/JJ sites/NNS to/TO visit/VB ,/, such/JJ as/IN newgrange/NN and/CC slane/NN castle/NN ./.

all/DT in/IN all/DT ,/, a/DT lovely/JJ property/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT breakfast/NN must/MD be/VB improved/VBN ./.

although/IN we/PRP were/VBD not/RB able/JJ to/TO enjoy/VB it/PRP due/JJ to/TO the/DT poor/JJ weather/NN ,/, there/EX are/VBP also/RB some/DT beautiful/JJ gardens/NNS to/TO enjoy/VB along/RP with/IN the/DT hot/JJ tub/NN ./.

the/DT food/NN was/VBD of/IN a/DT high/JJ quality/NN without/IN being/VBG at/IN all/DT pretentious/JJ ./.

my/PRP$ wife/NN and/CC i/FW stayed/VBN recently/RB in/IN one/CD of/IN the/DT courtyard/NN cottages/NNS on/IN an/DT admittedly/RB foul/JJ weather/NN weekend/NN ./.

the/DT cottage/NN was/VBD warm/JJ and/CC cosy/JJ and/CC very/RB well/RB appointed/VBN ./.

the/DT shane/NN bake/NN bakery/NN is/VBZ also/RB not/RB to/TO be/VB missed/VBN !/. !/.

this/DT is/VBZ such/JJ as/IN shame/NN and/CC so/RB easily/RB fixed/VBN ./.

despite/IN asking/VBG for/IN fried/JJ eggs/NNS easy-over/NN ,/, we/PRP were/VBD both/DT served/VBD with/IN hard/JJ eggs/NNS which/WDT we/PRP returned/VBD ./.

service/NN was/VBD friendly/JJ and/CC efficient/JJ and/CC welcoming/JJ ./.

a/DT very/RB enjoyable/JJ dinner/NN ./.
