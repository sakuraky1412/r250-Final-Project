JUST RIGHT.
as advertised.
Great.
All was fine, product was as advertised.
The all-plastic insert ones are better than the ones with the metal ones - I used one of the metal inserts ones and after a short while the insert just spun inside of the coupler, which made me have to replace it AND pry off the metal insert from the shaft, which was the most annoying part.
Very satisfied I love these prices and prompt  courteous service.
