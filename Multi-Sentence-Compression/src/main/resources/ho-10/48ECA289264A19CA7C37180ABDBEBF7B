despite having paid in advance , the next day i went to the caf√© reichard opposite the cathedral where breakfast is brought to you for a fraction of the price ( there is also a buffet ) .
then i went for a fruit salad , and returned to find my place swept away , including my newspaper ( an english-language ft - the only plus point ) .
of course , the staff tried to retrieve the situation , but why was i given only ten minutes for breakfast in the first place ?
after two circuits , when the only available places had been opposite other singles , i saw a place and noted that the guest who had been sitting opposite was not at the buffet , so i quickly went for an orange juice to lay claim to the place .
this is the third time in a row in german-austrian accor hotels ( sofitel hamburg , mgallery vienna ) that i have been given the push in favour of groups .
then i went back for a cereal , a roll and a pastry ( there was no choice of pastries ) .
i had also noted that the room had emptied by the time my place was swept away , in other words there were groups .
by the end of the cereal , i had to wave for attention to order coffee .
i also liked the immediate access to channels without having to go through a tedious menu , including trying to sell me porno .
a novelty was an hdtv with an impressive range of world-wide channels , including for brits ( less so for francophones ) .
