mileage a little disappointing .

this new one gets even better mileage, averages about 33 freeway .

mileage is mediocre at an average of 25 .

the mileage queen has put 55,000 miles on  ricky  since sept 06   .

good gas mileage, comfortable seating, lots of leg room .

it gets great mileage, and runs great .

powerfull, quiet, good gas mileage, excellent workmanship, good audio system .

good acceleration for engine size, and good mileage, especially when highway cruising around 70 mph   .

highway mileage already greater than promised .

my previous bmw 3 series got better mileage, and believe me it was more fun to drive .
